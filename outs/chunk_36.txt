# <details>: The Details disclosure element

The **`<details>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element creates a disclosure widget in which information is visible only when the widget is toggled into an open state. A summary or label must be provided using the {{HTMLElement("summary")}} element.

A disclosure widget is typically presented onscreen using a small triangle that rotates (or twists) to indicate open/closed state, with a label next to the triangle. The contents of the `<summary>` element are used as the label for the disclosure widget. The contents of the `<details>` provide the {{glossary("accessible description")}} for the `<summary>`.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;details&gt;", "tabbed-shorter")}}

```html interactive-example
<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  Something small enough to escape casual notice.
</details>
```

```css interactive-example
details {
  border: 1px solid #aaaaaa;
  border-radius: 4px;
  padding: 0.5em 0.5em 0;
}

summary {
  font-weight: bold;
  margin: -0.5em -0.5em 0;
  padding: 0.5em;
}

details[open] {
  padding: 0.5em;
}

details[open] summary {
  border-bottom: 1px solid #aaaaaa;
  margin-bottom: 0.5em;
}
```

A `<details>` widget can be in one of two states. The default _closed_ state displays only the triangle and the label inside `<summary>` (or a {{Glossary("user agent")}}-defined default string if no `<summary>`).

When the user clicks on the widget or focuses it then presses the space bar, it "twists" open, revealing its contents. The common use of a triangle which rotates or twists around to represent opening or closing the widget is why these are sometimes called "twisty".

You can use CSS to style the disclosure widget, and you can programmatically open and close the widget by setting/removing its [`open`](#open) attribute. Unfortunately, at this time, there's no built-in way to animate the transition between open and closed.

By default when closed, the widget is only tall enough to display the disclosure triangle and summary. When open, it expands to display the details contained within.

Fully standards-compliant implementations automatically apply the CSS `{{cssxref("display")}}: list-item` to the {{HTMLElement("summary")}} element. You can use this or the {{cssxref("::marker")}} pseudo-element to [customize the disclosure widget](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/summary#changing_the_summarys_icon).

## Attributes

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

- `open`
  - : This Boolean attribute indicates whether the details — that is, the contents of the `<details>` element — are currently visible. The details are shown when this attribute exists, or hidden when this attribute is absent. By default this attribute is absent which means the details are not visible.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You have to remove this attribute entirely to make the details hidden. `open="false"` makes the details visible because this attribute is Boolean.

- `name`
  - : This attribute enables multiple `<details>` elements to be connected, with only one open at a time. This allows developers to easily create UI features such as accordions without scripting.

    The `name` attribute specifies a group name — give multiple `<details>` elements the same `name` value to group them. Only one of the grouped `<details>` elements can be open at a time — opening one will cause another to close. If multiple grouped `<details>` elements are given the `open` attribute, only the first one in the source order will be rendered open.

    > [!NOTE]
    > `<details>` elements don't have to be adjacent to one another in the source to be part of the same group.

## Events

In addition to the usual events supported by HTML elements, the `<details>` element supports the {{domxref("HTMLElement/toggle_event", "toggle")}} event, which is dispatched to the `<details>` element whenever its state changes between open and closed. It is sent _after_ the state is changed, although if the state changes multiple times before the browser can dispatch the event, the events are coalesced so that only one is sent.

You can use an event listener for the `toggle` event to detect when the widget changes state:

```js
details.addEventListener("toggle", (event) => {
  if (details.open) {
    /* the element was toggled open */
  } else {
    /* the element was toggled closed */
  }
});
```

## Examples

### A basic disclosure example

This example shows a basic `<details>` element with a `<summary>`.

```html
<details>
  <summary>System Requirements</summary>
  <p>
    Requires a computer running an operating system. The computer must have some
    memory and ideally some kind of long-term storage. An input device as well
    as some form of output device is recommended.
  </p>
</details>
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("A_basic_disclosure_example", 650, 150)}}

### Creating an open disclosure box

To start the `<details>` box in its open state, add the Boolean `open` attribute:

```html
<details open>
  <summary>System Requirements</summary>
  <p>
    Requires a computer running an operating system. The computer must have some
    memory and ideally some kind of long-term storage. An input device as well
    as some form of output device is recommended.
  </p>
</details>
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Creating_an_open_disclosure_box", 650, 150)}}

### Multiple named disclosure boxes

We include several `<details>` boxes, all with the same name so only one can be open at a time:

```html
<details name="requirements">
  <summary>Graduation Requirements</summary>
  <p>
    Requires 40 credits, including a passing grade in health, geography,
    history, economics, and wood shop.
  </p>
</details>
<details name="requirements">
  <summary>System Requirements</summary>
  <p>
    Requires a computer running an operating system. The computer must have some
    memory and ideally some kind of long-term storage. An input device as well
    as some form of output device is recommended.
  </p>
</details>
<details name="requirements">
  <summary>Job Requirements</summary>
  <p>
    Requires knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, accessibility, web performance,
    privacy, security, and internationalization, as well as a dislike of
    broccoli.
  </p>
</details>
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Multiple named disclosure boxes", 650, 150)}}

Try opening all the disclosure widgets. When you open one, all the others automatically close.

### Customizing the appearance

Now let's apply some CSS to customize the appearance of the disclosure box.

#### CSS

```css
details {
  font:
    16px "Open Sans",
    "Calibri",
    sans-serif;
  width: 620px;
}

details > summary {
  padding: 2px 6px;
  width: 15em;
  background-color: #dddddd;
  border: none;
  box-shadow: 3px 3px 4px black;
  cursor: pointer;
}

details > p {
  border-radius: 0 0 10px 10px;
  background-color: #dddddd;
  padding: 2px 6px;
  margin: 0;
  box-shadow: 3px 3px 4px black;
}

details:open > summary {
  background-color: #ccccff;
}
```

This CSS creates a look similar to a tabbed interface, where clicking the tab opens it to reveal its contents.

> [!NOTE]
> In browsers that don't support the {{cssxref(":open")}} pseudo-class, you can use the attribute selector `details[open]` to style the `<details>` element when it is in the open state.

#### HTML

```html
<details>
  <summary>System Requirements</summary>
  <p>
    Requires a computer running an operating system. The computer must have some
    memory and ideally some kind of long-term storage. An input device as well
    as some form of output device is recommended.
  </p>
</details>
```

# <dfn>: The Definition element

The **`<dfn>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element indicates a term to be defined. The `<dfn>` element should be used in a complete definition statement, where the full definition of the term can be one of the following:

- The ancestor paragraph (a block of text, sometimes marked by a {{HTMLElement("p")}} element)
- The {{HTMLElement("dt")}}/{{HTMLElement("dd")}} pairing
- The nearest [section](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Content_categories#sectioning_content) ancestor of the `<dfn>` element,

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;dfn&gt;", "tabbed-shorter")}}

```html interactive-example
<p>
  A <dfn id="def-validator">validator</dfn> is a program that checks for syntax
  errors in code or documents.
</p>
```

```css interactive-example
dfn {
  /* Add your styles here */
}
```

## Attributes

This element's attributes include the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

The [`title`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/title) attribute has special meaning, as noted below.

## Usage notes

There are some not-entirely-obvious aspects to using the `<dfn>` element. We examine those here.

### Specifying the term being defined

The term being defined is identified following these rules:

1. If the `<dfn>` element has a [`title`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/title) attribute, the value of the `title` attribute is considered to be the term being defined. The element must still have text within it, but that text may be an abbreviation (perhaps using {{HTMLElement("abbr")}}) or another form of the term.
2. If the `<dfn>` contains a single child element and does not have any text content of its own, and the child element is an {{HTMLElement("abbr")}} element with a `title` attribute itself, then the exact value of the `<abbr>` element's `title` is the term being defined.
3. Otherwise, the text content of the `<dfn>` element is the term being defined. This is shown [in the first example below](#basic_identification_of_a_term).

> [!NOTE]
> If the `<dfn>` element has a `title` attribute, it _must_ contain the term being defined and no other text.

### Links to `<dfn>` elements

If you include an [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/id) attribute on the `<dfn>` element, you can then link to it using {{HTMLElement("a")}} elements. Such links should be uses of the term, with the intent being that the reader can quickly navigate to the term's definition if they're not already aware of it, by clicking on the term's link.

This is shown in the example under [Links to definitions](#links_to_definitions) below.

## Examples

Let's take a look at some examples of various usage scenarios.

### Basic identification of a term

This example uses a plain `<dfn>` element to identify the location of a term within the definition.

#### HTML

```html
<p>
  The <strong>HTML Definition element (<dfn>&lt;dfn&gt;</dfn>)</strong> is used
  to indicate the term being defined within the context of a definition phrase
  or sentence.
</p>
```

Since the `<dfn>` element has no `title`, the text contents of the `<dfn>` element itself are used as the term being defined.

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Basic_identification_of_a_term", 650, 120)}}

### Links to definitions

To add links to the definitions, you create the link the same way you always do, with the {{HTMLElement("a")}} element.

#### HTML

```html-nolint
<p>
  The
  <strong>HTML Definition element (<dfn id="definition-dfn">&lt;dfn&gt;</dfn>)</strong>
  is used to indicate the term being defined within the context of a definition
  phrase or sentence.
</p>

<p>
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Graece donan, Latine
  voluptatem vocant. Confecta res esset. Duo Reges: constructio interrete.
  Scrupulum, inquam, abeunti;
</p>

<p>
  Because of all of that, we decided to use the
  <code><a href="#definition-dfn">&lt;dfn&gt;</a></code> element for this
  project.
</p>
```

Here we see the definition — now with an [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/id) attribute, `"definition-dfn"`, which can be used as the target of a link. Later on, a link is created using `<a>` with the [`href`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/a#href) attribute set to `"#definition-dfn"` to set up the link back to the definition.

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Links_to_definitions", 650, 300)}}

### Using abbreviations and definitions together

In some cases, you may wish to use an abbreviation for a term when defining it. This can be done by using the `<dfn>` and {{HTMLElement("abbr")}} elements in tandem, like this:

#### HTML

```html
<p>
  The <dfn><abbr title="Hubble Space Telescope">HST</abbr></dfn> is among the
  most productive scientific instruments ever constructed. It has been in orbit
  for over 20 years, scanning the sky and returning data and photographs of
  unprecedented quality and detail.
</p>

<p>
  Indeed, the <abbr title="Hubble Space Telescope">HST</abbr> has arguably done
  more to advance science than any device ever built.
</p>
```

Note the `<abbr>` element nested inside the `<dfn>`. The former establishes that the term is an abbreviation ("HST") and specifies the full term ("Hubble Space Telescope") in its `title` attribute. The latter indicates that the abbreviated term represents a term being defined.

# <dialog>: The Dialog element

The **`<dialog>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a modal or non-modal dialog box or other interactive component, such as a dismissible alert, inspector, or subwindow.

The HTML `<dialog>` element is used to create both modal and non-modal dialog boxes. Modal dialog boxes interrupt interaction with the rest of the page being inert, while non-modal dialog boxes allow interaction with the rest of the page.

JavaScript should be used to display the `<dialog>` element. Use the {{domxref("HTMLDialogElement.showModal()", ".showModal()")}} method to display a modal dialog and the {{domxref("HTMLDialogElement.show()", ".show()")}} method to display a non-modal dialog. The dialog box can be closed using the {{domxref("HTMLDialogElement.close()", ".close()")}} method or using the [`dialog`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#method) method when submitting a `<form>` that is nested within the `<dialog>` element. Modal dialogs can also be closed by pressing the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key.

## Attributes

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

> [!WARNING]
> The `tabindex` attribute must not be used on the `<dialog>` element. See [usage notes](#usage_notes).

- `closedby`
  - : Specifies the types of user actions that can be used to close the `<dialog>` element. This attribute distinguishes three methods by which a dialog might be closed:
    - A _light dismiss user action_, in which the `<dialog>` is closed when the user clicks or taps outside it. This is equivalent to the ["light dismiss" behavior of "auto" state popovers](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API/Using#auto_state_and_light_dismiss).
    - A _platform-specific user action_, such as pressing the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key on desktop platforms, or a "back" or "dismiss" gesture on mobile platforms.
    - A developer-specified mechanism such as a {{htmlelement("button")}} with a [`click`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event) handler that invokes {{domxref("HTMLDialogElement.close()")}} or a {{htmlelement("form")}} submission.

    Possible values are:
    - `any`
      - : The dialog can be dismissed using any of the three methods.
    - `closerequest`
      - : The dialog can be dismissed with a platform-specific user action or a developer-specified mechanism.
    - `none`
      - : The dialog can only be dismissed with a developer-specified mechanism.

    If the `<dialog>` element does not have a valid `closedby` value specified, then
    - if it was opened using {{domxref("HTMLDialogElement.showModal()", "showModal()")}}, it behaves as if the value was `"closerequest"`
    - otherwise, it behaves as if the value was `"none"`.

- `open`
  - : Indicates that the dialog box is active and is available for interaction. If the `open` attribute is not set, the dialog box will not be visible to the user.
    It is recommended to use the `.show()` or `.showModal()` method to render dialogs, rather than the `open` attribute. If a `<dialog>` is opened using the `open` attribute, it is non-modal.

    > [!NOTE]
    > While you can toggle between the open and closed states of non-modal dialog boxes by toggling the presence of the `open` attribute, this approach is not recommended. See {{domxref("HTMLDialogElement.open", "open")}} for more information.

## Usage notes

- HTML {{HTMLElement("form")}} elements can be used to close a dialog box if they have the attribute `method="dialog"` or if the button used to submit the form has [`formmethod="dialog"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#formmethod) set. When a `<form>` within a `<dialog>` is submitted via the `dialog` method, the dialog box closes, the states of the form controls are saved but not submitted, and the {{domxref("HTMLDialogElement.returnValue", "returnValue")}} property gets set to the value of the button that was activated.
- The CSS {{cssxref('::backdrop')}} pseudo-element can be used to style the backdrop of a modal dialog, which is displayed behind the `<dialog>` element when the dialog is displayed using the {{domxref("HTMLDialogElement.showModal()")}} method. For example, this pseudo-element could be used to blur, darken, or otherwise obfuscate the inert content behind the modal dialog.
- The [`autofocus`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/autofocus) attribute should be added to the element the user is expected to interact with immediately upon opening a modal dialog. If no other element involves more immediate interaction, it is recommended to add `autofocus` to the close button inside the dialog, or the dialog itself if the user is expected to click/activate it to dismiss.
- Do not add the `tabindex` property to the `<dialog>` element as it is not interactive and does not receive focus. The dialog's contents, including the close button contained in the dialog, can receive focus and be interactive.

## Accessibility

When implementing a dialog, it is important to consider the most appropriate place to set user focus. When using {{domxref("HTMLDialogElement.showModal()")}} to open a `<dialog>`, focus is set on the first nested focusable element. Explicitly indicating the initial focus placement by using the [`autofocus`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/autofocus) attribute will help ensure initial focus is set on the element deemed the best initial focus placement for any particular dialog. When in doubt, as it may not always be known where initial focus could be set within a dialog, particularly for instances where a dialog's content is dynamically rendered when invoked, the `<dialog>` element itself may provide the best initial focus placement.

Ensure a mechanism is provided to allow users to close the dialog. The most robust way to ensure that all users can close the dialog is to include an explicit button to do so, such as a confirmation, cancellation, or close button.

By default, a dialog invoked by the `showModal()` method can be dismissed by pressing the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key. A non-modal dialog does not dismiss via the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key by default, and depending on what the non-modal dialog represents, it may not be desired for this behavior. Keyboard users expect the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key to close modal dialogs; ensure that this behavior is implemented and maintained. If multiple modal dialogs are open, pressing the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key should close only the last shown dialog. When using `<dialog>`, this behavior is provided by the browser.

While dialogs can be created using other elements, the native `<dialog>` element provides usability and accessibility features that must be replicated if you use other elements for a similar purpose. If you're creating a custom dialog implementation, ensure that all expected default behaviors are supported and proper labeling recommendations are followed.

The `<dialog>` element is exposed by browsers in a manner similar to custom dialogs that use the ARIA [role="dialog"](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/dialog_role) attribute. `<dialog>` elements invoked by the `showModal()` method implicitly have [aria-modal="true"](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-modal), whereas `<dialog>` elements invoked by the `show()` method or displayed using the `open` attribute or by changing the default `display` of a `<dialog>` are exposed as `[aria-modal="false"]`. When implementing modal dialogs, everything other than the `<dialog>` and its contents should be rendered inert using the [`inert`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/inert) attribute. When using `<dialog>` along with the `HTMLDialogElement.showModal()` method, this behavior is provided by the browser.

## Examples

### HTML-only dialog

This example demonstrates the creation of a non-modal dialog by using only HTML. Because of the boolean `open` attribute in the `<dialog>` element, the dialog appears open when the page loads. The dialog can be closed by clicking the "OK" button because the `method` attribute in the `<form>` element is set to `"dialog"`. In this case, no JavaScript is needed to close the form.

```html
<dialog open>
  <p>Greetings, one and all!</p>
  <form method="dialog">
    <button>OK</button>
  </form>
</dialog>
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("HTML-only_dialog", "100%", 200)}}

> [!NOTE]
> Reload the page to reset the output.

This dialog is initially open because of the presence of the `open` attribute. Dialogs that are displayed using the `open` attribute are non-modal. After clicking "OK", the dialog gets dismissed, leaving the Result frame empty. When the dialog is dismissed, there is no method provided to reopen it. For this reason, the preferred method to display non-modal dialogs is by using the {{domxref("HTMLDialogElement.show()")}} method. It is possible to toggle the display of the dialog by adding or removing the boolean `open` attribute, but it is not the recommended practice.

### Creating a modal dialog

This example demonstrates a modal dialog with a [gradient](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient) backdrop. The `.showModal()` method opens the modal dialog when the "Show the dialog" button is activated. The dialog can be closed by pressing the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key or via the `close()` method when the "Close" button within the dialog is activated.

When a dialog opens, the browser, by default, gives focus to the first element that can be focused within the dialog. In this example, the [`autofocus`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/autofocus) attribute is applied to the "Close" button, giving it focus when the dialog opens, as this is the element we expect the user will interact with immediately after the dialog opens.

#### HTML

```html
<dialog>
  <button autofocus>Close</button>
  <p>This modal dialog has a groovy backdrop!</p>
</dialog>
<button>Show the dialog</button>
```

#### CSS

We can style the backdrop of the dialog by using the {{cssxref('::backdrop')}} pseudo-element.

```css
::backdrop {
  background-image: linear-gradient(
    45deg,
    magenta,
    rebeccapurple,
    dodgerblue,
    green
  );
  opacity: 0.75;
}
```

#### JavaScript

The dialog is opened modally using the `.showModal()` method and closed using the `.close()` or `.requestClose()` methods.

```js
const dialog = document.querySelector("dialog");
const showButton = document.querySelector("dialog + button");
const closeButton = document.querySelector("dialog button");

// "Show the dialog" button opens the dialog modally
showButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
  dialog.showModal();
});

// "Close" button closes the dialog
closeButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
  dialog.close();
});
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Creating_a_modal_dialog", "100%", 200)}}

When the modal dialog is displayed, it appears above any other dialogs that might be present. Everything outside the modal dialog is inert and interactions outside the dialog are blocked. Notice that when the dialog is open, with the exception of the dialog itself, interaction with the document is not possible; the "Show the dialog" button is mostly obfuscated by the almost opaque backdrop of the dialog and is inert.

### Handling the return value from the dialog

This example demonstrates the [`returnValue`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDialogElement/returnValue) of the `<dialog>` element and how to close a modal dialog by using a form. By default, the `returnValue` is the empty string or the value of the button that submits the form within the `<dialog>` element, if there is one.

This example opens a modal dialog when the "Show the dialog" button is activated. The dialog contains a form with a {{HTMLElement("select")}} and two {{HTMLElement("button")}} elements, which default to `type="submit"`. An event listener updates the value of the "Confirm" button when the select option changes. If the "Confirm" button is activated to close the dialog, the current value of the button is the return value. If the dialog is closed by pressing the "Cancel" button, the `returnValue` is `cancel`.

When the dialog is closed, the return value is displayed under the "Show the dialog" button. If the dialog is closed by pressing the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key, the `returnValue` is not updated, and the `close` event doesn't occur, so the text in the {{HTMLElement("output")}} is not updated.

#### HTML

```html
<!-- A modal dialog containing a form -->
<dialog id="favDialog">
  <form>
    <p>
      <label>
        Favorite animal:
        <select>
          <option value="default">Choose…</option>
          <option>Brine shrimp</option>
          <option>Red panda</option>
          <option>Spider monkey</option>
        </select>
      </label>
    </p>
    <div>
      <button value="cancel" formmethod="dialog">Cancel</button>
      <button id="confirmBtn" value="default">Confirm</button>
    </div>
  </form>
</dialog>
<p>
  <button id="showDialog">Show the dialog</button>
</p>
<output></output>
```

#### JavaScript

```js
const showButton = document.getElementById("showDialog");
const favDialog = document.getElementById("favDialog");
const outputBox = document.querySelector("output");
const selectEl = favDialog.querySelector("select");
const confirmBtn = favDialog.querySelector("#confirmBtn");

// "Show the dialog" button opens the <dialog> modally
showButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
  favDialog.showModal();
});

// "Cancel" button closes the dialog without submitting because of [formmethod="dialog"], triggering a close event.
favDialog.addEventListener("close", (e) => {
  outputBox.value =
    favDialog.returnValue === "default"
      ? "No return value."
      : `ReturnValue: ${favDialog.returnValue}.`; // Have to check for "default" rather than empty string
});

// Prevent the "confirm" button from the default behavior of submitting the form, and close the dialog with the `close()` method, which triggers the "close" event.
confirmBtn.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  event.preventDefault(); // We don't want to submit this fake form
  favDialog.close(selectEl.value); // Have to send the select box value here.
});
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Handling the return value from the dialog", "100%", 300)}}

The above examples demonstrate the following three methods of closing modal dialogs:

- By submitting the form within the dialog form using the `dialog` method (as seen in the [HTML-only example](#html-only_dialog)).
- By pressing the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key.
- By calling the {{domxref("HTMLDialogElement.close()")}} method (as seen in the [modal example](#creating_a_modal_dialog)).
  In this example, the "Cancel" button closes the dialog via the `dialog` form method and the "Confirm" button closes the dialog via the {{domxref("HTMLDialogElement.close()")}} method.

The "Cancel" button includes the [`formmethod="dialog"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/submit#formmethod) attribute, which overrides the {{HTMLElement("form")}}'s default {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} method. When a form's method is [`dialog`](#usage_notes), the state of the form is saved but not submitted, and the dialog gets closed.

Without an `action`, submitting the form via the default {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} method causes a page to reload. We use JavaScript to prevent the submission and close the dialog with the {{domxref("event.preventDefault()")}} and {{domxref("HTMLDialogElement.close()")}} methods, respectively.

It is important to provide a closing mechanism within every `dialog` element. The <kbd>Esc</kbd> key does not close non-modal dialogs by default, nor can one assume that a user will even have access to a physical keyboard (e.g., someone using a touch screen device without access to a keyboard).

### Closing a dialog with a required form input

When a form inside a dialog has a required input, the user agent will only let you close the dialog once you provide a value for the required input. To close such dialog, either use the [`formnovalidate`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#formnovalidate) attribute on the close button or call the `close()` method on the dialog object when the close button is clicked.

```html
<dialog id="dialog">
  <form method="dialog">
    <p>
      <label>
        Favorite animal:
        <input type="text" required />
      </label>
    </p>
    <div>
      <input type="submit" id="normal-close" value="Normal close" />
      <input
        type="submit"
        id="novalidate-close"
        value="Novalidate close"
        formnovalidate />
      <input type="submit" id="js-close" value="JS close" />
    </div>
  </form>
</dialog>
<p>
  <button id="show-dialog">Show the dialog</button>
</p>
<output></output>
```

```css hidden
[type="submit"] {
  margin-right: 1rem;
}
```

#### JavaScript

```js
const showBtn = document.getElementById("show-dialog");
const dialog = document.getElementById("dialog");
const jsCloseBtn = dialog.querySelector("#js-close");

showBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  dialog.showModal();
});

jsCloseBtn.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  dialog.close();
});
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Closing a dialog with a required form input", "100%", 300)}}

From the output, we see it is impossible to close the dialog using the _Normal close_ button. But the dialog can be closed if we bypass the form validation using the `formnovalidate` attribute on the _Cancel_ button. Programmatically, `dialog.close()` will also close such dialog.

### Comparison of different closedby behaviors

This example demonstrates the difference in behavior between different values of the [`closedby`](#closedby) attribute.

#### HTML

We provide three {{htmlelement("button")}} elements and three `<dialog>` elements. Each button will be programmed to open a different dialog that demonstrates the behavior of one of the three values of the `closedby` attribute — `none`, `closerequest`, and `any`. Note that each `<dialog>` element contains a `<button>` element that will be used to close it.

```html live-sample___closedbyvalues
<p>Choose a <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> type to show:</p>
<div id="controls">
  <button id="none-btn"><code>closedby="none"</code></button>
  <button id="closerequest-btn">
    <code>closedby="closerequest"</code>
  </button>
  <button id="any-btn"><code>closedby="any"</code></button>
</div>

<dialog closedby="none">
  <h2><code>closedby="none"</code></h2>
  <p>
    Only closable using a specific provided mechanism, which in this case is
    pressing the "Close" button below.
  </p>
  <button class="close">Close</button>
</dialog>

<dialog closedby="closerequest">
  <h2><code>closedby="closerequest"</code></h2>
  <p>Closable using the "Close" button or the Esc key.</p>
  <button class="close">Close</button>
</dialog>

<dialog closedby="any">
  <h2><code>closedby="any"</code></h2>
  <p>
    Closable using the "Close" button, the Esc key, or by clicking outside the
    dialog. "Light dismiss" behavior.
  </p>
  <button class="close">Close</button>
</dialog>
```

```css hidden live-sample___closedbyvalues
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

#controls {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-around;
}

dialog {
  width: 480px;
  border-radius: 5px;
  border-color: rgb(0 0 0 / 0.3);
}

dialog h2 {
  margin: 0;
}

dialog p {
  line-height: 1.4;
}
```

#### JavaScript

Here we assign different variables to reference the main control `<button>` elements, the `<dialog>` elements, and the "Close" `<button>` elements inside the dialogs. First we assign a [`click`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event) event listener to each control button using [`addEventListener`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener), the event handler function of which opens the associated `<dialog>` element via [`showModal()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDialogElement/showModal). We then loop through the "Close" `<button>` references, assigning each one a `click` event handler function that closes its `<dialog>` element via [`close()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDialogElement/close).

```js live-sample___closedbyvalues
const noneBtn = document.getElementById("none-btn");
const closerequestBtn = document.getElementById("closerequest-btn");
const anyBtn = document.getElementById("any-btn");

const noneDialog = document.querySelector("[closedby='none']");
const closerequestDialog = document.querySelector("[closedby='closerequest']");
const anyDialog = document.querySelector("[closedby='any']");

const closeBtns = document.querySelectorAll(".close");

noneBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  noneDialog.showModal();
});

closerequestBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  closerequestDialog.showModal();
});

anyBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  anyDialog.showModal();
});

closeBtns.forEach((btn) => {
  btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
    btn.parentElement.close();
  });
});
```

#### Result

The rendered result is as follows:

{{EmbedLiveSample("closedby-values", "100%", 300)}}

Try clicking each button to open a dialog. The first one can only be closed by clicking its "Close" button. The second one can also be closed via a device-specific user action such as pressing the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key. The third one has full ["light-dismiss" behavior](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API/Using#auto_state_and_light_dismiss), so it can also be closed by clicking or tapping outside the dialog.

### Animating dialogs

`<dialog>`s are set to [`display: none;`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) when hidden and `display: block;` when shown, as well as being removed from / added to the {{glossary("top layer")}} and the [accessibility tree](/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Guides/How_browsers_work#building_the_accessibility_tree). Therefore, for `<dialog>` elements to be animated the {{cssxref("display")}} property needs to be animatable. [Supporting browsers](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display#browser_compatibility) animate `display` with a variation on the [discrete animation type](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties#discrete). Specifically, the browser will flip between `none` and another value of `display` so that the animated content is shown for the entire animation duration.

So for example:

- When animating `display` from `none` to `block` (or another visible `display` value), the value will flip to `block` at `0%` of the animation duration so it is visible throughout.
- When animating `display` from `block` (or another visible `display` value) to `none`, the value will flip to `none` at `100%` of the animation duration so it is visible throughout.

> [!NOTE]
> When animating using [CSS transitions](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_transitions), [`transition-behavior: allow-discrete`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition-behavior) needs to be set to enable the above behavior. This behavior is available by default when animating with [CSS animations](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animations); an equivalent step is not required.

#### Transitioning dialog elements

When animating `<dialog>`s with CSS transitions, the following features are required:

- [`@starting-style`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@starting-style) at-rule
  - : Provides a set of starting values for properties set on the `<dialog>` that you want to transition from every time it is opened. This is needed to avoid unexpected behavior. By default, CSS transitions only occur when a property changes from one value to another on a visible element; they are not triggered on elements' first style updates, or when the `display` type changes from `none` to another type.
- [`display`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) property
  - : Add `display` to the transitions list so that the `<dialog>` will remain as `display: block` (or another visible `display` value set on the dialog's open state) for the duration of the transition, ensuring the other transitions are visible.
- [`overlay`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overlay) property
  - : Include `overlay` in the transitions list to ensure the removal of the `<dialog>` from the top layer is deferred until the transition completes, again ensuring the transition is visible.
- {{cssxref("transition-behavior")}} property
  - : Set `transition-behavior: allow-discrete` on the `display` and `overlay` transitions (or on the {{cssxref("transition")}} shorthand) to enable discrete transitions on these two properties that are not by default animatable.

Here is a quick example to show what this might look like.

##### HTML

The HTML contains a `<dialog>` element, plus a button to show the dialog. Additionally, the `<dialog>` element contains another button to close itself.

```html
<dialog id="dialog">
  Content here
  <button class="close">close</button>
</dialog>

<button class="show">Show Modal</button>
```

##### CSS

In the CSS, we include a `@starting-style` block that defines the transition starting styles for the `opacity` and `transform` properties, transition end styles on the `dialog:open` state, and default styles on the default `dialog` state to transition back to once the `<dialog>` has appeared. Note how the `<dialog>`'s `transition` list includes not only these properties, but also the `display` and `overlay` properties, each with `allow-discrete` set on them.

We also set a starting style value for the {{cssxref("background-color")}} property on the [`::backdrop`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::backdrop) that appears behind the `<dialog>` when it opens, to provide a nice darkening animation. The `dialog:open::backdrop` selector selects only the backdrops of `<dialog>` elements when the dialog is open.

```css
/* Open state of the dialog  */
dialog:open {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: scaleY(1);
}

/* Closed state of the dialog   */
dialog {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: scaleY(0);
  transition:
    opacity 0.7s ease-out,
    transform 0.7s ease-out,
    overlay 0.7s ease-out allow-discrete,
    display 0.7s ease-out allow-discrete;
  /* Equivalent to
  transition: all 0.7s allow-discrete; */
}

/* Before open state  */
/* Needs to be after the previous dialog:open rule to take effect,
    as the specificity is the same */
@starting-style {
  dialog:open {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: scaleY(0);
  }
}

/* Transition the :backdrop when the dialog modal is promoted to the top layer */
dialog::backdrop {
  background-color: transparent;
  transition:
    display 0.7s allow-discrete,
    overlay 0.7s allow-discrete,
    background-color 0.7s;
  /* Equivalent to
  transition: all 0.7s allow-discrete; */
}

dialog:open::backdrop {
  background-color: rgb(0 0 0 / 25%);
}

/* This starting-style rule cannot be nested inside the above selector
because the nesting selector cannot represent pseudo-elements. */

@starting-style {
  dialog:open::backdrop {
    background-color: transparent;
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> In browsers that don't support the {{cssxref(":open")}} pseudo-class, you can use the attribute selector `dialog[open]` to style the `<dialog>` element when it is in the open state.

##### JavaScript

The JavaScript adds event handlers to the show and close buttons causing them to show and close the `<dialog>` when they are clicked:

```js
const dialogElem = document.getElementById("dialog");
const showBtn = document.querySelector(".show");
const closeBtn = document.querySelector(".close");

showBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  dialogElem.showModal();
});

closeBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  dialogElem.close();
});
```

##### Result

The code renders as follows:

{{ EmbedLiveSample("Transitioning dialog elements", "100%", "200") }}

> [!NOTE]
> Because `<dialog>`s change from `display: none` to `display: block` each time they are shown, the `<dialog>` transitions from its `@starting-style` styles to its `dialog:open` styles every time the entry transition occurs. When the `<dialog>` closes, it transitions from its `dialog:open` state to the default `dialog` state.
>
> It is possible for the style transition on entry and exit to be different in such cases. See our [Demonstration of when starting styles are used](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@starting-style#demonstration_of_when_starting_styles_are_used) example for a proof of this.

#### dialog keyframe animations

When animating a `<dialog>` with CSS keyframe animations, there are some differences to note from transitions:

- You don't provide a `@starting-style`.
- You include the `display` value in a keyframe; this will be the `display` value for the entirety of the animation, or until another non-`none` display value is encountered.
- You don't need to explicitly enable discrete animations; there is no equivalent to `allow-discrete` inside keyframes.
- You don't need to set `overlay` inside keyframes either; the `display` animation handles the animation of the `<dialog>` from shown to hidden.

Let's have a look at an example so you can see what this looks like.

##### HTML

First, the HTML contains a `<dialog>` element, plus a button to show the dialog. Additionally, the `<dialog>` element contains another button to close itself.

```html
<dialog id="dialog">
  Content here
  <button class="close">close</button>
</dialog>

<button class="show">Show Modal</button>
```

##### CSS

The CSS defines keyframes to animate between the closed and shown states of the `<dialog>`, plus the fade-in animation for the `<dialog>`'s backdrop. The `<dialog>` animations include animating `display` to make sure the actual visible animation effects remain visible for the whole duration. Note that it wasn't possible to animate the backdrop fade out — the backdrop is immediately removed from the DOM when the `<dialog>` is closed, so there is nothing to animate.

```css
dialog {
  animation: fade-out 0.7s ease-out;
}

dialog:open {
  animation: fade-in 0.7s ease-out;
}

dialog:open::backdrop {
  background-color: black;
  animation: backdrop-fade-in 0.7s ease-out forwards;
}

/* Animation keyframes */

@keyframes fade-in {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: scaleY(0);
    display: none;
  }

  100% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: scaleY(1);
    display: block;
  }
}

@keyframes fade-out {
  0% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: scaleY(1);
    display: block;
  }

  100% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: scaleY(0);
    display: none;
  }
}

@keyframes backdrop-fade-in {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
  }

  100% {
    opacity: 0.25;
  }
}

body,
button {
  font-family: system-ui;
}
```

##### JavaScript

Finally, the JavaScript adds event handlers to the buttons to enable showing and closing the `<dialog>`:

```js
const dialogElem = document.getElementById("dialog");
const showBtn = document.querySelector(".show");
const closeBtn = document.querySelector(".close");

showBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  dialogElem.showModal();
});

closeBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  dialogElem.close();
});
```

##### Result

The code renders as follows:

{{ EmbedLiveSample("dialog keyframe animations", "100%", "200") }}

# <dir>: The Directory element

{{Deprecated_Header}}

The **`<dir>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used as a container for a directory of files and/or folders, potentially with styles and icons applied by the {{Glossary("user agent")}}. Do not use this obsolete element; instead, you should use the {{HTMLElement("ul")}} element for lists, including lists of files.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not use this element. Though present in early HTML specifications, it has been deprecated in HTML 4, and has since been removed entirely.

## DOM interface

This element implements the {{domxref("HTMLDirectoryElement")}} interface.

## Attributes

Like all other HTML elements, this element supports the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

- `compact` {{Deprecated_Inline}}
  - : This Boolean attribute hints that the list should be rendered in a compact style. The interpretation of this attribute depends on the user agent and it doesn't work in all browsers.

# <div>: The Content Division element

The **`<div>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using {{glossary("CSS")}} (e.g., styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like [Flexbox](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout) is applied to its parent element).

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;div&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<div class="warning">
  <img
    src="/shared-assets/images/examples/leopard.jpg"
    alt="An intimidating leopard." />
  <p>Beware of the leopard</p>
</div>
```

```css interactive-example
.warning {
  border: 10px ridge red;
  background-color: yellow;
  padding: 0.5rem;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.warning img {
  width: 100%;
}

.warning p {
  font: small-caps bold 1.2rem sans-serif;
  text-align: center;
}
```

As a "pure" container, the `<div>` element does not inherently represent anything. Instead, it's used to group content so it can be easily styled using the [`class`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/class) or [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/id) attributes, marking a section of a document as being written in a different language (using the [`lang`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/lang) attribute), and so on.

## Attributes

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

> [!NOTE]
> The `align` attribute is obsolete; do not use it anymore. Instead, you should use CSS properties or techniques such as [CSS Grid](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout) or [CSS Flexbox](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Flexbox) to align and position `<div>` elements on the page.

## Usage notes

- The `<div>` element should be used only when no other semantic element (such as {{HTMLElement("article")}} or {{HTMLElement("nav")}}) is appropriate.

## Accessibility

The `<div>` element has [an implicit role of `generic`](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#generic), and not none. This may affect certain ARIA combination declarations that expect a direct descendant element with a certain role to function properly.

## Examples

### A basic example

```html
<div>
  <p>
    Any kind of content here. Such as &lt;p&gt;, &lt;table&gt;. You name it!
  </p>
</div>
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("A_basic_example", 650, 60)}}

### A styled example

This example creates a shadowed box by applying a style to the `<div>` using CSS. Note the use of the [`class`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/class) attribute on the `<div>` to apply the style named `"shadowbox"` to the element.

#### HTML

```html
<div class="shadowbox">
  <p>Here's a very interesting note displayed in a lovely shadowed box.</p>
</div>
```

#### CSS

```css

# <dl>: The Description List element

The **`<dl>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a description list. The element encloses a list of groups of terms (specified using the {{HTMLElement("dt")}} element) and descriptions (provided by {{HTMLElement("dd")}} elements). Common uses for this element are to implement a glossary or to display metadata (a list of key-value pairs).

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;dl&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<p>Cryptids of Cornwall:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Beast of Bodmin</dt>
  <dd>A large feline inhabiting Bodmin Moor.</dd>

  <dt>Morgawr</dt>
  <dd>A sea serpent.</dd>

  <dt>Owlman</dt>
  <dd>A giant owl-like creature.</dd>
</dl>
```

```css interactive-example
p,
dt {
  font-weight: bold;
}

dl,
dd {
  font-size: 0.9rem;
}

dd {
  margin-bottom: 1em;
}
```

## Attributes

This element also accepts the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

- `compact` {{Deprecated_inline}}
  - : This Boolean attribute hints that the list should be rendered in a compact style. The interpretation of this attribute is browser-specific. Use [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) instead: to give a similar effect as the `compact` attribute, the CSS property {{cssxref("line-height")}} can be used with a value of `80%`.

## Accessibility

Each screen reader exposes `<dl>` content differently, including total count, terms/definitions context, and navigation methods. These differences are not necessarily bugs.
As of iOS 14, VoiceOver will announce that `<dl>` content is a list when navigating with the virtual cursor (not via the read-all command). VoiceOver does not support list navigation commands with `<dl>`. Be careful applying ARIA `term` and `definition` roles to `<dl>` constructs as VoiceOver (macOS and iOS) will adjust how they are announced.

- [Brief Note on Description List Support](https://adrianroselli.com/2022/12/brief-note-on-description-list-support.html)

## Examples

### Single term and description

```html
<dl>
  <dt>Firefox</dt>
  <dd>
    A free, open source, cross-platform, graphical web browser developed by the
    Mozilla Corporation and hundreds of volunteers.
  </dd>

  <!-- Other terms and descriptions -->
</dl>
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Single_term_and_description")}}

### Multiple terms, single description

```html
<dl>
  <dt>Firefox</dt>
  <dt>Mozilla Firefox</dt>
  <dt>Fx</dt>
  <dd>
    A free, open source, cross-platform, graphical web browser developed by the
    Mozilla Corporation and hundreds of volunteers.
  </dd>

  </dd>
  <dd>
    The Red Panda also known as the Lesser Panda, Wah, Bear Cat or Firefox, is a
    mostly herbivorous mammal, slightly larger than a domestic cat (60 cm long).
  </dd>

  <!-- Other terms and descriptions -->
</dl>
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Single_term_multiple_descriptions")}}

### Multiple terms and descriptions

It is also possible to define multiple terms with multiple corresponding descriptions, by combining the examples above.

### Metadata

Description lists are useful for displaying metadata as a list of key-value pairs.

```html
<dl>
  <dt>Name</dt>
  <dd>Godzilla</dd>
  <dt>Born</dt>
  <dd>1952</dd>
  <dt>Birthplace</dt>
  <dd>Japan</dd>
  <dt>Color</dt>
  <dd>Green</dd>
</dl>
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample('Metadata')}}

Tip: It can be handy to define a key-value separator in the CSS, such as:

```css
dt::after {
  content: ": ";
}
```

### Wrapping name-value groups in `div` elements

HTML allows wrapping each name-value group in a `<dl>` element in a {{HTMLElement("div")}} element. This can be useful when using [microdata](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Microdata), or when [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes) apply to a whole group, or for styling purposes.

```html
<dl>
  <div>
    <dt>Name</dt>
    <dd>Godzilla</dd>
  </div>
  <div>
    <dt>Born</dt>
    <dd>1952</dd>
  </div>
  <div>
    <dt>Birthplace</dt>
    <dd>Japan</dd>
  </div>
  <div>
    <dt>Color</dt>
    <dd>Green</dd>
  </div>
</dl>
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample('Wrapping name-value groups in `div` elements')}}

## Notes

Do not use this element (nor {{HTMLElement("ul")}} elements) to merely create indentation on a page. Although it works, this is a bad practice and obscures the meaning of description lists.

To change the indentation of a description term, use the [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) {{cssxref("margin")}} property.

# <dt>: The Description Term element

The **`<dt>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element specifies a term in a description or definition list, and as such must be used inside a {{HTMLElement("dl")}} element. It is usually followed by a {{HTMLElement("dd")}} element; however, multiple `<dt>` elements in a row indicate several terms that are all defined by the immediate next {{HTMLElement("dd")}} element.

The subsequent {{HTMLElement("dd")}} (**Description Details**) element provides the definition or other related text associated with the term specified using `<dt>`.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;dt&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<p>Please use the following paint colors for the new house:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Denim (semigloss finish)</dt>
  <dd>Ceiling</dd>

  <dt>Denim (eggshell finish)</dt>

# <em>: The Emphasis element

The **`<em>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element marks text that has stress emphasis. The `<em>` element can be nested, with each level of nesting indicating a greater degree of emphasis.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;em&gt;", "tabbed-shorter")}}

```html interactive-example
<p>Get out of bed <em>now</em>!</p>

<p>We <em>had</em> to do something about it.</p>

<p>This is <em>not</em> a drill!</p>
```

```css interactive-example
em {
  /* Add your styles here */
}
```

## Attributes

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

## Usage notes

The `<em>` element is for words that have a stressed emphasis compared to surrounding text, which is often limited to a word or words of a sentence and affects the meaning of the sentence itself.

Typically this element is displayed in italic type. However, it should not be used to apply italic styling; use the CSS {{cssxref("font-style")}} property for that purpose. Use the {{HTMLElement("cite")}} element to mark the title of a work (book, play, song, etc.). Use the {{HTMLElement("i")}} element to mark text that is in an alternate tone or mood, which covers many common situations for italics such as scientific names or words in other languages. Use the {{HTMLElement("strong")}} element to mark text that has greater importance than surrounding text.

### \<i> vs. \<em>

Some developers may be confused by how multiple elements seemingly produce similar visual results. `<em>` and `<i>` are a common example, since they both italicize text. What's the difference? Which should you use?

By default, the visual result is the same. However, the semantic meaning is different. The `<em>` element represents stress emphasis of its contents, while the `<i>` element represents text that is set off from the normal prose, such as a foreign word, fictional character thoughts, or when the text refers to the definition of a word instead of representing its semantic meaning. (The title of a work, such as the name of a book or movie, should use `<cite>`.)

This means the right one to use depends on the situation. Neither is for purely decorative purposes, that's what CSS styling is for.

Examples for `<em>` could be:

```html live-sample___em-example
<p>Just <em>do</em> it already!</p>
<p>We <em>had</em> to do something about it.</p>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('em-example', "", 85)}}

A person or software reading the text would pronounce the words in italics with an emphasis, using verbal stress.

Examples for `<i>` could be:

```html live-sample___i-example
<p>The word <i>the</i> is an article.</p>
<p>The <i>Queen Mary</i> sailed last night.</p>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('i-example', "", 85)}}

Here, there is no added emphasis or importance on the word "Queen Mary". It is merely indicated that the object in question is not a queen named Mary but a ship named "Queen Mary".

## Examples

In this example, the `<em>` element is used to highlight an implicit or explicit contrast between two ingredient lists:

```html
<p>
  Ice cream is made with milk, sweetener, and cream. Frozen custard, on the
  other hand, is made of milk, cream, sweetener, and <em>egg yolks</em>.
</p>
```

# <embed>: The Embed External Content element

The **`<embed>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element embeds external content at the specified point in the document. This content is provided by an external application or other source of interactive content such as a browser plug-in.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;embed&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<embed
  type="image/jpeg"
  src="/shared-assets/images/examples/flowers.jpg"
  width="250"
  height="200" />
```

> [!NOTE]
> This topic documents only the element that is defined as part of the [HTML Living Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/iframe-embed-object.html#the-embed-element). It does not address earlier, non-standardized implementation of the element.

Keep in mind that most modern browsers have deprecated and removed support for browser plug-ins, so relying upon `<embed>` is generally not wise if you want your site to be operable on the average user's browser.

## Attributes

This element's attributes include the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

- `height`
  - : The displayed height of the resource, in [CSS pixels](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values/#px). This must be an absolute value; percentages are _not_ allowed.
- `src`
  - : The URL of the resource being embedded.
- `type`
  - : The {{glossary("MIME type")}} to use to select the plug-in to instantiate.
- `width`
  - : The displayed width of the resource, in [CSS pixels](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values/#px). This must be an absolute value; percentages are _not_ allowed.

## Usage notes

You can use the {{cssxref("object-position")}} property to adjust the positioning of the embedded object within the element's frame.

> [!NOTE]
> The {{cssxref("object-fit")}} property has no effect on `<embed>` elements.

## Accessibility

Use the [`title` attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/title) on an `embed` element to label its content so that people navigating with assistive technology such as a screen reader can understand what it contains. The title's value should concisely describe the embedded content. Without a title, they may not be able to determine what its embedded content is. This context shift can be confusing and time-consuming, especially if the `embed` element contains interactive content like video or audio.

## Examples

```html
<embed
  type="video/quicktime"
  src="movie.mov"
  width="640"
  height="480"
  title="Title of my video" />
```

# <fencedframe>: The Fenced Frame element

{{SeeCompatTable}}

The **`<fencedframe>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a nested {{Glossary("browsing context")}}, embedding another HTML page into the current one. `<fencedframe>`s are very similar to {{htmlelement("iframe")}} elements in form and function, except that:

- Communication is restricted between the `<fencedframe>` content and its embedding site.
- A `<fencedframe>` can access cross-site data, but only in a very specific set of controlled circumstances that preserve user privacy.
- A `<fencedframe>` cannot be manipulated or have its data accessed via regular scripting (for example reading or setting the source URL). `<fencedframe>` content can only be embedded via [specific APIs](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fenced_frame_API#use_cases).
- A `<fencedframe>` cannot access the embedding context's DOM, nor can the embedding context access the `<fencedframe>`'s DOM.

The `<fencedframe>` element is a type of `<iframe>` with more native privacy features built in. It addresses shortcomings of `<iframe>`s such as reliance on third-party cookies and other privacy risks. See [Fenced frame API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fenced_frame_API) for more details.

## Attributes

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

- `allow` {{experimental_inline}}
  - : Specifies a [Permissions Policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Permissions_Policy) for the `<fencedframe>`, which defines what features are available to the `<fencedframe>` based on the origin of the request. See [Permissions policies available to fenced frames](#permissions_policies_available_to_fenced_frames) for more details of which features can be controlled via a policy set on a fenced frame.

- `height` {{experimental_inline}}
  - : A unitless integer representing the height of the fenced frame in CSS pixels. The default is `150`.

- `width` {{experimental_inline}}
  - : A unitless integer representing the width of the fenced frame in CSS pixels. The default is `300`.

## Permissions policies available to fenced frames

Permissions delegated from the top-level context to a fenced frame for allowing and denying features could be used as a communication channel, so constitute a privacy threat. As a result, standard web features that can have their availability controlled via [Permissions Policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Permissions-Policy) (for example, [`camera`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Permissions-Policy/camera) or [`geolocation`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Permissions-Policy/geolocation)) are **not available** within fenced frames.

The only features that can be enabled by a policy inside fenced frames are the specific features designed to be used inside fenced frames:

- [Protected Audience API](https://privacysandbox.google.com/private-advertising/protected-audience)
  - `attribution-reporting`
  - `private-aggregation`
  - `shared-storage`
  - `shared-storage-select-url`
- [Shared Storage API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Shared_Storage_API)
  - `attribution-reporting`
  - `private-aggregation`
  - `shared-storage`
  - `shared-storage-select-url`

Currently these are always enabled inside fenced frames. In the future, which ones are enabled will be controllable using the `<fencedframe>` `allow` attribute. Blocking privacy sandbox features in this manner will also block the fenced frame from loading — there will be no communication channel at all.

## Focusing across fenced frame boundaries

The ability of the document's active focus to be moved across fenced frame boundaries (i.e., from an element outside the fenced frame to one inside, or vice versa) is limited. User-initiated actions such as a click or a tab can do so, as there is no fingerprinting risk there.

However, trying to traverse the boundary via an API call such as {{domxref("HTMLElement.focus()")}} is prohibited — a malicious script could use a series of such calls to leak inferred information across the boundary.

## Positioning and scaling

Being a {{ glossary("replaced elements", "replaced element")}}, the `<fencedframe>` allows the position of the embedded document within its box to be adjusted using the {{cssxref("object-position")}} property.

> [!NOTE]
> The {{cssxref("object-fit")}} property has no effect on `<fencedframe>` elements.

The size of the embedded content may be set by internal `contentWidth` and `contentHeight` properties of the `<fencedframe>`'s {{domxref("HTMLFencedFrameElement.config", "config")}} object. In such cases, changing the `width` or `height` of the `<fencedframe>` will change the size of the embedded container on the page, but the document inside the container will be visually scaled to fit. The reported width and height of the embedded document (i.e., {{domxref("Window.innerWidth")}} and {{domxref("Window.innerHeight")}}) will be unchanged.

## Accessibility

People navigating with assistive technology, such as a screen reader, can use the [`title` attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/title) on a `<fencedframe>` to label its content. The title's value should concisely describe the embedded content:

```html
<fencedframe
  title="Advertisement for new Log. From Blammo!"
  width="640"
  height="320"></fencedframe>
```

Without this title, they have to navigate into the `<fencedframe>` to determine what its embedded content is. This context shift can be confusing and time-consuming, especially for pages with multiple `<fencedframe>`s and/or if embeds contain interactive content like video or audio.

## Examples

To set what content will be shown in a `<fencedframe>`, a utilizing API (such as [Protected Audience](https://privacysandbox.google.com/private-advertising/protected-audience) or [Shared Storage](https://privacysandbox.google.com/private-advertising/shared-storage)) generates a {{domxref("FencedFrameConfig")}} object, which is then set as the value of the `<fencedframe>`'s `config` property.

The following example gets a `FencedFrameConfig` from a Protected Audience API's ad auction, which is then used to display the winning ad in a `<fencedframe>`:

```html
<fencedframe width="640" height="320"></fencedframe>
```

```js
const frameConfig = await navigator.runAdAuction({
  // … auction configuration
  resolveToConfig: true,
});

const frame = document.querySelector("fencedframe");
frame.config = frameConfig;
```

> [!NOTE]
> `resolveToConfig: true` must be passed in to the `runAdAuction()` call to obtain a `FencedFrameConfig` object. If it is not set, the resulting {{jsxref("Promise")}} will resolve to a URN that can only be used in an {{htmlelement("iframe")}}.

# <fieldset>: The Field Set element

The **`<fieldset>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used to group several controls as well as labels ({{HTMLElement("label")}}) within a web form.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;fieldset&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<form>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Choose your favorite monster</legend>

    <input type="radio" id="kraken" name="monster" value="K" />
    <label for="kraken">Kraken</label><br />

    <input type="radio" id="sasquatch" name="monster" value="S" />
    <label for="sasquatch">Sasquatch</label><br />

    <input type="radio" id="mothman" name="monster" value="M" />
    <label for="mothman">Mothman</label>
  </fieldset>
</form>
```

```css interactive-example
legend {
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
  padding: 3px 6px;
}

input {
  margin: 0.4rem;
}
```

As the example above shows, the `<fieldset>` element provides a grouping for a part of an HTML form, with a nested {{htmlelement("legend")}} element providing a caption for the `<fieldset>`. It takes few attributes, the most notable of which are `form`, which can contain the `id` of a {{htmlelement("form")}} on the same page, allowing you to make the `<fieldset>` part of that `<form>` even if it is not nested inside it, and `disabled`, which allows you to disable the `<fieldset>` and all its contents in one go.

## Attributes

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

- [`disabled`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/disabled)
  - : If this Boolean attribute is set, all form controls that are descendants of the `<fieldset>`, are disabled, meaning they are not editable and won't be submitted along with the {{htmlelement("form")}}. They won't receive any browsing events, like mouse clicks or focus-related events. By default browsers display such controls grayed out. Note that form elements inside the {{HTMLElement("legend")}} element won't be disabled.
- [`form`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/form)
  - : This attribute takes the value of the [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/id) attribute of a {{HTMLElement("form")}} element you want the `<fieldset>` to be part of, even if it is not inside the form. Please note that usage of this is confusing — if you want the {{HTMLElement("input")}} elements inside the `<fieldset>` to be associated with the form, you need to use the `form` attribute directly on those elements. You can check which elements are associated with a form via JavaScript, using {{domxref("HTMLFormElement.elements")}}.
- `name`
  - : The name associated with the group.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The caption for the fieldset is given by the first {{HTMLElement("legend")}} element nested inside it.

## Styling with CSS

There are several special styling considerations for `<fieldset>`.

Its {{cssxref("display")}} value is `block` by default, and it establishes a [block formatting context](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Block_formatting_context). If the `<fieldset>` is styled with an inline-level `display` value, it will behave as `inline-block`, otherwise it will behave as `block`. By default there is a `2px` `groove` border surrounding the contents, and a small amount of default padding. The element has {{cssxref("min-inline-size", "min-inline-size: min-content")}} by default.

If a {{htmlelement("legend")}} is present, it is placed over the `block-start` border. The `<legend>` shrink-wraps, and also establishes a formatting context. The `display` value is blockified. (For example, `display: inline` behaves as `block`.)

There will be an anonymous box holding the contents of the `<fieldset>`, which inherits certain properties from the `<fieldset>`. If the `<fieldset>` is styled with `display: grid` or `display: inline-grid`, then the anonymous box will be a grid formatting context. If the `<fieldset>` is styled with `display: flex` or `display: inline-flex`, then the anonymous box will be a flex formatting context. Otherwise, it establishes a block formatting context.

You can feel free to style the `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` in any way you want to suit your page design.

## Examples

### Basic fieldset

This example includes a `<fieldset>` with a `<legend>`, with a single control inside it.

```html
<form action="#">
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Do you agree?</legend>
    <input type="checkbox" id="chbx" name="agree" value="Yes!" />
    <label for="chbx">I agree</label>
  </fieldset>
</form>
```

#### Result

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Basic_fieldset', '100%', '80') }}

### Disabled fieldset

This example shows a disabled `<fieldset>` with two controls inside it. Note how both the controls are disabled due to being inside a disabled `<fieldset>`.

```html
<form action="#">
  <fieldset disabled>
    <legend>Disabled login fieldset</legend>
    <div>
      <label for="name">Name: </label>
      <input type="text" id="name" value="Chris" />
    </div>
    <div>
      <label for="pwd">Archetype: </label>
      <input type="password" id="pwd" value="Wookie" />
    </div>
  </fieldset>
</form>
```

#### Result

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Disabled_fieldset', '100%', '110') }}

# <figure>: The Figure with Optional Caption element

The **`<figure>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents self-contained content, potentially with an optional caption, which is specified using the {{HTMLElement("figcaption")}} element. The figure, its caption, and its contents are referenced as a single unit.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;figure&gt;", "tabbed-shorter")}}

```html interactive-example
<figure>
  <img
    src="/shared-assets/images/examples/elephant.jpg"

  padding: 3px;
  text-align: center;
}
```

## Attributes

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

## Usage notes

- Usually a `<figure>` is an image, illustration, diagram, code snippet, etc., that is referenced in the main flow of a document, but that can be moved to another part of the document or to an appendix without affecting the main flow.
- A caption can be associated with the `<figure>` element by inserting a {{HTMLElement("figcaption")}} inside it (as the first or the last child). The first `<figcaption>` element found in the figure is presented as the figure's caption.
- The `<figcaption>` provides the {{glossary("accessible name")}} for the parent `<figure>`.

## Examples

### Images

```html
<!-- Just an image -->
<figure>
  <img src="favicon-192x192.png" alt="The beautiful MDN logo." />
</figure>

<!-- Image with a caption -->
<figure>
  <img src="favicon-192x192.png" alt="The beautiful MDN logo." />

# <font>

{{Deprecated_Header}}

The **`<font>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element defines the font size, color and face for its content.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not use this element. Use the CSS [Fonts](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_fonts) properties to style text.

## Attributes

Like all other HTML elements, this element supports the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

- `color` {{Deprecated_Inline}}
  - : This attribute sets the text color using either a named color or a color specified in the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format.
- `face` {{Deprecated_Inline}}
  - : This attribute contains a comma-separated list of one or more font names. The document text in the default style is rendered in the first font face that the client's browser supports. If no font listed is installed on the local system, the browser typically defaults to the proportional or fixed-width font for that system.
- `size` {{Deprecated_Inline}}
  - : This attribute specifies the font size as either a numeric or relative value. Numeric values range from `1` to `7` with `1` being the smallest and `3` the default. It can be defined using a relative value, like `+2` or `-3`, which sets it relative to `3`, the default value.

## DOM interface

This element implements the {{domxref("HTMLFontElement")}} interface.

# <footer>: The Footer element

The **`<footer>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a footer for its nearest ancestor [sectioning content](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Content_categories#sectioning_content) or [sectioning root](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/Heading_Elements#labeling_section_content) element. A `<footer>` typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;footer&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<article>
  <h1>How to be a wizard</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Grow a long, majestic beard.</li>
    <li>Wear a tall, pointed hat.</li>
    <li>Have I mentioned the beard?</li>
  </ol>
  <footer>
    <p>© 2018 Gandalf</p>
  </footer>
</article>
```

```css interactive-example
article {
  min-height: 100%;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
}

footer {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  padding: 5px;
  background-color: #45a1ff;
  color: white;
}
```

## Attributes

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

## Usage notes

- Enclose information about the author in an {{HTMLElement("address")}} element that can be included into the `<footer>` element.
- When the nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element is the body element the footer applies to the whole page.
- The `<footer>` element is not sectioning content and therefore doesn't introduce a new section in the [outline](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/Heading_Elements).

## Accessibility

Prior to the release of Safari 13, the `contentinfo` [landmark role](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/WAI-ARIA_basics#signpostslandmarks) was not properly exposed by [VoiceOver](https://help.apple.com/voiceover/info/guide/). If needing to support legacy Safari browsers, add `role="contentinfo"` to the `footer` element to ensure the landmark will be properly exposed.

- Related: [WebKit Bugzilla: 146930 – AX: HTML native elements (header, footer, main, aside, nav) should work the same as ARIA landmarks, sometimes they don't](https://webkit.org/b/146930)

# <form>: The Form element

The **`<form>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a document section containing interactive controls for submitting information.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;form&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<form action="" method="get" class="form-example">
  <div class="form-example">
    <label for="name">Enter your name: </label>
    <input type="text" name="name" id="name" required />
  </div>
  <div class="form-example">
    <label for="email">Enter your email: </label>

  </div>
  <div class="form-example">
    <input type="submit" value="Subscribe!" />
  </div>
</form>
```

```css interactive-example
form.form-example {
  display: table;
}

div.form-example {
  display: table-row;
}

label,
input {
  display: table-cell;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

label {
  padding-right: 10px;
}
```

It is possible to use the {{cssxref(':valid')}} and {{cssxref(':invalid')}} CSS [pseudo-classes](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) to style a `<form>` element based on whether the {{domxref("HTMLFormElement.elements", "elements")}} inside the form are valid.

## Attributes

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

- `accept` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : Comma-separated [content types](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Guides/Content_type) the server accepts.

    > [!NOTE]
    > **This attribute has been deprecated and should not be used.** Instead, use the [`accept`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#accept) attribute on `<input type=file>` elements.

- `accept-charset`
  - : The {{Glossary("character encoding")}} accepted by the server.
    The specification allows a single case-insensitive value of `"UTF-8"`, reflecting the ubiquity of this encoding (historically multiple character encodings could be specified as a comma-separated or space-separated list).

- `autocapitalize`
  - : Controls whether inputted text is automatically capitalized and, if so, in what manner. See the [`autocapitalize`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/autocapitalize) global attribute page for more information.

- [`autocomplete`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/autocomplete)
  - : Indicates whether input elements can by default have their values automatically completed by the browser. `autocomplete` attributes on form elements override it on `<form>`. Possible values:
    - `off`: The browser may not automatically complete entries. (Browsers tend to ignore this for suspected login forms; see [Managing autofill for login fields](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Practical_implementation_guides/Turning_off_form_autocompletion#managing_autofill_for_login_fields).)
    - `on`: The browser may automatically complete entries.

- `name`
  - : The name of the form. The value must not be the empty string, and must be unique among the `form` elements in the forms collection that it is in, if any. The name becomes a property of the {{domxref("Window")}}, {{domxref("Document")}}, and {{domxref("document.forms")}} objects, containing a reference to the form element.

- [`rel`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel)
  - : Controls the annotations and what kinds of links the form creates. Annotations include [`external`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel#external), [`nofollow`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel#nofollow), [`opener`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel#opener), [`noopener`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel#noopener), and [`noreferrer`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel#noreferrer). Link types include [`help`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel#help), [`prev`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel#prev), [`next`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel#next), [`search`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel#search), and [`license`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel#license). The [`rel`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel) value is a space-separated list of these enumerated values.

### Attributes for form submission

The following attributes control behavior during form submission.

- `action`
  - : The URL that processes the form submission. This value can be overridden by a [`formaction`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/button#formaction) attribute on a {{HTMLElement("button")}}, [`<input type="submit">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/submit), or [`<input type="image">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/image) element. This attribute is ignored when `method="dialog"` is set.
- `enctype`
  - : If the value of the `method` attribute is `post`, `enctype` is the [MIME type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mime_type) of the form submission. Possible values:
    - `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`: The default value.
    - `multipart/form-data`: Use this if the form contains {{HTMLElement("input")}} elements with `type=file`.
    - `text/plain`: Useful for debugging purposes.

    This value can be overridden by [`formenctype`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/button#formenctype) attributes on {{HTMLElement("button")}}, [`<input type="submit">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/submit), or [`<input type="image">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/image) elements.

- `method`
  - : The [HTTP](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) method to submit the form with.
    The only allowed methods/values are (case insensitive):
    - `post`: The {{HTTPMethod("POST")}} method; form data sent as the [request body](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/body).
    - `get` (default): The {{HTTPMethod("GET")}}; form data appended to the `action` URL with a `?` separator. Use this method when the form [has no side effects](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Idempotent).
    - `dialog`: When the form is inside a {{HTMLElement("dialog")}}, closes the dialog and causes a `submit` event to be fired on submission, without submitting data or clearing the form.

    This value is overridden by [`formmethod`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/button#formmethod) attributes on {{HTMLElement("button")}}, [`<input type="submit">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/submit), or [`<input type="image">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/image) elements.

- `novalidate`
  - : This Boolean attribute indicates that the form shouldn't be validated when submitted. If this attribute is not set (and therefore the form **_is_** validated), it can be overridden by a [`formnovalidate`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/button#formnovalidate) attribute on a {{HTMLElement("button")}}, [`<input type="submit">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/submit), or [`<input type="image">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/image) element belonging to the form.
- `target`
  - : Indicates where to display the response after submitting the form. It is a name/keyword for a _browsing context_ (for example, tab, window, or iframe). The following keywords have special meanings:
    - `_self` (default): Load into the same browsing context as the current one.
    - `_blank`: Load into a new unnamed browsing context. This provides the same behavior as setting [`rel="noopener"`](#rel) which does not set [`window.opener`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/opener).
    - `_parent`: Load into the parent browsing context of the current one. If no parent, behaves the same as `_self`.
    - `_top`: Load into the top-level browsing context (i.e., the browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one and has no parent). If no parent, behaves the same as `_self`.
    - `_unfencedTop`: Load the response from a form inside an embedded [fenced frame](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fenced_frame_API) into the top-level frame (i.e., traversing beyond the root of the fenced frame, unlike other reserved destinations). Only available inside fenced frames.

    This value can be overridden by a [`formtarget`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/button#formtarget) attribute on a {{HTMLElement("button")}}, [`<input type="submit">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/submit), or [`<input type="image">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/image) element.

## Examples

```html
<!-- Form which will send a GET request to the current URL -->
<form method="get">
  <label>
    Name:
    <input name="submitted-name" autocomplete="name" />
  </label>
  <button>Save</button>
</form>

<!-- Form which will send a POST request to the current URL -->
<form method="post">
  <label>
    Name:
    <input name="submitted-name" autocomplete="name" />
  </label>
  <button>Save</button>
</form>

<!-- Form with fieldset, legend, and label -->
<form method="post">
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Do you agree to the terms?</legend>
    <label><input type="radio" name="radio" value="yes" /> Yes</label>
    <label><input type="radio" name="radio" value="no" /> No</label>
  </fieldset>
</form>
```

# <frame>

{{Deprecated_Header}}

The **`<frame>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element defines a particular area in which another HTML document can be displayed. A frame should be used within a {{HTMLElement("frameset")}}.

Using the `<frame>` element is not encouraged because of certain disadvantages such as performance problems and lack of accessibility for users with screen readers. Instead of the `<frame>` element, {{HTMLElement("iframe")}} may be preferred.

## Attributes

Like all other HTML elements, this element supports the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

- `src` {{Deprecated_Inline}}
  - : This attribute specifies the document that will be displayed by the frame.
- `name` {{Deprecated_Inline}}
  - : This attribute is used for labeling frames. Without labeling, every link will open in the frame that it's in – the closest parent frame. See the [`target`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/a#target) attribute for more information.
- `noresize` {{Deprecated_Inline}}
  - : This attribute prevents resizing of frames by users.
- `scrolling` {{Deprecated_Inline}}
  - : This attribute defines the existence of a scrollbar. If this attribute is not used, the browser adds a scrollbar when necessary. There are two choices: "yes" for forcing a scrollbar even when it is not necessary and "no" for forcing no scrollbar even when it _is_ necessary.
- `marginheight` {{Deprecated_Inline}}
  - : This attribute defines the height of the margin between frames.
- `marginwidth` {{Deprecated_Inline}}
  - : This attribute defines the width of the margin between frames.
- `frameborder` {{Deprecated_Inline}}
  - : This attribute allows you to specify a frame's border.

## Example

### A frameset document

A frameset document has a {{HTMLElement("frameset")}} element instead of a {{HTMLElement("body")}} element. The `<frame>` elements are placed within the `<frameset>`.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <!-- Document metadata goes here -->
  </head>
  <frameset cols="400, 500">
    <frame src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/iframe" />
    <frame src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/frame" />
  </frameset>
</html>
```

If you want to embed another HTML page into the {{HTMLElement("body")}} of a document, use an {{HTMLElement("iframe")}} element.

The **`<frameset>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used to contain {{HTMLElement("frame")}} elements.

> [!NOTE]
> Because the use of frames is now discouraged in favor of using {{HTMLElement("iframe")}}, this element is not typically used by modern websites.

## Attributes

Like all other HTML elements, this element supports the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

- `cols` {{Deprecated_Inline}}
  - : This attribute specifies the number and size of horizontal spaces in a frameset.

# <head>: The Document Metadata (Header) element

The **`<head>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element contains machine-readable information ({{glossary("metadata")}}) about the document, like its [title](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/title), [scripts](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/script), and [style sheets](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/style). There can be only one `<head>` element in an HTML document.

> [!NOTE]
> `<head>` primarily holds information for machine processing, not human-readability. For human-visible information, like top-level headings and listed authors, see the {{HTMLElement("header")}} element.

## Attributes

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

- `profile` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : The {{glossary("URI")}}s of one or more metadata profiles, separated by {{Glossary("whitespace", "white space")}}.

## Examples

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>Document title</title>
  </head>

# <header>: The Header element

The **`<header>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;header&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<header>
  <a class="logo" href="#">Cute Puppies Express!</a>
</header>

<article>
  <header>
    <h1>Beagles</h1>
    <time>08.12.2014</time>
  </header>
  <p>
    I love beagles <em>so</em> much! Like, really, a lot. They’re adorable and
    their ears are so, so snugly soft!
  </p>
</article>
```

```css interactive-example
.logo {
  background: left / cover
    url("/shared-assets/images/examples/puppy-header.jpg");
  display: flex;
  height: 120px;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  font:
    bold calc(1em + 2 * (100vw - 120px) / 100) "Dancing Script",
    fantasy;
  color: #ff0083;
  text-shadow: black 2px 2px 0.2rem;
}

header > h1 {
  margin-bottom: 0;
}

header > time {
  font: italic 0.7rem sans-serif;
}
```

## Usage notes

When not nested within [sectioning content](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Content_categories#sectioning_content), {{htmlelement("main")}}, or an element with the same ARIA role as these elements' implicit ARIA role, then the `<header>` element has an identical meaning to the site-wide [`banner`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/banner_role) landmark role. It define a global site header, which usually includes a logo, company name, search feature, and possibly the global navigation or a slogan. It is generally located at the top of the page.

Otherwise, when nested within said elements, it loses its landmark status and represents a group of introductory or navigational aids for the surrounding section. It usually contains the surrounding section's heading (an `h1` – `h6` element) and optional subheading, but this is **not** required.

### Historical Usage

The `<header>` element originally existed at the very beginning of HTML for headings. It is seen in [the very first website](https://info.cern.ch/). At some point, headings became [`<h1>` through `<h6>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/Heading_Elements), allowing `<header>` to be free to fill a different role.

## Attributes

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

## Accessibility

The `<header>` element defines a [`banner`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/banner_role) landmark when its context is the {{HTMLElement('body')}} element.

When placed inside an {{HTMLElement('article')}}, {{HTMLElement('main')}}, {{HTMLElement('section')}}, {{HTMLElement('nav')}}, {{HTMLElement('aside')}}, or an element with the same ARIA role as these elements' implicit ARIA role, the `<header>` element has the [`generic`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/generic_role) role instead, and is no longer considered a landmark. In this case, it cannot be labeled with [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) or [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby).

# <h1>–<h6>: The HTML Section Heading elements

The **`<h1>`** to **`<h6>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) elements represent six levels of section headings. `<h1>` is the highest section level and `<h6>` is the lowest. By default, all heading elements create a [block-level](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Block-level_content) box in the layout, starting on a new line and taking up the full width available in their containing block.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;h1-h6&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<h1>Beetles</h1>
<h2>External morphology</h2>
<h3>Head</h3>
<h4>Mouthparts</h4>
<h3>Thorax</h3>
<h4>Prothorax</h4>
<h4>Pterothorax</h4>
```

```css interactive-example
h1,
h2,
h3,
h4 {
  margin: 0.1rem 0;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 2rem;
}

h2 {
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  padding-left: 20px;
}

h3 {
  font-size: 1.2rem;
  padding-left: 40px;
}

h4 {
  font-size: 1rem;
  font-style: italic;
  padding-left: 60px;
}
```

## Attributes

These elements only include the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

## Usage notes

- Heading information can be used by user agents to construct a table of contents for a document automatically.
- Do not use heading elements to resize text. Instead, use the {{glossary("CSS")}} {{cssxref("font-size")}} property.
- Do not skip heading levels: always start from `<h1>`, followed by `<h2>` and so on.

### Avoid using multiple `<h1>` elements on one page

While using multiple `<h1>` elements on one page is allowed by the HTML standard (as long as they are not [nested](#nesting)), this is not considered a best practice. A page should generally have a single `<h1>` element that describes the content of the page (similar to the document's [`<title>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/title) element).

> [!NOTE]
> Nesting multiple `<h1>` elements in nested [sectioning elements](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements#content_sectioning) was allowed in older versions of the HTML standard. However, this was never considered a best practice and is now non-conforming. Read more in [There Is No Document Outline Algorithm](https://adrianroselli.com/2016/08/there-is-no-document-outline-algorithm.html).

Prefer using only one `<h1>` per page and [nest headings](#nesting) without skipping levels.

### Specifying a uniform font size for `<h1>`

Before May 2025, the [HTML standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/rendering.html#sections-and-headings) specified that `<h1>` elements in a `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, or `<nav>` element should render as an `<h2>` (smaller {{cssxref("font-size")}} with an adjusted {{cssxref("margin-block")}}), or as an `<h3>` if nested another level, and so on. This special context-dependent default style has now been [removed](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/7867).

To ensure consistent `<h1>` rendering for browsers that implement the old context-dependent default style, use the following style rule:

```css
h1 {
  margin-block: 0.67em;
  font-size: 2em;
}
```

Alternatively, to avoid overwriting other style rules that target `<h1>` you can use {{cssxref(":where()")}}, which has zero specificity:

```css
:where(h1) {
  margin-block: 0.67em;
  font-size: 2em;
}
```

## Accessibility

### Navigation

A common navigation technique for users of screen reading software is to quickly jump from heading to heading in order to determine the content of the page. Because of this, it is important to not skip one or more heading levels. Doing so may create confusion, as the person navigating this way may be left wondering where the missing heading is.

**Don't do this:**

```html example-bad
<h1>Heading level 1</h1>
<h3>Heading level 3</h3>
<h4>Heading level 4</h4>
```

**Prefer this:**

```html example-good
<h1>Heading level 1</h1>
<h2>Heading level 2</h2>
<h3>Heading level 3</h3>
```

#### Nesting

Headings may be nested as subsections to reflect the organization of the content of the page. Most screen readers can also generate an ordered list of all the headings on a page, which can help a person quickly determine the content hierarchy and navigate to different headings.

Given the following page structure:

```html
<h1>Beetles</h1>

<h2>Etymology</h2>

<h2>Distribution and Diversity</h2>

<h2>Evolution</h2>
<h3>Late Paleozoic</h3>
<h3>Jurassic</h3>
<h3>Cretaceous</h3>
<h3>Cenozoic</h3>

<h2>External Morphology</h2>
<h3>Head</h3>
<h4>Mouthparts</h4>
<h3>Thorax</h3>
<h4>Prothorax</h4>
<h4>Pterothorax</h4>
<h3>Legs</h3>
<h3>Wings</h3>
<h3>Abdomen</h3>
```

Screen readers would generate a list like this:

1. `h1` Beetles
   1. `h2` Etymology
   2. `h2` Distribution and Diversity
   3. `h2` Evolution
      1. `h3` Late Paleozoic
      2. `h3` Jurassic
      3. `h3` Cretaceous
      4. `h3` Cenozoic

   4. `h2` External Morphology
      1. `h3` Head
         1. `h4` Mouthparts

      2. `h3` Thorax
         1. `h4` Prothorax
         2. `h4` Pterothorax

      3. `h3` Legs
      4. `h3` Wings
      5. `h3` Abdomen

When headings are nested, heading levels may be "skipped" when closing a subsection.

### Labeling section content

Another common navigation technique for users of screen reading software is to generate a list of [sectioning content](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements#content_sectioning) and use it to determine the page's layout.

Sectioning content can be labeled using a combination of the [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) and [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/id) attributes, with the label concisely describing the purpose of the section. This technique is useful for situations where there is more than one sectioning element on the same page.

#### Sectioning content examples

```html
<header>
  <nav aria-labelledby="primary-navigation">
    <h2 id="primary-navigation">Primary navigation</h2>
    <!-- navigation items -->
  </nav>
</header>

<!-- page content -->

<footer>
  <nav aria-labelledby="footer-navigation">
    <h2 id="footer-navigation">Footer navigation</h2>
    <!-- navigation items -->
  </nav>
</footer>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Sectioning_content_examples')}}

In this example, screen reading technology would announce that there are two {{HTMLElement("nav")}} sections, one called "Primary navigation" and one called "Footer navigation". If labels were not provided, the person using screen reading software may have to investigate each `nav` element's contents to determine their purpose.

# <hgroup>: The Heading Group element

The **`<hgroup>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a heading and related content. It groups a single [`<h1>–<h6>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/Heading_Elements) element with one or more [`<p>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/p).

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;hgroup&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<hgroup>
  <h1>Frankenstein</h1>
  <p>Or: The Modern Prometheus</p>
</hgroup>
<p>
  Victor Frankenstein, a Swiss scientist, has a great ambition: to create
  intelligent life. But when his creature first stirs, he realizes he has made a
  monster. A monster which, abandoned by his master and shunned by everyone who
  sees it, follows Dr Frankenstein to the very ends of the earth.
</p>
```

```css interactive-example
hgroup {
  text-align: right;
  padding-right: 16px;
  border-right: 10px solid #00c8d7;
}

hgroup h1 {
  margin-bottom: 0;
}

hgroup p {
  margin: 0;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

## Attributes

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

## Usage notes

The `<hgroup>` element allows the grouping of a heading with any secondary content, such as subheadings, an alternative title, or tagline. Each of these types of content represented as a `<p>` element within the `<hgroup>`.

The `<hgroup>` itself has no impact on the document outline of a web page. Rather, the single allowed heading within the `<hgroup>` contributes to the document outline.

## Examples

```html
<!doctype html>
<title>HTML Standard</title>
<body>
  <hgroup id="document-title">
    <h1>HTML: Living Standard</h1>
    <p>Last Updated 12 July 2022</p>
  </hgroup>
  <p>Some intro to the document.</p>
  <h2>Table of contents</h2>
  <ol id="toc">
    …
  </ol>
  <h2>First section</h2>
  <p>Some intro to the first section.</p>
</body>
```

# <hr>: The Thematic Break (Horizontal Rule) element

The **`<hr>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;hr&gt;", "tabbed-shorter")}}

```html interactive-example
<p>§1: The first rule of Fight Club is: You do not talk about Fight Club.</p>

<hr />

<p>§2: The second rule of Fight Club is: Always bring cupcakes.</p>
```

```css interactive-example
hr {
  border: none;
  border-top: 3px double #333333;
  color: #333333;
  overflow: visible;
  text-align: center;
  height: 5px;
}

hr::after {
  background: white;
  content: "§";
  padding: 0 4px;
  position: relative;
  top: -13px;
}
```

Historically, this has been presented as a horizontal rule or line. While it may still be displayed as a horizontal rule in visual browsers, this element is now defined in semantic terms, rather than presentational terms, so if you wish to draw a horizontal line, you should do so using appropriate CSS.

## Attributes

This element's attributes include the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

- `align` {{deprecated_inline}} {{Non-standard_Inline}}
  - : Sets the alignment of the rule on the page. If no value is specified, the default value is `left`.
- `color` {{deprecated_inline}} {{Non-standard_Inline}}
  - : Sets the color of the rule through color name or hexadecimal value.
- `noshade` {{deprecated_inline}} {{Non-standard_Inline}}
  - : Sets the rule to have no shading.
- `size` {{deprecated_inline}} {{Non-standard_Inline}}
  - : Sets the height, in pixels, of the rule.
- `width` {{deprecated_inline}} {{Non-standard_Inline}}
  - : Sets the length of the rule on the page through a pixel or percentage value.

## Example

### HTML

```html
<p>
  This is the first paragraph of text. This is the first paragraph of text. This
  is the first paragraph of text. This is the first paragraph of text.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
  This is the second paragraph of text. This is the second paragraph of text.
  This is the second paragraph of text. This is the second paragraph of text.

# <html>: The HTML Document / Root element

The **`<html>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the _root element_. All other elements must be descendants of this element. There can be only one `<html>` element in a document.

## Attributes

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

- `version` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : Specifies the version of the HTML {{glossary("Doctype", "Document Type Definition")}} that governs the current document. This attribute is not needed, because it is redundant with the version information in the document type declaration.
- `xmlns`
  - : Specifies the {{glossary("XML")}} {{glossary("Namespace")}} of the document. Default value is `"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"`. This is required in documents parsed with XML {{glossary("parser", "parsers")}}, and optional in text/html documents.

## Accessibility

While HTML does not require authors to specify `<html>` element start and ending tags, it is important for authors to do so as it will allow them to specify the [`lang`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/lang) for the webpage. Providing a `lang` attribute with a valid {{glossary("BCP 47 language tag")}} on the `<html>` element will help screen reading technology determine the proper language to announce. The identifying language tag should describe the language used by the majority of the content of the page. Without it, screen readers will typically default to the operating system's set language, which may cause mispronunciations.

Including a valid `lang` declaration on the `<html>` element also ensures that important metadata contained in the page's {{HTMLElement("head")}}, such as the page's {{HTMLElement("title")}}, are also announced properly.

# <i>: The Idiomatic Text element

The **`<i>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the `<i>` naming of this element.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;i&gt;", "tabbed-shorter")}}

```html interactive-example
<p>I looked at it and thought <i>This can't be real!</i></p>

<p>
  <i>Musa</i> is one of two or three genera in the family <i>Musaceae</i>; it
  includes bananas and plantains.
</p>

<p>
  The term <i>bandwidth</i> describes the measure of how much information can
  pass through a data connection in a given amount of time.
</p>
```

```css interactive-example
i {
  /* Add your styles here */
}
```

## Attributes

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

## Usage notes

- Use the `<i>` element for text that is set off from the normal prose for readability reasons. This would be a range of text with different semantic meaning than the surrounding text. Among the use cases for the `<i>` element are spans of text representing a different quality or mode of text, such as:
  - Alternative voice or mood
  - Taxonomic designations (such as the genus and species "_Homo sapiens_")
  - Idiomatic terms from another language (such as "_et cetera_"); these should include the [`lang`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/lang) attribute to identify the language
  - Technical terms
  - Transliterations
  - Thoughts (such as "She wondered, _What is this writer talking about, anyway?_")
  - Ship or vessel names in Western writing systems (such as "They searched the docks for the _Empress of the Galaxy_, the ship to which they were assigned.")

- In earlier versions of the HTML specification, the `<i>` element was merely a presentational element used to display text in italics, much like the `<b>` element was used to display text in bold letters. This is no longer true, as these tags now define semantics rather than typographic appearance. A browser will typically still display the contents of the `<i>` element in italic type, but is, by definition, no longer required to do so. To display text in italic type, authors should use the CSS {{cssxref("font-style")}} property.
- Be sure the text in question is not actually more appropriately marked up with another element.
  - Use {{HTMLElement("em")}} to indicate stress emphasis.
  - Use {{HTMLElement("strong")}} to indicate importance, seriousness, or urgency.
  - Use {{HTMLElement("mark")}} to indicate relevance.
  - Use {{HTMLElement("cite")}} to mark up the name of a work, such as a book, play, or song.
  - Use {{HTMLElement("dfn")}} to mark up the defining instance of a term.

## Examples

This example demonstrates using the `<i>` element to mark text that is in another language.

```html
<p>
  The Latin phrase <i lang="la">Veni, vidi, vici</i> is often mentioned in
  music, art, and literature.
</p>
```

# <iframe>: The Inline Frame element

The **`<iframe>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a nested {{Glossary("browsing context")}}, embedding another HTML page into the current one.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;iframe&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<iframe
  id="inlineFrameExample"
  title="Inline Frame Example"
  width="300"
  height="200"
  src="https://www.openstreetmap.org/export/embed.html?bbox=-0.004017949104309083%2C51.47612752641776%2C0.00030577182769775396%2C51.478569861898606&amp;layer=mapnik">
</iframe>
```

```css interactive-example
iframe {
  border: 1px solid black;
  width: 100%; /* takes precedence over the width set with the HTML width attribute */
}
```

Each embedded browsing context has its own [document](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document) and allows URL navigations. The navigations of each embedded browsing context are linearized into the [session history](/en-US/docs/Web/API/History) of the _topmost_ browsing context. The browsing context that embeds the others is called the _parent browsing context_. The _topmost_ browsing context — the one with no parent — is usually the browser window, represented by the {{domxref("Window")}} object.

> [!WARNING]
> Because each browsing context is a complete document environment, every `<iframe>` in a page requires increased memory and other computing resources. While theoretically you can use as many `<iframe>`s as you like, check for performance problems.

## Attributes

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

- `allow`
  - : Specifies a [Permissions Policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Permissions_Policy) for the `<iframe>`. The policy defines what features are available to the `<iframe>` (for example, access to the microphone, camera, battery, web-share, etc.) based on the origin of the request.

    See [iframes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Permissions-Policy#iframes) in the `Permissions-Policy` topic for examples.

    > [!NOTE]
    > A Permissions Policy specified by the `allow` attribute implements a further restriction on top of the policy specified in the {{httpheader("Permissions-Policy")}} header. It doesn't replace it.

- `allowfullscreen`
  - : Set to `true` if the `<iframe>` can activate fullscreen mode by calling the {{domxref("Element.requestFullscreen", "requestFullscreen()")}} method.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This attribute is considered a legacy attribute and redefined as `allow="fullscreen"`.

- `allowpaymentrequest` {{deprecated_inline}} {{non-standard_inline}}
  - : Set to `true` if a cross-origin `<iframe>` should be allowed to invoke the [Payment Request API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Payment_Request_API).

    > [!NOTE]
    > This attribute is considered a legacy attribute and redefined as `allow="payment"`.

- `browsingtopics` {{Experimental_Inline}} {{non-standard_inline}}
  - : A boolean attribute that, if present, specifies that the selected topics for the current user should be sent with the request for the `<iframe>`'s source. See [Using the Topics API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Topics_API/Using) for more details.

- `credentialless` {{Experimental_Inline}}
  - : Set to `true` to make the `<iframe>` credentialless, meaning that its content will be loaded in a new, ephemeral context. It doesn't have access to the network, cookies, and storage data associated with its origin. It uses a new context local to the top-level document lifetime. In return, the {{httpheader("Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy")}} (COEP) embedding rules can be lifted, so documents with COEP set can embed third-party documents that do not. See [IFrame credentialless](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/IFrame_credentialless) for more details.

- `csp` {{experimental_inline}}
  - : A [Content Security Policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP) enforced for the embedded resource. See {{domxref("HTMLIFrameElement.csp")}} for details.

- `height`
  - : The height of the frame in CSS pixels. Default is `150`.
- `loading`
  - : Indicates when the browser should load the iframe:
    - `eager`
      - : Load the iframe immediately on page load (this is the default value).
    - `lazy`
      - : Defer loading of the iframe until it reaches a calculated distance from the {{glossary("visual viewport")}}, as defined by the browser.
        The intent is to avoid using the network and storage bandwidth required to fetch the frame until the browser is reasonably certain that it will be needed.
        This improves the performance and cost in most typical use cases, in particular by reducing initial page load times.

        > [!NOTE]
        > Loading is only deferred when JavaScript is enabled.
        > This is an anti-tracking measure.

- `name`
  - : A targetable name for the embedded browsing context. This can be used in the `target` attribute of the {{HTMLElement("a")}}, {{HTMLElement("form")}}, or {{HTMLElement("base")}} elements; the `formtarget` attribute of the {{HTMLElement("input")}} or {{HTMLElement("button")}} elements; or the `windowName` parameter in the {{domxref("Window.open()","window.open()")}} method. In addition, the name becomes a property of the {{domxref("Window")}} and {{domxref("Document")}} objects, containing a reference to the embedded window or the element itself.
- `referrerpolicy`
  - : Indicates which [referrer](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/referrer) to send when fetching the frame's resource:
    - `no-referrer`
      - : The {{HTTPHeader("Referer")}} header will not be sent.
    - `no-referrer-when-downgrade`
      - : The {{HTTPHeader("Referer")}} header will not be sent to {{Glossary("origin")}}s without {{Glossary("TLS")}} ({{Glossary("HTTPS")}}).
    - `origin`
      - : The sent referrer will be limited to the origin of the referring page: its [scheme](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_URL), {{Glossary("host")}}, and {{Glossary("port")}}.
    - `origin-when-cross-origin`
      - : The referrer sent to other origins will be limited to the scheme, the host, and the port. Navigations on the same origin will still include the path.
    - `same-origin`
      - : A referrer will be sent for {{Glossary("Same-origin policy", "same origin")}}, but cross-origin requests will contain no referrer information.
    - `strict-origin`
      - : Only send the origin of the document as the referrer when the protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), but don't send it to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP).
    - `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` (default)
      - : Send a full URL when performing a same-origin request, only send the origin when the protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), and send no header to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP).
    - `unsafe-url`
      - : The referrer will include the origin _and_ the path (but not the [fragment](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement/hash), [password](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement/password), or [username](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement/username)). **This value is unsafe**, because it leaks origins and paths from TLS-protected resources to insecure origins.

- `sandbox`
  - : Controls the restrictions applied to the content embedded in the `<iframe>`. The value of the attribute can either be empty to apply all restrictions, or space-separated tokens to lift particular restrictions:
    - `allow-downloads`
      - : Allows downloading files through an {{HTMLElement("a")}} or {{HTMLElement("area")}} element with the [download](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/a#download) attribute, as well as through the navigation that leads to a download of a file. This works regardless of whether the user clicked on the link, or JS code initiated it without user interaction.
    - `allow-forms`
      - : Allows the page to submit forms. If this keyword is not used, a form will be displayed as normal, but submitting it will not trigger input validation, send data to a web server, or close a dialog.
    - `allow-modals`
      - : Allows the page to open modal windows by {{domxref("Window.alert()")}}, {{domxref("Window.confirm()")}}, {{domxref("Window.print()")}} and {{domxref("Window.prompt()")}}, while opening a {{HTMLElement("dialog")}} is allowed regardless of this keyword. It also allows the page to receive {{domxref("BeforeUnloadEvent")}} event.
    - `allow-orientation-lock`
      - : Lets the resource [lock the screen orientation](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen/lockOrientation).
    - `allow-pointer-lock`
      - : Allows the page to use the [Pointer Lock API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_Lock_API).
    - `allow-popups`
      - : Allows popups (created, for example, by {{domxref("Window.open()")}} or `target="_blank"`). If this keyword is not used, such functionality will silently fail.
    - `allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox`
      - : Allows a sandboxed document to open a new browsing context without forcing the sandboxing flags upon it. This will allow, for example, a third-party advertisement to be safely sandboxed without forcing the same restrictions upon the page the ad links to. If this flag is not included, a redirected page, popup window, or new tab will be subject to the same sandbox restrictions as the originating `<iframe>`.
    - `allow-presentation`
      - : Allows embedders to have control over whether an iframe can start a [presentation session](/en-US/docs/Web/API/PresentationRequest).
    - `allow-same-origin`
      - : If this token is not used, the resource is treated as being from a special origin that always fails the {{Glossary("same-origin policy")}} (potentially preventing access to [data storage/cookies](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy#cross-origin_data_storage_access) and some JavaScript APIs).
    - `allow-scripts`
      - : Allows the page to run scripts (but not create pop-up windows). If this keyword is not used, this operation is not allowed.
    - `allow-storage-access-by-user-activation` {{experimental_inline}}
      - : Allows a document loaded in the `<iframe>` to use the {{domxref("Storage Access API", "Storage Access API", "", "nocode")}} to request access to unpartitioned cookies.
    - `allow-top-navigation`
      - : Lets the resource navigate the top-level browsing context (the one named `_top`).
    - `allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation`
      - : Lets the resource navigate the top-level browsing context, but only if initiated by a user gesture.
    - `allow-top-navigation-to-custom-protocols`
      - : Allows navigations to non-`http` protocols built into browser or [registered by a website](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/registerProtocolHandler). This feature is also activated by `allow-popups` or `allow-top-navigation` keyword.

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > - When the embedded document has the same origin as the embedding page, it is **strongly discouraged** to use both `allow-scripts` and `allow-same-origin`, as that lets the embedded document remove the `sandbox` attribute — making it no more secure than not using the `sandbox` attribute at all.
    > - Sandboxing is useless if the attacker can display content outside a sandboxed `iframe` — such as if the viewer opens the frame in a new tab. Such content should be also served from a _separate origin_ to limit potential damage.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When redirecting the user, opening a popup window, or opening a new tab from an embedded page within an `<iframe>` with the `sandbox` attribute, the new browsing context is subject to the same `sandbox` restrictions. This can create issues — for example, if a page embedded within an `<iframe>` without a `sandbox="allow-forms"` or `sandbox="allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"` attribute set on it opens a new site in a separate tab, form submission in that new browsing context will silently fail.

- `src`
  - : The URL of the page to embed. Use a value of `about:blank` to embed an empty page that conforms to the [same-origin policy](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy#inherited_origins). Also note that programmatically removing an `<iframe>`'s src attribute (e.g., via {{domxref("Element.removeAttribute()")}}) causes `about:blank` to be loaded in the frame in Firefox (from version 65), Chromium-based browsers, and Safari/iOS.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The `about:blank` page uses the embedding document's URL as its base URL when resolving any relative URLs, such as anchor links.

- `srcdoc`
  - : Inline HTML to embed, overriding the `src` attribute. Its content should follow the syntax of a full HTML document, which includes the doctype directive, `<html>`, `<body>` tags, etc., although most of them can be omitted, leaving only the body content. This doc will have `about:srcdoc` as its location. If a browser does not support the `srcdoc` attribute, it will fall back to the URL in the `src` attribute.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The `about:srcdoc` page uses the embedding document's URL as its base URL when resolving any relative URLs, such as anchor links.

- `width`
  - : The width of the frame in CSS pixels. Default is `300`.

### Deprecated attributes

These attributes are deprecated and may no longer be supported by all user agents. You should not use them in new content, and try to remove them from existing content.

- `align` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : The alignment of this element with respect to the surrounding context.
- `frameborder` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : The value `1` (the default) draws a border around this frame. The value `0` removes the border around this frame, but you should instead use the CSS property {{cssxref("border")}} to control `<iframe>` borders.
- `longdesc` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : A URL of a long description of the frame's content. Due to widespread misuse, this is not helpful for non-visual browsers.
- `marginheight` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : The amount of space in pixels between the frame's content and its top and bottom borders.
- `marginwidth` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : The amount of space in pixels between the frame's content and its left and right borders.
- `scrolling` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : Indicates when the browser should provide a scrollbar for the frame:
    - `auto`
      - : Only when the frame's content is larger than its dimensions.
    - `yes`
      - : Always show a scrollbar.
    - `no`
      - : Never show a scrollbar.

## Scripting

Inline frames, like {{HTMLElement("frame")}} elements, are included in the {{domxref("window.frames")}} pseudo-array.

With the DOM {{domxref("HTMLIFrameElement")}} object, scripts can access the {{domxref("window")}} object of the framed resource via the {{domxref("HTMLIFrameElement.contentWindow", "contentWindow")}} property. The {{domxref("HTMLIFrameElement.contentDocument", "contentDocument")}} property refers to the `document` inside the `<iframe>`, same as `contentWindow.document`.

From the inside of a frame, a script can get a reference to its parent window with {{domxref("window.parent")}}.

Script access to a frame's content is subject to the [same-origin policy](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy).
Scripts cannot access most properties in other `window` objects if the script was loaded from a different origin, including scripts inside a frame accessing the frame's parent.
Cross-origin communication can be achieved using {{domxref("Window.postMessage()")}}.

### Top navigation in cross-origin frames

Scripts running in a same-origin frame can access the {{domxref("Window.top")}} property and set {{domxref("Window.location","window.top.location")}} to redirect the top-level page to a new location.
This behavior is referred to as "top navigation".

A cross-origin frame is allowed to redirect the top-level page using `top` only if the frame has {{glossary("sticky activation")}}.
If top navigation is blocked, browsers may either prompt for user permission to redirect or report the error in the developer console (or both).
This restriction by browsers is called _framebusting intervention_.
What this means is that a cross-origin frame can't immediately redirect the top-level page — the user must have previously interacted with the frame or granted permission to redirect.

A sandboxed frame blocks all top navigation unless the `sandbox` attribute values are set to [`allow-top-navigation`](#allow-top-navigation) or [`allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation`](#allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation).
Note that top-navigation permissions are inherited, so a nested frame can perform a top navigation only if its parent frames are also allowed to.

## Positioning and scaling

Being a {{ glossary("replaced elements", "replaced element")}}, the `<iframe>` allows the position of the embedded document within its box to be adjusted using the {{cssxref("object-position")}} property.

> [!NOTE]
> The {{cssxref("object-fit")}} property has no effect on `<iframe>` elements.

## `error` and `load` event behavior

The `error` and `load` events fired on `<iframe>`s could be used to probe the URL space of the local network's HTTP servers. Therefore, as a security precaution user agents do not fire the [error](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/error_event) event on `<iframe>`s, and the [load](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/load_event) event is always triggered even if the `<iframe>` content fails to load.

## Accessibility

People navigating with assistive technology such as a screen reader can use the [`title` attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/title) on an `<iframe>` to label its content. The title's value should concisely describe the embedded content:

```html
<iframe
  title="Wikipedia page for Avocados"
  src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avocado"></iframe>
```

Without this title, they have to navigate into the `<iframe>` to determine what its embedded content is. This context shift can be confusing and time-consuming, especially for pages with multiple `<iframe>`s and/or if embeds contain interactive content like video or audio.

## Examples

### A basic \<iframe>

This example embeds the page at <https://example.org> in an iframe. This is a common use case of iframes: to embed content from another site. For example, the live sample itself, and the [try it](#try_it) example at the top, are both `<iframe>` embeds of content from another MDN site.

#### HTML

```html
<iframe
  src="https://example.org"
  title="iframe Example 1"
  width="400"
  height="300">
</iframe>
```

#### Result

{{ EmbedLiveSample('A_basic_iframe', 640,400)}}

### Embedding source code in an \<iframe>

This example directly renders source code in an iframe. This can be used as a technique to prevent script injection when displaying user-generated content, when combined with the `sandbox` attribute.

Note that when using `srcdoc`, any relative URLs in the embedded content will be resolved relative to the URL of the embedding page. If you want to use anchor links that point to places in the embedded content, you need to explicitly specify `about:srcdoc` as the base URL.

#### HTML

```html-nolint
<article>
  <footer>Nine minutes ago, <i>jc</i> wrote:</footer>
  <iframe
    sandbox
    srcdoc="<p>There are two ways to use the <code>iframe</code> element:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href=&quot;about:srcdoc#embed_another&quot;>To embed content from another page</a></li>
<li><a href=&quot;about:srcdoc#embed_user&quot;>To embed user-generated content</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id=&quot;embed_another&quot;>Embedding content from another page</h2>
<p>Use the <code>src</code> attribute to specify the URL of the page to embed:</p>
<pre><code>&amp;lt;iframe src=&quot;https://example.org&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;</code></pre>
<h2 id=&quot;embed_user&quot;>Embedding user-generated content</h2>
<p>Use the <code>srcdoc</code> attribute to specify the content to embed. This post is already an example!</p>
"
    width="500"
    height="250"
></iframe>
</article>
```

Here's how to write escape sequences when using `srcdoc`:

- First, write the HTML out, escaping anything you would escape in a normal HTML document (such as `<`, `>`, `&`, etc.).
- `&lt;` and `<` represent the exact same character in the `srcdoc` attribute. Therefore, to make it an actual escape sequence in the HTML document, replace any ampersands (`&`) with `&amp;`. For example, `&lt;` becomes `&amp;lt;`, and `&amp;` becomes `&amp;amp;`.
- Replace any double quotes (`"`) with `&quot;` to prevent the `srcdoc` attribute from being prematurely terminated (if you use `'` instead, then you should replace `'` with `&apos;` instead). This step happens after the previous one, so `&quot;` generated in this step doesn't become `&amp;quot;`.

# <img>: The Image Embed element

The **`<img>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element embeds an image into the document.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;img&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<img
  class="fit-picture"
  src="/shared-assets/images/examples/grapefruit-slice.jpg"
  alt="Grapefruit slice atop a pile of other slices" />
```

```css interactive-example
.fit-picture {
  width: 250px;
}
```

The above example shows usage of the `<img>` element:

- The `src` attribute holds the path to the image you want to embed. It is not mandatory if the [srcset](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/srcset) attribute is available. However, at least one of the `src` or `srcset` attributes must be provided.
- The `alt` attribute holds a textual replacement for the image, which is mandatory and **incredibly useful** for accessibility — screen readers read the attribute value out to their users so they know what the image means. Alt text is also displayed on the page if the image can't be loaded for some reason: for example, network errors, content blocking, or link rot.

There are many other attributes to achieve various purposes:

- [Referrer](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Referrer-Policy)/{{glossary("CORS")}} control for security and privacy: see [`crossorigin`](#crossorigin) and [`referrerpolicy`](#referrerpolicy).
- Use both [`width`](#width) and [`height`](#height) to set the intrinsic size of the image, allowing it to take up space before it loads, to mitigate content layout shifts.
- Responsive image hints with [`sizes`](#sizes) and [`srcset`](#srcset) (see also the {{htmlelement("picture")}} element and our [Responsive images](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Responsive_images) tutorial).

## Supported image formats

The HTML standard doesn't list what image formats to support, so {{glossary("user agent","user agents")}} may support different formats.

> [!NOTE]
> The [Image file type and format guide](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Image_types) provides comprehensive information about image formats and their web browser support.
> This section is just a summary!

The image file formats that are most commonly used on the web are:

- [APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics)](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Image_types#apng_animated_portable_network_graphics) — Good choice for lossless animation sequences (GIF is less performant)
- [AVIF (AV1 Image File Format)](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Image_types#avif_image) — Good choice for both images and animated images due to high performance.
- [GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Image_types#gif_graphics_interchange_format) — Good choice for _simple_ images and animations.
- [JPEG (Joint Photographic Expert Group image)](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Image_types#jpeg_joint_photographic_experts_group_image) — Good choice for lossy compression of still images (currently the most popular).
- [PNG (Portable Network Graphics)](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Image_types#png_portable_network_graphics) — Good choice for lossless compression of still images (slightly better quality than JPEG).
- [SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Image_types#svg_scalable_vector_graphics) — Vector image format. Use for images that must be drawn accurately at different sizes.
- [WebP (Web Picture format)](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Image_types#webp_image) — Excellent choice for both images and animated images

Formats like [WebP](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Image_types#webp_image) and [AVIF](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Image_types#avif_image) are recommended as they perform much better than PNG, JPEG, GIF for both still and animated images.

SVG remains the recommended format for images that must be drawn accurately at different sizes.

## Image loading errors

If an error occurs while loading or rendering an image, and an `onerror` event handler has been set for the {{domxref("HTMLElement/error_event", "error")}} event, that event handler will get called. This can happen in several situations, including:

- The `src` or `srcset` attributes are empty (`""`) or `null`.
- The `src` {{glossary("URL")}} is the same as the URL of the page the user is currently on.
- The image is corrupted in some way that prevents it from being loaded.
- The image's metadata is corrupted in such a way that it's impossible to retrieve its dimensions, and no dimensions were specified in the `<img>` element's attributes.
- The image is in a format not supported by the {{Glossary("user agent")}}.

## Attributes

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

- [`alt`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/alt#usage_notes)
  - : Defines text that can replace the image in the page.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Browsers do not always display images. There are a number of situations in which a browser might not display images, such as:
    >
    > - Non-visual browsers (such as those used by people with visual impairments)
    > - The user chooses not to display images (saving bandwidth, privacy reasons)
    > - The image is invalid or an [unsupported type](#supported_image_formats)
    >
    > In these cases, the browser may replace the image with the text in the element's `alt` attribute. For these reasons and others, provide a useful value for `alt` whenever possible.

    Setting this attribute to an empty string (`alt=""`) indicates that this image is _not_ a key part of the content (it's decoration or a tracking pixel), and that non-visual browsers may omit it from {{glossary("Engine/Rendering", "rendering")}}. Visual browsers will also hide the broken image icon if the `alt` attribute is empty and the image failed to display.

    This attribute is also used when copying and pasting the image to text, or saving a linked image to a bookmark.

- `attributionsrc` {{experimental_inline}}
  - : Specifies that you want the browser to send an {{httpheader("Attribution-Reporting-Eligible")}} header along with the image request.

    On the server-side this is used to trigger sending an {{httpheader("Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source")}} or {{httpheader("Attribution-Reporting-Register-Trigger")}} header in the response, to register an image-based [attribution source](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Attribution_Reporting_API/Registering_sources#html-based_event_sources) or [attribution trigger](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Attribution_Reporting_API/Registering_triggers#html-based_attribution_triggers), respectively. Which response header should be sent back depends on the value of the `Attribution-Reporting-Eligible` header that triggered the registration.

    The corresponding source or trigger event is set off once the browser receives the response containing the image file.

    > [!NOTE]
    > See the [Attribution Reporting API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Attribution_Reporting_API) for more details.

    There are two versions of this attribute that you can set:
    - Boolean, i.e., just the `attributionsrc` name. This specifies that you want the {{httpheader("Attribution-Reporting-Eligible")}} header sent to the same server as the `src` attribute points to. This is fine when you are handling the attribution source or trigger registration on the same server. When registering an attribution trigger this property is optional, and a boolean value will be used if it is omitted.
    - Value containing one or more URLs, for example:

    ```html
    <img
      src="image-file.png"
      alt="My image file description"
      attributionsrc="https://a.example/register-source
                         https://b.example/register-source" />
    ```

    This is useful in cases where the requested resource is not on a server you control, or you just want to handle registering the attribution source on a different server. In this case, you can specify one or more URLs as the value of `attributionsrc`. When the resource request occurs the {{httpheader("Attribution-Reporting-Eligible")}} header will be sent to the URL(s) specified in `attributionSrc` in addition to the resource origin. These URLs can then respond with a {{httpheader("Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source")}} or {{httpheader("Attribution-Reporting-Register-Trigger")}} header as appropriate to complete registration.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Specifying multiple URLs means that multiple attribution sources can be registered on the same feature. You might for example have different campaigns that you are trying to measure the success of, which involve generating different reports on different data.

- [`crossorigin`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/crossorigin)
  - : Indicates if the fetching of the image must be done using a {{glossary("CORS")}} request. Image data from a [CORS-enabled image](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/How_to/CORS_enabled_image) returned from a CORS request can be reused in the {{HTMLElement("canvas")}} element without being marked "[tainted](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/How_to/CORS_enabled_image#security_and_tainted_canvases)".

    If the `crossorigin` attribute is _not_ specified, then a non-CORS request is sent (without the {{httpheader("Origin")}} request header), and the browser marks the image as tainted and restricts access to its image data, preventing its usage in {{HTMLElement("canvas")}} elements.

    If the `crossorigin` attribute _is_ specified, then a CORS request is sent (with the {{httpheader("Origin")}} request header); but if the server does not opt into allowing cross-origin access to the image data by the origin site (by not sending any {{httpheader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin")}} response header, or by not including the site's origin in any {{httpheader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin")}} response header it does send), then the browser blocks the image from loading, and logs a CORS error to the devtools console.

    Allowed values:
    - `anonymous`
      - : A CORS request is sent with credentials omitted (that is, no {{glossary("cookie", "cookies")}}, [X.509 certificates](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280), or {{httpheader("Authorization")}} request header).
    - `use-credentials`
      - : The CORS request is sent with any credentials included (that is, cookies, X.509 certificates, and the `Authorization` request header). If the server does not opt into sharing credentials with the origin site (by sending back the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` response header), then the browser marks the image as tainted and restricts access to its image data.

    If the attribute has an invalid value, browsers handle it as if the `anonymous` value was used. See [CORS settings attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/crossorigin) for additional information.

- `decoding`
  - : This attribute provides a hint to the browser as to whether it should perform image decoding along with rendering the other DOM content in a single presentation step that looks more "correct" (`sync`), or render and present the other DOM content first and then decode the image and present it later (`async`). In practice, `async` means that the next paint does not wait for the image to decode.

    It is often difficult to perceive any noticeable effect when using `decoding` on static `<img>` elements. They'll likely be initially rendered as empty images while the image files are fetched (either from the network or from the cache) and then handled independently anyway, so the "syncing" of content updates is less apparent. However, the blocking of rendering while decoding happens, while often quite small, _can_ be measured — even if it is difficult to observe with the human eye. See [What does the image decoding attribute actually do?](https://www.tunetheweb.com/blog/what-does-the-image-decoding-attribute-actually-do/) for a more detailed analysis (tunetheweb.com, 2023).

    Using different `decoding` types can result in more noticeable differences when dynamically inserting `<img>` elements into the DOM via JavaScript — see {{domxref("HTMLImageElement.decoding")}} for more details.

    Allowed values:
    - `sync`
      - : Decode the image synchronously along with rendering the other DOM content, and present everything together.
    - `async`
      - : Decode the image asynchronously, after rendering and presenting the other DOM content.
    - `auto`
      - : No preference for the decoding mode; the browser decides what is best for the user. This is the default value.

- [`elementtiming`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/elementtiming)
  - : Marks the image for observation by the {{domxref("PerformanceElementTiming")}} API. The value given becomes an identifier for the observed image element. See also the [`elementtiming`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/elementtiming) attribute page.

- `fetchpriority`
  - : Provides a hint of the relative priority to use when fetching the image.
    Allowed values:
    - `high`
      - : Fetch the image at a high priority relative to other images.
    - `low`
      - : Fetch the image at a low priority relative to other images.
    - `auto`
      - : Don't set a preference for the fetch priority.
        This is the default.
        It is used if no value or an invalid value is set.

    See {{domxref("HTMLImageElement.fetchPriority")}} for more information.

- `height`
  - : The intrinsic height of the image, in pixels. Must be an integer without a unit.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Including `height` and [`width`](#width) enables the {{glossary("aspect ratio")}} of the image to be calculated by the browser prior to the image being loaded. This aspect ratio is used to reserve the space needed to display the image, reducing or even preventing a layout shift when the image is downloaded and painted to the screen. Reducing layout shift is a major component of good user experience and web performance.

- `ismap`
  - : This Boolean attribute indicates that the image is part of a [server-side map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_map#Server-side). If so, the coordinates where the user clicked on the image are sent to the server.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This attribute is allowed only if the `<img>` element is a descendant of an {{htmlelement("a")}} element with a valid [`href`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/a#href) attribute. This gives users without pointing devices a fallback destination.

- `loading`
  - : Indicates how the browser should load the image:
    - `eager`
      - : Loads the image immediately, regardless of whether or not the image is currently within the visible viewport (this is the default value).
    - `lazy`
      - : Defers loading the image until it reaches a calculated distance from the viewport, as defined by the browser. The intent is to avoid the network and storage bandwidth needed to handle the image until it's reasonably certain that it will be needed. This generally improves the performance of the content in most typical use cases.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Loading is only deferred when JavaScript is enabled. This is an anti-tracking measure, because if a user agent supported lazy loading when scripting is disabled, it would still be possible for a site to track a user's approximate scroll position throughout a session, by strategically placing images in a page's markup such that a server can track how many images are requested and when.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Images with `loading` set to `lazy` will never be loaded if they do not intersect a visible part of an element, even if loading them would change that as unloaded images have a `width` and `height` of `0`. Putting `width` and `height` on lazy-loaded images fixes this issue and is a best practice, [recommended by the specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#the-img-element). Doing so also helps prevent layout shifts.

- `referrerpolicy`
  - : A string indicating which referrer to use when fetching the resource:
    - `no-referrer`: The {{HTTPHeader("Referer")}} header will not be sent.
    - `no-referrer-when-downgrade`: The {{HTTPHeader("Referer")}} header will not be sent to {{Glossary("origin")}}s without {{Glossary("TLS")}} ({{Glossary("HTTPS")}}).
    - `origin`: The sent referrer will be limited to the origin of the referring page: its [scheme](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_URL), {{Glossary("host")}}, and {{Glossary("port")}}.
    - `origin-when-cross-origin`: The referrer sent to other origins will be limited to the scheme, the host, and the port. Navigations on the same origin will still include the path.
    - `same-origin`: A referrer will be sent for {{Glossary("Same-origin policy", "same origin")}}, but cross-origin requests will contain no referrer information.
    - `strict-origin`: Only send the origin of the document as the referrer when the protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), but don't send it to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP).
    - `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` (default): Send a full URL when performing a same-origin request, only send the origin when the protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), and send no header to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP).
    - `unsafe-url`: The referrer will include the origin _and_ the path (but not the [fragment](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement/hash), [password](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement/password), or [username](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement/username)). **This value is unsafe**, because it leaks origins and paths from TLS-protected resources to insecure origins.

- `sizes`
  - : One or more values separated by commas, which can be source sizes or the `auto` keyword.

    A **source size** consists of:
    1. A [media condition](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries#syntax), omitted for the last item in the list.
    2. A source size value.

    Media conditions describe properties of the _viewport_, not the _image_. For example, `(height <= 500px) 1000px` proposes using an image source of 1000px width if the _viewport_ height is 500px or less. Because a source size descriptor specifies the width to use for the image during layout, the media condition is typically (but not necessarily) based on the [width](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/width).

    Source size values specify the intended display size of the image. {{glossary("User agent", "User agents")}} use the current source size to select one of the sources supplied by the `srcset` attribute, when those sources are described using width (`w`) descriptors. The selected source size affects the {{glossary("intrinsic size")}} of the image (the image's display size if no {{glossary("CSS")}} styling is applied). If the `srcset` attribute is absent, or contains no values with a width descriptor, then the `sizes` attribute has no effect.

    A source size value can be any non-negative [length](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length). It must not use CSS functions other than the [math functions](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_and_units/CSS_value_functions#math_functions). Units are interpreted in the same way as [media queries](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries), meaning that all relative length units are relative to the document root rather than the `<img>` element. For example, an `em` value is relative to the root font size, not the font size of the image. [Percentage](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/percentage) values are not allowed.

    The `auto` keyword can replace the whole list of sizes or the first entry in the list. It is only valid when combined with `loading="lazy"`, and resolves to the [concrete size](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image) of the image. Since the intrinsic size of the image is not yet known, `width` and `height` attributes (or CSS equivalents) should also be specified to prevent the browser from assuming the default image width of 300px.
    For better backward compatibility with browsers that do not support `auto`, you can include fallback sizes after `auto` in the `sizes` attribute:

    ```html
    <img
      loading="lazy"
      width="200"
      height="200"
      sizes="auto, (max-width: 30em) 100vw, (max-width: 50em) 50vw, calc(33vw - 100px)"
      srcset="
        swing-200.jpg   200w,
        swing-400.jpg   400w,
        swing-800.jpg   800w,
        swing-1600.jpg 1600w
      "
      src="swing-400.jpg"
      alt="Kettlebell Swing" />
    ```

- `src`
  - : The image {{glossary("URL")}}. Mandatory for the `<img>` element. On {{glossary("Browser", "browsers")}} supporting `srcset`, `src` is treated like a candidate image with a pixel density descriptor `1x`, unless an image with this pixel density descriptor is already defined in `srcset`, or unless `srcset` contains `w` descriptors.
- `srcset`
  - : One or more strings separated by commas, indicating possible image sources for the {{glossary("user agent")}} to use. Each string is composed of:
    1. A {{glossary("URL")}} to an image
    2. Optionally, whitespace followed by one of:
       - A width descriptor (a positive integer directly followed by `w`). The width descriptor is divided by the source size given in the `sizes` attribute to calculate the effective pixel density.
       - A pixel density descriptor (a positive floating point number directly followed by `x`).

    If no descriptor is specified, the source is assigned the default descriptor of `1x`.

    It is incorrect to mix width descriptors and pixel density descriptors in the same `srcset` attribute. Duplicate descriptors (for instance, two sources in the same `srcset` which are both described with `2x`) are also invalid.

    If the `srcset` attribute uses width descriptors, the `sizes` attribute must also be present, or the `srcset` itself will be ignored.

    The user agent selects any of the available sources at its discretion. This provides them with significant leeway to tailor their selection based on things like user preferences or {{glossary("bandwidth")}} conditions. See our [Responsive images](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Responsive_images) tutorial for an example.

- `width`
  - : The intrinsic width of the image in pixels. Must be an integer without a unit.
- `usemap`
  - : The partial {{glossary("URL")}} (starting with `#`) of an [image map](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/map) associated with the element.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You cannot use this attribute if the `<img>` element is inside an {{htmlelement("a")}} or {{HTMLElement("button")}} element.

### Deprecated attributes

- `align` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : Aligns the image with its surrounding context. Use the {{cssxref('float')}} and/or {{cssxref('vertical-align')}} {{glossary("CSS")}} properties instead of this attribute. Allowed values:
    - `top`
      - : Equivalent to `vertical-align: top` or `vertical-align: text-top`
    - `middle`
      - : Equivalent to `vertical-align: -moz-middle-with-baseline`
    - `bottom`
      - : The default, equivalent to `vertical-align: unset` or `vertical-align: initial`
    - `left`
      - : Equivalent to `float: left`
    - `right`
      - : Equivalent to `float: right`

- `border` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : The width of a border around the image. Use the {{cssxref('border')}} {{glossary("CSS")}} property instead.
- `hspace` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : The number of pixels of white space on the left and right of the image. Use the {{cssxref('margin')}} CSS property instead.
- `longdesc` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : A link to a more detailed description of the image. Possible values are a {{glossary("URL")}} or an element [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/id).

    > [!NOTE]
    > This attribute is considered obsolete in the [HTML spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/obsolete.html#element-attrdef-img-longdesc). It has an uncertain future; authors should use a {{glossary("WAI")}}-{{glossary("ARIA")}} alternative such as [`aria-describedby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-describedby) or [`aria-details`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-details).

- `name` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : A name for the element. Use the [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/id) attribute instead.
- `vspace` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : The number of pixels of white space above and below the image. Use the {{cssxref('margin')}} CSS property instead.

## Styling with CSS

`<img>` is a {{ glossary("replaced elements", "replaced element")}}; it has a {{cssxref("display")}} value of `inline` by default, but its default dimensions are defined by the embedded image's intrinsic values, like it were `inline-block`. You can set properties like {{cssxref("border")}}/{{cssxref("border-radius")}}, {{cssxref("padding")}}/{{cssxref("margin")}}, {{cssxref("width")}}, {{cssxref("height")}}, etc. on an image.

`<img>` has no baseline, so when images are used in an inline formatting context with {{cssxref("vertical-align", "vertical-align: baseline")}}, the bottom of the image will be placed on the text baseline.

You can use the {{cssxref("object-position")}} property to position the image within the element's box, and the {{cssxref("object-fit")}} property to adjust the sizing of the image within the box (for example, whether the image should fit the box or fill it even if clipping is required).

Depending on its type, an image may have an intrinsic width and height. For some image types, however, intrinsic dimensions are unnecessary. {{glossary("SVG")}} images, for instance, have no intrinsic dimensions if their root {{SVGElement("svg")}} element doesn't have a `width` or `height` set on it.

## Accessibility

### Authoring meaningful alternate descriptions

An `alt` attribute's value should provide a clear and concise text replacement for the image's content. It should not describe the presence of the image itself or the file name of the image. If the `alt` attribute is purposefully left off because the image has no textual equivalent, consider alternate methods to present what the image is trying to communicate.

#### Don't

```html example-bad
<img alt="image" src="penguin.jpg" />
```

#### Do

```html example-good
<img alt="A Penguin on a beach." src="penguin.jpg" />
```

An important accessibility test is to read the `alt` attribute content together with preceding textual content to see if it conveys the same meaning as the image. For example, if the image was preceded by the sentence "On my travels, I saw a cute little animal:", the _Don't_ example could be read by a screen reader as "On my travels, I saw a cute little animal: image", which doesn't make sense. The _Do_ example could be read by a screen reader as "On my travels, I saw a cute little animal: A Penguin on a beach.", which does make sense.

For images used to trigger an action, for example, images nested inside an {{htmlelement("a")}} or {{htmlelement("button")}} element, consider describing the triggered action inside the `alt` attribute value. For example, you could write `alt="next page"` instead of `alt="arrow right"`. You could also consider adding an optional further description inside a `title` attribute; this may be read by screen readers if requested by the user.

When an `alt` attribute is not present on an image, some screen readers may announce the image's file name instead. This can be a confusing experience if the file name isn't representative of the image's contents.

### Identifying SVG as an image

Due to a [VoiceOver bug](https://webkit.org/b/216364), VoiceOver does not correctly announce SVG images as images. Include [`role="img"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/img_role) to all `<img>` elements with SVG source files to ensure assistive technologies correctly announce the SVG as image content.

```html
<img src="mdn.svg" alt="MDN" role="img" />
```

### The title attribute

The [`title`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/title) attribute is not an acceptable substitute for the `alt` attribute. Additionally, avoid duplicating the `alt` attribute's value in a `title` attribute declared on the same image. Doing so may cause some screen readers to announce the same text twice, creating a confusing experience.

The `title` attribute should also not be used as supplemental captioning information to accompany an image's `alt` description. If an image needs a caption, use the [`figure`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/figure) and [`figcaption`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/figcaption) elements.

The value of the `title` attribute is usually presented to the user as a tooltip, which appears shortly after the cursor stops moving over the image. While this _can_ provide additional information to the user, you should not assume that the user will ever see it: the user may only have keyboard or touchscreen. If you have information that's particularly important or valuable for the user, present it inline using one of the methods mentioned above instead of using `title`.

## Examples

### Alternative text

The following example embeds an image into the page and includes alternative text for accessibility.

```html
<img src="/shared-assets/images/examples/favicon144.png" alt="MDN" />
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Alternative_text', '100%', '160') }}

### Image link

This example builds upon the previous one, showing how to turn the image into a link. To do so, nest the `<img>` tag inside the {{HTMLElement("a")}}. You should make the alternative text describe the resource the link is pointing to, as if you were using a text link instead.

```html
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org">
  <img
    src="/shared-assets/images/examples/favicon144.png"
    alt="Visit the MDN site" />
</a>
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Image_link', '100%', '160') }}

### Using the srcset attribute

In this example we include a `srcset` attribute with a reference to a high-resolution version of the logo; this will be loaded instead of the `src` image on high-resolution devices. The image referenced in the `src` attribute is counted as a `1x` candidate in {{glossary("User agent", "user agents")}} that support `srcset`.

```html
<img
  src="/shared-assets/images/examples/favicon72.png"
  alt="MDN"
  srcset="/shared-assets/images/examples/favicon144.png 2x" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Using_the_srcset_attribute", "100%", "160")}}

### Using the srcset and sizes attributes

The `src` attribute is ignored in {{glossary("User agent", "user agents")}} that support `srcset` when `w` descriptors are included. When the `(width <= 600px)` media condition matches, the 200 pixel-wide image will load (it is the one that matches `200px` most closely), otherwise the other image will load.

```html
<img
  src="clock-demo-200px.png"
  alt="The time is 12:45."
  srcset="clock-demo-200px.png 200w, clock-demo-400px.png 400w"
  sizes="(width <= 600px) 200px, 50vw" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Using_the_srcset_and_sizes_attributes", "100%", 350)}}

> [!NOTE]
> To see the resizing in action, {{LiveSampleLink('Using_the_srcset_and_sizes_attributes', 'view the example on a separate page')}}, so you can actually resize the content area.

## Security and privacy concerns

Although `<img>` elements have innocent uses, they can have undesirable consequences for user security and privacy. See [Referer header: privacy and security concerns](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Referer_header:_privacy_and_security_concerns) for more information and mitigations.

# HTML elements reference

This page lists all the {{Glossary("HTML")}} {{Glossary("Element","elements")}}, which are created using {{Glossary("Tag", "tags")}}.

They are grouped by function to help you find what you have in mind easily. An alphabetical list of all elements is provided in the sidebar on every element's page as well as this one.

## Document metadata

Metadata contains information about the page. This includes information about styles, scripts and data to help software ({{Glossary("search engine", "search engines")}}, {{Glossary("Browser","browsers")}}, etc.) use and render the page. Metadata for styles and scripts may be defined in the page or linked to another file that has the information.

| Element                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| {{HTMLElement("link")}}  | Specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource. This element is most commonly used to link to CSS but is also used to establish site icons (both "favicon" style icons and icons for the home screen and apps on mobile devices) among other things. |
| {{HTMLElement("meta")}}  | Represents {{Glossary("Metadata","metadata")}} that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like {{HTMLElement("base")}}, {{HTMLElement("link")}}, {{HTMLElement("script")}}, {{HTMLElement("style")}} and {{HTMLElement("title")}}.                             |
| {{HTMLElement("style")}} | Contains style information for a document or part of a document. It contains CSS, which is applied to the contents of the document containing this element.                                                                                                                         |
| {{HTMLElement("title")}} | Defines the document's title that is shown in a {{glossary("Browser", "browser")}}'s title bar or a page's tab.

| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| {{HTMLElement("body")}} | Represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one such element in a document. |

## Content sectioning

Content sectioning elements allow you to organize the document content into logical pieces. Use the sectioning elements to create a broad outline for your page content, including header and footer navigation, and heading elements to identify sections of content.

Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions.                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Text content

Use HTML text content elements to organize blocks or sections of content placed between the opening {{HTMLElement("body")}} and closing `</body>` tags. Important for {{Glossary("accessibility")}} and {{Glossary("SEO")}}, these elements identify the purpose or structure of that content.

| Element                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| {{HTMLElement("blockquote")}} | Indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation. A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the `cite` attribute, while a text representation of the source can be given using the {{HTMLElement("cite")}} element.                                                                                                       |
| {{HTMLElement("dd")}}         | Provides the description, definition, or value for the preceding term ({{HTMLElement("dt")}}) in a description list ({{HTMLElement("dl")}}).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| {{HTMLElement("div")}}        | The generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS (e.g., styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like {{glossary("Flexbox", "flexbox")}} is applied to its parent element).                                                                                                                               |
| {{HTMLElement("dl")}}         | Represents a description list. The element encloses a list of groups of terms (specified using the {{HTMLElement("dt")}} element) and descriptions (provided by {{HTMLElement("dd")}} elements). Common uses for this element are to implement a glossary or to display metadata (a list of key-value pairs).                                                                                        |
| {{HTMLElement("dt")}}         | Specifies a term in a description or definition list, and as such must be used inside a {{HTMLElement("dl")}} element. It is usually followed by a {{HTMLElement("dd")}} element; however, multiple `<dt>` elements in a row indicate several terms that are all defined by the immediate next {{HTMLElement("dd")}} element.                                                                        |
| {{HTMLElement("figcaption")}} | Represents a caption or legend describing the rest of the contents of its parent {{HTMLElement("figure")}} element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| {{HTMLElement("figure")}}     | Represents self-contained content, potentially with an optional caption, which is specified using the {{HTMLElement("figcaption")}} element. The figure, its caption, and its contents are referenced as a single unit.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| {{HTMLElement("hr")}}         | Represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| {{HTMLElement("li")}}         | Represents an item in a list. It must be contained in a parent element: an ordered list ({{HTMLElement("ol")}}), an unordered list ({{HTMLElement("ul")}}), or a menu ({{HTMLElement("menu")}}). In menus and unordered lists, list items are usually displayed using bullet points. In ordered lists, they are usually displayed with an ascending counter on the left, such as a number or letter. |
| {{HTMLElement("menu")}}       | A semantic alternative to {{HTMLElement("ul")}}, but treated by browsers (and exposed through the accessibility tree) as no different than {{HTMLElement("ul")}}. It represents an unordered list of items (which are represented by {{HTMLElement("li")}} elements).                                                                                                                                |
| {{HTMLElement("ol")}}         | Represents an ordered list of items — typically rendered as a numbered list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| {{HTMLElement("p")}}          | Represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.                                                                                                                      |
| {{HTMLElement("pre")}}        | Represents preformatted text which is to be presented exactly as written in the HTML file. The text is typically rendered using a non-proportional, or [monospaced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font), font. Whitespace inside this element is displayed as written.                                                                                                                    |
| {{HTMLElement("ul")}}         | Represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Inline text semantics

Use the HTML inline text semantic to define the meaning, structure, or style of a word, line, or any arbitrary piece of text.

| Element                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| {{HTMLElement("a")}}      | Together with its `href` attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations within the current page, or anything else a URL can address.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| {{HTMLElement("abbr")}}   | Represents an abbreviation or acronym.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| {{HTMLElement("b")}}      | Used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use `<b>` for styling text or granting importance. If you wish to create boldface text, you should use the CSS {{cssxref("font-weight")}} property. If you wish to indicate an element is of special importance, you should use the {{HTMLElement("strong")}} element.                         |
| {{HTMLElement("bdi")}}    | Tells the browser's bidirectional algorithm to treat the text it contains in isolation from its surrounding text. It's particularly useful when a website dynamically inserts some text and doesn't know the directionality of the text being inserted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| {{HTMLElement("bdo")}}    | Overrides the current directionality of text, so that the text within is rendered in a different direction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| {{HTMLElement("br")}}     | Produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| {{HTMLElement("cite")}}   | Used to mark up the title of a creative work. The reference may be in an abbreviated form according to context-appropriate conventions related to citation metadata.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| {{HTMLElement("code")}}   | Displays its contents styled in a fashion intended to indicate that the text is a short fragment of computer code. By default, the content text is displayed using the user agent's default monospace font.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| {{HTMLElement("data")}}   | Links a given piece of content with a machine-readable translation. If the content is time- or date-related, the `<time>` element must be used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| {{HTMLElement("dfn")}}    | Used to indicate the term being defined within the context of a definition phrase or sentence. The ancestor {{HTMLElement("p")}} element, the {{HTMLElement("dt")}}/{{HTMLElement("dd")}} pairing, or the nearest section ancestor of the `<dfn>` element, is considered to be the definition of the term.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| {{HTMLElement("em")}}     | Marks text that has stress emphasis. The `<em>` element can be nested, with each nesting level indicating a greater degree of emphasis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| {{HTMLElement("i")}}      | Represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, and taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the `<i>` naming of this element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| {{HTMLElement("kbd")}}    | Represents a span of inline text denoting textual user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text entry device. By convention, the user agent defaults to rendering the contents of a `<kbd>` element using its default monospace font, although this is not mandated by the HTML standard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| {{HTMLElement("mark")}}   | Represents text which is marked or highlighted for reference or notation purposes due to the marked passage's relevance in the enclosing context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| {{HTMLElement("q")}}      | Indicates that the enclosed text is a short inline quotation. Most modern browsers implement this by surrounding the text in quotation marks. This element is intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks; for long quotations use the {{HTMLElement("blockquote")}} element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| {{HTMLElement("rp")}}     | Used to provide fall-back parentheses for browsers that do not support the display of ruby annotations using the {{HTMLElement("ruby")}} element. One `<rp>` element should enclose each of the opening and closing parentheses that wrap the {{HTMLElement("rt")}} element that contains the annotation's text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| {{HTMLElement("rt")}}     | Specifies the ruby text component of a ruby annotation, which is used to provide pronunciation, translation, or transliteration information for East Asian typography. The `<rt>` element must always be contained within a {{HTMLElement("ruby")}} element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| {{HTMLElement("ruby")}}   | Represents small annotations that are rendered above, below, or next to base text, usually used for showing the pronunciation of East Asian characters. It can also be used for annotating other kinds of text, but this usage is less common.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| {{HTMLElement("s")}}      | Renders text with a strikethrough, or a line through it. Use the `<s>` element to represent things that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate. However, `<s>` is not appropriate when indicating document edits; for that, use the {{HTMLElement("del")}} and {{HTMLElement("ins")}} elements, as appropriate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| {{HTMLElement("samp")}}   | Used to enclose inline text which represents sample (or quoted) output from a computer program. Its contents are typically rendered using the browser's default monospaced font (such as [Courier](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier_(typeface)>) or Lucida Console).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| {{HTMLElement("small")}}  | Represents side-comments and small print, like copyright and legal text, independent of its styled presentation. By default, it renders text within it one font size smaller, such as from `small` to `x-small`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| {{HTMLElement("span")}}   | A generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the `class` or `id` attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as `lang`. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. `<span>` is very much like a div element, but div is a [block-level element](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Block-level_content) whereas a `<span>` is an [inline-level element](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Inline-level_content). |
| {{HTMLElement("strong")}} | Indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| {{HTMLElement("sub")}}    | Specifies inline text which should be displayed as subscript for solely typographical reasons. Subscripts are typically rendered with a lowered baseline using smaller text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| {{HTMLElement("sup")}}    | Specifies inline text which is to be displayed as superscript for solely typographical reasons. Superscripts are usually rendered with a raised baseline using smaller text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| {{HTMLElement("time")}}   | Represents a specific period in time. It may include the `datetime` attribute to translate dates into machine-readable format, allowing for better search engine results or custom features such as reminders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| {{HTMLElement("u")}}      | Represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a single solid underline but may be altered using CSS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| {{HTMLElement("var")}}    | Represents the name of a variable in a mathematical expression or a programming context. It's typically presented using an italicized version of the current typeface, although that behavior is browser-dependent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| {{HTMLElement("wbr")}}    | Represents a word break opportunity—a position within text where the browser may optionally break a line, though its line-breaking rules would not otherwise create a break at that location.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Image and multimedia

HTML supports various multimedia resources such as images, audio, and video.

| Element                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| {{HTMLElement("area")}}  | Defines an area inside an image map that has predefined clickable areas. An _image map_ allows geometric areas on an image to be associated with {{Glossary("Hyperlink", "hyperlink")}}.                                                                                               |
| {{HTMLElement("audio")}} | Used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain one or more audio sources, represented using the `src` attribute or the source element: the browser will choose the most suitable one. It can also be the destination for streamed media, using a {{domxref("MediaStream")}}. |
| {{HTMLElement("img")}}   | Embeds an image into the document.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| {{HTMLElement("map")}}   | Used with {{HTMLElement("area")}} elements to define an image map (a clickable link area).                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| {{HTMLElement("track")}} | Used as a child of the media elements, audio and video. It lets you specify timed text tracks (or time-based data), for example to automatically handle subtitles. The tracks are formatted in [WebVTT format](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API) (`.vtt` files)—Web Video Text Tracks.   |
| {{HTMLElement("video")}} | Embeds a media player which supports video playback into the document. You can also use `<video>` for audio content, but the audio element may provide a more appropriate user experience.                                                                                             |

## Embedded content

In addition to regular multimedia content, HTML can include a variety of other content, even if it's not always easy to interact with.

| Element                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| {{HTMLElement("embed")}}       | Embeds external content at the specified point in the document. This content is provided by an external application or other source of interactive content such as a browser plug-in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| {{HTMLElement("fencedframe")}} | Represents a nested browsing context, like `<iframe>` but with more native privacy features built in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| {{HTMLElement("iframe")}}      | Represents a nested browsing context, embedding another HTML page into the current one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| {{HTMLElement("object")}}      | Represents an external resource, which can be treated as an image, a nested browsing context, or a resource to be handled by a plugin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| {{HTMLElement("picture")}}     | Contains zero or more {{HTMLElement("source")}} elements and one {{HTMLElement("img")}} element to offer alternative versions of an image for different display/device scenarios.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| {{HTMLElement("source")}}      | Specifies multiple media resources for the picture, the audio element, or the video element. It is a void element, meaning that it has no content and does not have a closing tag. It is commonly used to offer the same media content in multiple file formats in order to provide compatibility with a broad range of browsers given their differing support for [image file formats](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Image_types) and [media file formats](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats). |

## SVG and MathML

You can embed [SVG](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) and [MathML](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML) content directly into HTML documents, using the {{SVGElement("svg")}} and {{MathMLElement("math")}} elements.

| Element                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| {{SVGElement("svg")}}     | Container defining a new coordinate system and [viewport](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/viewBox). It is used as the outermost element of SVG documents, but it can also be used to embed an SVG fragment inside an SVG or HTML document. |
| {{MathMLElement("math")}} | The top-level element in MathML. Every valid MathML instance must be wrapped in it. In addition, you must not nest a second `<math>` element in another, but you can have an arbitrary number of other child elements in it.                       |

## Scripting

To create dynamic content and Web applications, HTML supports the use of scripting languages, most prominently JavaScript. Certain elements support this capability.

| Element                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| {{HTMLElement("canvas")}}   | Container element to use with either the [canvas scripting API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) or the [WebGL API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) to draw graphics and animations.                                                                                                         |
| {{HTMLElement("noscript")}} | Defines a section of HTML to be inserted if a script type on the page is unsupported or if scripting is currently turned off in the browser.                                                                                                                                               |
| {{HTMLElement("script")}}   | Used to embed executable code or data; this is typically used to embed or refer to JavaScript code. The `<script>` element can also be used with other languages, such as [WebGL](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API)'s GLSL shader programming language and [JSON](/en-US/docs/Glossary/JSON). |

## Demarcating edits

These elements let you provide indications that specific parts of the text have been altered.

| Element                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| {{HTMLElement("del")}} | Represents a range of text that has been deleted from a document. This can be used when rendering "track changes" or source code diff information, for example. The `<ins>` element can be used for the opposite purpose: to indicate text that has been added to the document. |
| {{HTMLElement("ins")}} | Represents a range of text that has been added to a document. You can use the `<del>` element to similarly represent a range of text that has been deleted from the document.                                                                                                   |

## Table content

The elements here are used to create and handle tabular data.

| Element                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| {{HTMLElement("caption")}}  | Specifies the caption (or title) of a table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| {{HTMLElement("col")}}      | Defines one or more columns in a column group represented by its implicit or explicit parent {{HTMLElement("colgroup")}} element. The `<col>` element is only valid as a child of a {{HTMLElement("colgroup")}} element that has no [`span`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/colgroup#span) attribute defined. |
| {{HTMLElement("colgroup")}} | Defines a group of columns within a table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| {{HTMLElement("table")}}    | Represents tabular data—that is, information presented in a two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| {{HTMLElement("tbody")}}    | Encapsulates a set of table rows ({{HTMLElement("tr")}} elements), indicating that they comprise the body of a table's (main) data.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| {{HTMLElement("td")}}       | A child of the {{HTMLElement("tr")}} element, it defines a cell of a table that contains data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| {{HTMLElement("tfoot")}}    | Encapsulates a set of table rows ({{HTMLElement("tr")}} elements), indicating that they comprise the foot of a table with information about the table's columns. This is usually a summary of the columns, e.g., a sum of the given numbers in a column.                                                               |
| {{HTMLElement("th")}}       | A child of the {{HTMLElement("tr")}} element, it defines a cell as the header of a group of table cells. The nature of this group can be explicitly defined by the [`scope`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/th#scope) and [`headers`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/th#headers) attributes.         |
| {{HTMLElement("thead")}}    | Encapsulates a set of table rows ({{HTMLElement("tr")}} elements), indicating that they comprise the head of a table with information about the table's columns. This is usually in the form of column headers ({{HTMLElement("th")}} elements).                                                                       |
| {{HTMLElement("tr")}}       | Defines a row of cells in a table. The row's cells can then be established using a mix of {{HTMLElement("td")}} (data cell) and {{HTMLElement("th")}} (header cell) elements.                                                                                                                                          |

## Forms

HTML provides several elements that can be used together to create forms that the user can fill out and submit to the website or application. Further information about this available in the [HTML forms guide](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms).

| Element                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| {{HTMLElement("button")}}          | An interactive element activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it performs an action, such as submitting a [form](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms) or opening a dialog.                                                                                       |
| {{HTMLElement("datalist")}}        | Contains a set of {{HTMLElement("option")}} elements that represent the permissible or recommended options available to choose from within other controls.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| {{HTMLElement("fieldset")}}        | Used to group several controls as well as labels ({{HTMLElement("label")}}) within a web form.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| {{HTMLElement("form")}}            | Represents a document section containing interactive controls for submitting information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| {{HTMLElement("input")}}           | Used to create interactive controls for web-based forms to accept data from the user; a wide variety of types of input data and control widgets are available, depending on the device and user agent. The `<input>` element is one of the most powerful and complex in all of HTML due to the sheer number of combinations of input types and attributes. |
| {{HTMLElement("label")}}           | Represents a caption for an item in a user interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| {{HTMLElement("legend")}}          | Represents a caption for the content of its parent {{HTMLElement("fieldset")}}.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| {{HTMLElement("meter")}}           | Represents either a scalar value within a known range or a fractional value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| {{HTMLElement("optgroup")}}        | Creates a grouping of options within a {{HTMLElement("select")}} element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| {{HTMLElement("option")}}          | Used to define an item contained in a select, an {{HTMLElement("optgroup")}}, or a {{HTMLElement("datalist")}} element. As such, `<option>` can represent menu items in popups and other lists of items in an HTML document.                                                                                                                               |
| {{HTMLElement("output")}}          | Container element into which a site or app can inject the results of a calculation or the outcome of a user action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| {{HTMLElement("selectedcontent")}} | Displays the content of the currently selected `<option>` inside a closed `<select>` element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| {{HTMLElement("textarea")}}        | Represents a multi-line plain-text editing control, useful when you want to allow users to enter a sizeable amount of free-form text, for example, a comment on a review or feedback form.                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Interactive elements

HTML offers a selection of elements that help to create interactive user interface objects.

| Element                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| {{HTMLElement("details")}} | Creates a disclosure widget in which information is visible only when the widget is toggled into an "open" state. A summary or label must be provided using the {{HTMLElement("summary")}} element.  |
| {{HTMLElement("dialog")}}  | Represents a dialog box or other interactive component, such as a dismissible alert, inspector, or subwindow.                                                                                        |
| {{HTMLElement("summary")}} | Specifies a summary, caption, or legend for a details element's disclosure box. Clicking the `<summary>` element toggles the state of the parent {{HTMLElement("details")}} element open and closed. |

## Web Components

Web Components is an HTML-related technology that makes it possible to, essentially, create and use custom elements as if it were regular HTML. In addition, you can create custom versions of standard HTML elements.

| Element                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| {{HTMLElement("slot")}}     | Part of the [Web Components](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) technology suite, this element is a placeholder inside a web component that you can fill with your own markup, which lets you create separate DOM trees and present them together. |
| {{HTMLElement("template")}} | A mechanism for holding HTML that is not to be rendered immediately when a page is loaded but may be instantiated subsequently during runtime using JavaScript.                                                                                     |

## Obsolete and deprecated elements

> [!WARNING]
> These are old HTML elements that are deprecated and should not be used. **You should never use them in new projects, and you should replace them in old projects as soon as you can.** They are listed here for completeness only.

| Element                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| {{HTMLElement("big")}}       | Renders the enclosed text at a font size one level larger than the surrounding text (`medium` becomes `large`, for example). The size is capped at the browser's maximum permitted font size.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| {{HTMLElement("center")}}    | Displays its block-level or inline contents centered horizontally within its containing element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `<content>`                  | An obsolete part of the [Web Components](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) suite of technologies—was used inside of [Shadow DOM](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM) as an insertion point, and wasn't meant to be used in ordinary HTML. It has now been replaced by the {{HTMLElement("slot")}} element, which creates a point in the DOM at which a shadow DOM can be inserted. Consider using {{HTMLElement("slot")}} instead. |
| {{HTMLElement("dir")}}       | Container for a directory of files and/or folders, potentially with styles and icons applied by the user agent. Do not use this obsolete element; instead, you should use the {{HTMLElement("ul")}} element for lists, including lists of files.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| {{HTMLElement("font")}}      | Defines the font size, color and face for its content.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| {{HTMLElement("frame")}}     | Defines a particular area in which another HTML document can be displayed. A frame should be used within a {{HTMLElement("frameset")}}.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| {{HTMLElement("frameset")}}  | Used to contain {{HTMLElement("frame")}} elements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `<image>`                    | An ancient and poorly supported precursor to the {{HTMLElement("img")}} element. It should not be used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| {{HTMLElement("marquee")}}   | Used to insert a scrolling area of text. You can control what happens when the text reaches the edges of its content area using its attributes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `<menuitem>`                 | Represents a command that a user is able to invoke through a popup menu. This includes context menus, as well as menus that might be attached to a menu button.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| {{HTMLElement("nobr")}}      | Prevents the text it contains from automatically wrapping across multiple lines, potentially resulting in the user having to scroll horizontally to see the entire width of the text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| {{HTMLElement("noembed")}}   | An obsolete, non-standard way to provide alternative, or "fallback", content for browsers that do not support the embed element or do not support the type of [embedded content](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Content_categories#embedded_content) an author wishes to use. This element was deprecated in HTML 4.01 and above in favor of placing fallback content between the opening and closing tags of an {{HTMLElement("object")}} element.      |
| {{HTMLElement("noframes")}}  | Provides content to be presented in browsers that don't support (or have disabled support for) the {{HTMLElement("frame")}} element. Although most commonly-used browsers support frames, there are exceptions, including certain special-use browsers including some mobile browsers, as well as text-mode browsers.                                                                                                                                 |
| {{HTMLElement("param")}}     | Defines parameters for an {{HTMLElement("object")}} element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| {{HTMLElement("plaintext")}} | Renders everything following the start tag as raw text, ignoring any following HTML. There is no closing tag, since everything after it is considered raw text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| {{HTMLElement("rb")}}        | Used to delimit the base text component of a ruby annotation, i.e., the text that is being annotated. One `<rb>` element should wrap each separate atomic segment of the base text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| {{HTMLElement("rtc")}}       | Embraces semantic annotations of characters presented in a ruby of {{HTMLElement("rb")}} elements used inside of {{HTMLElement("ruby")}} element. {{HTMLElement("rb")}} elements can have both pronunciation ({{HTMLElement("rt")}}) and semantic ({{HTMLElement("rtc")}}) annotations.                                                                                                                                                               |
| `<shadow>`                   | An obsolete part of the [Web Components](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) technology suite that was intended to be used as a shadow DOM insertion point. You might have used it if you have created multiple shadow roots under a shadow host. Consider using {{HTMLElement("slot")}} instead.                                                                                                                                                     |
| {{HTMLElement("strike")}}    | Places a strikethrough (horizontal line) over text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| {{HTMLElement("tt")}}        | Creates inline text which is presented using the user agent default monospace font face. This element was created for the purpose of rendering text as it would be displayed on a fixed-width display such as a teletype, text-only screen, or line printer.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| {{HTMLElement("xmp")}}       | Renders text between the start and end tags without interpreting the HTML in between and using a monospaced font. The HTML2 specification recommended that it should be rendered wide enough to allow 80 characters per line.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

{{HTMLElement("input")}} elements of type **`button`** are rendered as push buttons, which can be programmed to control custom functionality anywhere on a webpage as required when assigned an event handler function (typically for the {{domxref("Element/click_event", "click")}} event).

> [!NOTE]
> While `<input>` elements of type `button` are still perfectly valid HTML, the newer {{HTMLElement("button")}} element is now the favored way to create buttons. Given that a {{HTMLElement("button")}}'s label text is inserted between the opening and closing tags, you can include HTML in the label, even images.

## Value

### Button with a value

An `<input type="button">` elements' [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) attribute contains a string that is used as the button's label. The `value` provides the {{glossary("accessible description")}} for the button.

```html
<input type="button" value="Click Me" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Button_with_a_value", 650, 30)}}

### Button without a value

If you don't specify a `value`, you get an empty button:

```html
<input type="button" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Button_without_a_value", 650, 30)}}

## Using buttons

`<input type="button">` elements have no default behavior (their cousins, `<input type="submit">` and [`<input type="reset">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/reset) are used to submit and reset forms, respectively). To make buttons do anything, you have to write JavaScript code to do the work.

### A basic button

We'll begin by creating a basic button with a {{domxref("Element/click_event", "click")}} event handler that starts our machine (well, it toggles the `value` of the button and the text content of the following paragraph):

```html
<form>
  <input type="button" value="Start machine" />
</form>
<p>The machine is stopped.</p>
```

```js
const button = document.querySelector("input");
const paragraph = document.querySelector("p");

button.addEventListener("click", updateButton);

function updateButton() {
  if (button.value === "Start machine") {
    button.value = "Stop machine";
    paragraph.textContent = "The machine has started!";
  } else {
    button.value = "Start machine";
    paragraph.textContent = "The machine is stopped.";
  }
}
```

The script gets a reference to the {{domxref("HTMLInputElement")}} object representing the `<input>` in the DOM, saving this reference in the variable `button`. {{domxref("EventTarget.addEventListener", "addEventListener()")}} is then used to establish a function that will be run when {{domxref("Element/click_event", "click")}} events occur on the button.

{{EmbedLiveSample("A_basic_button", 650, 100)}}

### Adding keyboard shortcuts to buttons

Keyboard shortcuts, also known as access keys and keyboard equivalents, let the user trigger a button using a key or combination of keys on the keyboard. To add a keyboard shortcut to a button — just as you would with any {{HTMLElement("input")}} for which it makes sense — you use the [`accesskey`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/accesskey) global attribute.

In this example, <kbd>s</kbd> is specified as the access key (you'll need to press <kbd>s</kbd> plus the particular modifier keys for your browser/OS combination; see [accesskey](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/accesskey) for a useful list of those).

```html
<form>
  <input type="button" value="Start machine" accesskey="s" />
</form>
<p>The machine is stopped.</p>

> [!NOTE]
> The problem with the above example of course is that the user will not know what the access key is! In a real site, you'd have to provide this information in a way that doesn't interfere with the site design (for example by providing an easily accessible link that points to information on what the site access keys are).

### Disabling and enabling a button

To disable a button, specify the [`disabled`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/disabled) global attribute on it, like so:

```html
<input type="button" value="Disable me" disabled />
```

#### Setting the disabled attribute

You can enable and disable buttons at run time by setting `disabled` to `true` or `false`. In this example our button starts off enabled, but if you press it, it is disabled using `button.disabled = true`. A {{domxref("Window.setTimeout", "setTimeout()")}} function is then used to reset the button back to its enabled state after two seconds.

```html
<input type="button" value="Enabled" />
```

```js
const button = document.querySelector("input");

button.addEventListener("click", disableButton);

function disableButton() {
  button.disabled = true;
  button.value = "Disabled";
  setTimeout(() => {
    button.disabled = false;
    button.value = "Enabled";
  }, 2000);
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Setting_the_disabled_attribute", 650, 60)}}

#### Inheriting the disabled state

If the `disabled` attribute isn't specified, the button inherits its `disabled` state from its parent element. This makes it possible to enable and disable groups of elements all at once by enclosing them in a container such as a {{HTMLElement("fieldset")}} element, and then setting `disabled` on the container.

The example below shows this in action. This is very similar to the previous example, except that the `disabled` attribute is set on the `<fieldset>` when the first button is pressed — this causes all three buttons to be disabled until the two second timeout has passed.

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>Button group</legend>
  <input type="button" value="Button 1" />
  <input type="button" value="Button 2" />
  <input type="button" value="Button 3" />
</fieldset>
```

```js
const button = document.querySelector("input");
const fieldset = document.querySelector("fieldset");

button.addEventListener("click", disableButton);

function disableButton() {
  fieldset.disabled = true;
  setTimeout(() => {
    fieldset.disabled = false;
  }, 2000);
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Inheriting_the_disabled_state", 650, 100)}}

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike other browsers, Firefox persists the `disabled` state of an `<input>` element even after the page is reloaded. As a workaround, set the `<input>` element's [`autocomplete`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#autocomplete) attribute to `off`. (See [Firefox bug 654072](https://bugzil.la/654072) for more details.)

## Validation

Buttons don't participate in constraint validation; they have no real value to be constrained.

## Examples

The below example shows a very basic drawing app created using a {{htmlelement("canvas")}} element and some CSS and JavaScript (we'll hide the CSS for brevity). The top two controls allow you to choose the color and size of the drawing pen. The button, when clicked, invokes a function that clears the canvas.

```html
<div class="toolbar">
  <input type="color" aria-label="select pen color" />
  <input
    type="range"
    min="2"
    max="50"
    value="30"
    aria-label="select pen size" /><span class="output">30</span>
  <input type="button" value="Clear canvas" />
</div>

<canvas class="myCanvas">
  <p>Add suitable fallback here.</p>
</canvas>
```

```css hidden
body {
  background: #cccccc;
  margin: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.toolbar {
  background: #cccccc;
  width: 150px;
  height: 75px;
  padding: 5px;
}

input[type="color"],
input[type="button"] {
  width: 90%;
  margin: 0 auto;
  display: block;
}

input[type="range"] {
  width: 70%;
}

span {
  position: relative;
  bottom: 5px;
}
```

```js
const canvas = document.querySelector(".myCanvas");
const width = (canvas.width = window.innerWidth);
const height = (canvas.height = window.innerHeight - 85);
const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

ctx.fillStyle = "rgb(0 0 0)";
ctx.fillRect(0, 0, width, height);

const colorPicker = document.querySelector('input[type="color"]');
const sizePicker = document.querySelector('input[type="range"]');
const output = document.querySelector(".output");
const clearBtn = document.querySelector('input[type="button"]');

// covert degrees to radians
function degToRad(degrees) {
  return (degrees * Math.PI) / 180;
}

// update size picker output value

sizePicker.oninput = () => {
  output.textContent = sizePicker.value;
};

// store mouse pointer coordinates, and whether the button is pressed
let curX;
let curY;
let pressed = false;

// update mouse pointer coordinates
document.onmousemove = (e) => {
  curX = e.pageX;
  curY = e.pageY;
};

canvas.onmousedown = () => {
  pressed = true;
};

canvas.onmouseup = () => {
  pressed = false;
};

clearBtn.onclick = () => {
  ctx.fillStyle = "rgb(0 0 0)";
  ctx.fillRect(0, 0, width, height);
};

function draw() {
  if (pressed) {
    ctx.fillStyle = colorPicker.value;
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.arc(
      curX,
      curY - 85,
      sizePicker.value,
      degToRad(0),
      degToRad(360),
      false,
    );
    ctx.fill();
  }

  requestAnimationFrame(draw);
}

draw();
```

# <input type="checkbox">

{{htmlelement("input")}} elements of type **`checkbox`** are rendered by default as boxes that are checked (ticked) when activated, like you might see in an official government paper form. The exact appearance depends upon the operating system configuration under which the browser is running. Generally this is a square but it may have rounded corners. A checkbox allows you to select single values for submission in a form (or not).

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot;&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<fieldset>
  <legend>Choose your monster's features:</legend>

  <div>
    <input type="checkbox" id="scales" name="scales" checked />
    <label for="scales">Scales</label>
  </div>

  <div>
    <input type="checkbox" id="horns" name="horns" />
    <label for="horns">Horns</label>
  </div>
</fieldset>
```

```css interactive-example
p,
label {
  font:
    1rem "Fira Sans",
    sans-serif;
}

input {
  margin: 0.4rem;
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> [Radio buttons](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/radio) are similar to checkboxes, but with an important distinction — [same-named radio buttons](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/radio#defining_a_radio_group) are grouped into a set in which only one radio button can be selected at a time, whereas checkboxes allow you to turn single values on and off. Where multiple same-named controls exist, radio buttons allow one to be selected out of them all, whereas checkboxes allow multiple values to be selected.

## Value

A string representing the value of the checkbox. This is not displayed on the client-side, but on the server this is the `value` given to the data submitted with the checkbox's `name`. Take the following example:

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <input
      type="checkbox"
      id="subscribeNews"
      name="subscribe"
      value="newsletter" />
    <label for="subscribeNews">Subscribe to newsletter?</label>
  </div>
  <div>
    <button type="submit">Subscribe</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

In this example, we've got a name of `subscribe`, and a value of `newsletter`. When the form is submitted, the data name/value pair will be `subscribe=newsletter`.

If the `value` attribute was omitted, the default value for the checkbox is `on`, so the submitted data in that case would be `subscribe=on`.

> [!NOTE]
> If a checkbox is unchecked when its form is submitted, neither the name nor the value is submitted to the server. There is no HTML-only method of representing a checkbox's unchecked state (e.g., `value=unchecked`). If you wanted to submit a default value for the checkbox when it is unchecked, you could include JavaScript to create an {{HTMLElement("input/hidden", '&lt;input type="hidden"&gt;')}} within the form with a value indicating an unchecked state.

## Additional attributes

In addition to the [common attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#attributes) shared by all {{HTMLElement("input")}} elements, `checkbox` inputs support the following attributes.

- `checked`
  - : A [boolean](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Boolean/HTML) attribute indicating whether this checkbox is checked by default (when the page loads). It does _not_ indicate whether this checkbox is currently checked: if the checkbox's state is changed, this content attribute does not reflect the change. (Only the {{domxref("HTMLInputElement")}}'s `checked` IDL attribute is updated.)
    > [!NOTE]
    > Unlike other input controls, a checkbox's value is only included in the submitted data if the checkbox is currently `checked`. If it is, then the value of the checkbox's `value` attribute is reported as the input's value, or `on` if no `value` is set.
    > Unlike other browsers, Firefox by default [persists the dynamic checked state](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5985839/bug-with-firefox-disabled-attribute-of-input-not-resetting-when-refreshing) of an `<input>` across page loads. Use the [`autocomplete`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#autocomplete) attribute to control this feature.

- `value`
  - : The `value` attribute is one which all {{HTMLElement("input")}}s share; however, it serves a special purpose for inputs of type `checkbox`: when a form is submitted, only checkboxes which are currently checked are submitted to the server, and the reported value is the value of the `value` attribute. If the `value` is not otherwise specified, it is the string `on` by default. This is demonstrated in the section [Value](#value) above.

## Using checkbox inputs

We already covered the most basic use of checkboxes above. Let's now look at the other common checkbox-related features and techniques you'll need.

### Handling multiple checkboxes

The example we saw above only contained one checkbox; in real-world situations you'll be likely to encounter multiple checkboxes. If they are completely unrelated, then you can just deal with them all separately, as shown above. However, if they're all related, things are not quite so simple.

For example, in the following demo we include multiple checkboxes to allow the user to select their interests (see the full version in the [Examples](#examples) section).

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>Choose your interests</legend>
  <div>
    <input type="checkbox" id="coding" name="interest" value="coding" />
    <label for="coding">Coding</label>
  </div>
  <div>
    <input type="checkbox" id="music" name="interest" value="music" />
    <label for="music">Music</label>
  </div>
</fieldset>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Handling_multiple_checkboxes', 600, 100)}}

In this example you will see that we've given each checkbox the same `name`. If both checkboxes are checked and then the form is submitted, you'll get a string of name/value pairs submitted like this: `interest=coding&interest=music`. When this string reaches the server, you need to parse it other than as an associative array, so all values, not only the last value, of `interest` are captured. For one technique used with Python, see [Handle Multiple Checkboxes with a Single Serverside Variable](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18745456/handle-multiple-checkboxes-with-a-single-serverside-variable), for example.

### Checking boxes by default

To make a checkbox checked by default, you give it the `checked` attribute. See the below example:

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>Choose your interests</legend>
  <div>
    <input type="checkbox" id="coding" name="interest" value="coding" checked />
    <label for="coding">Coding</label>
  </div>
  <div>
    <input type="checkbox" id="music" name="interest" value="music" />
    <label for="music">Music</label>
  </div>
</fieldset>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Checking_boxes_by_default', 600, 100)}}

### Providing a bigger hit area for your checkboxes

In the above examples, you may have noticed that you can toggle a checkbox by clicking on its associated {{htmlelement("label")}} element as well as on the checkbox itself. This is a really useful feature of HTML form labels that makes it easier to click the option you want, especially on small-screen devices like smartphones.

Beyond accessibility, this is another good reason to properly set up `<label>` elements on your forms.

### Indeterminate state checkboxes

A checkbox can be in an **indeterminate** state. This is set using the {{domxref("HTMLInputElement")}} object's [`indeterminate`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/indeterminate) property via JavaScript (it cannot be set using an HTML attribute):

```js
inputInstance.indeterminate = true;
```

When `indeterminate` is `true`, the checkbox has a horizontal line in the box (it looks somewhat like a hyphen or minus sign) instead of a check/tick in most browsers.

> [!NOTE]
> This is purely a visual change. It has no impact on whether the checkbox's `value` is used in a form submission. That is decided by the `checked` state, regardless of the `indeterminate` state.

There are not many use cases for this property. The most common is when a checkbox is available that "owns" a number of sub-options (which are also checkboxes). If all of the sub-options are checked, the owning checkbox is also checked, and if they're all unchecked, the owning checkbox is unchecked. If any one or more of the sub-options have a different state than the others, the owning checkbox is in the indeterminate state.

This can be seen in the below example (thanks to [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/indeterminate-checkboxes/) for the inspiration). In this example we keep track of the ingredients we are collecting for a recipe. When you check or uncheck an ingredient's checkbox, a JavaScript function checks the total number of checked ingredients:

- If none are checked, the recipe name's checkbox is set to unchecked.
- If one or two are checked, the recipe name's checkbox is set to `indeterminate`.
- If all three are checked, the recipe name's checkbox is set to `checked`.

So in this case the `indeterminate` state is used to state that collecting the ingredients has started, but the recipe is not yet complete.

```js
const overall = document.querySelector("#enchantment");
const ingredients = document.querySelectorAll("ul input");

overall.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
});

for (const ingredient of ingredients) {
  ingredient.addEventListener("click", updateDisplay);
}

function updateDisplay() {
  let checkedCount = 0;
  for (const ingredient of ingredients) {
    if (ingredient.checked) {
      checkedCount++;
    }
  }

  if (checkedCount === 0) {
    overall.checked = false;
    overall.indeterminate = false;
  } else if (checkedCount === ingredients.length) {
    overall.checked = true;
    overall.indeterminate = false;
  } else {
    overall.checked = false;
    overall.indeterminate = true;
  }
}
```

{{EmbedGHLiveSample("learning-area/html/forms/indeterminate-example/index.html", '100%', 200)}}

## Validation

Checkboxes do support [validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation) (offered to all {{HTMLElement("input")}}s). However, most of the {{domxref("ValidityState")}}s will always be `false`. If the checkbox has the [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#required) attribute, but is not checked, then {{domxref("ValidityState.valueMissing")}} will be `true`.

## Examples

The following example is an extended version of the "multiple checkboxes" example we saw above — it has more standard options, plus an "other" checkbox that when checked causes a text field to appear to enter a value for the "other" option. This is achieved with a short block of JavaScript. The example includes implicit labels, with the `<input>` directly inside the `<label>`. The text input, without a visible label, includes the [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) attribute which provides its accessible name. This example also includes some CSS to improve the styling.

  <fieldset>

# <input type="color">

{{HTMLElement("input")}} elements of type **`color`** provide a user interface element that lets a user specify a color, either by using a visual color picker interface or by entering the color into a text field in a [CSS color value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) format.

The element's presentation may vary substantially from one browser and/or platform to another—it might be a basic textual input that automatically validates to ensure that the color information is entered in the proper format, or a platform-standard color picker, or some kind of custom color picker window.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;input type=&quot;color&quot;&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<p>Choose your colors:</p>

<div>
  <input type="color" id="foreground" name="foreground" value="#e66465" />
  <label for="foreground">Foreground color</label>
</div>

<div>
  <input
    type="color"
    id="background"
    name="background"
    value="oklab(50% 0.1 0.1 / 0.5)"
    colorspace="display-p3"
    alpha />
  <label for="background">Background color</label>
</div>
```

```css interactive-example
p,
label {
  font:
    1rem "Fira Sans",
    sans-serif;
}

input {
  margin: 0.4rem;
}
```

## Value

A [CSS color value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value).

> [!NOTE]
> Historically, only basic hexadecimal colors (without alpha channel) were allowed. Now, any CSS color format, including named colors, functional notations, and hexadecimal colors with an alpha channel, can be used. The default value is `#000000` (black) if a `value` is omitted or is invalid.

## Additional attributes

In addition to the [global attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes) and the [input attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#attributes) common to all {{HTMLElement("input")}} elements, the `color` input also supports the following attributes:

- `alpha` {{experimental_inline}}
  - : A [boolean](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Boolean/HTML) attribute, if present, indicates the color's alpha component can be manipulated by the end user and does not have to be fully opaque.

- `colorspace` {{experimental_inline}}
  - : Defines the {{glossary("color space")}} for the color and hints at the desired user interface for the color picker widget. Possible {{Glossary("enumerated")}} values are:
    - `"limited-srgb"`: The color is in the {{glossary("RGB", "sRGB")}} color space. This includes [`rgb()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/rgb), [`hsl()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl), [`hwb()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hwb), and {{cssxref("hex-color")}} values. The color value is limited to 8-bits per `r`, `g`, and `b` component. This is the default.
    - `"display-p3"`: The [Display P3 color space](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Color_space#display-p3), e.g., `color(display-p3 1.84 -0.19 0.72 / 0.6)`

## Using color inputs

Inputs of type `color` are simple, due to the limited number of attributes they support.

### Providing a default color

You can update the example above to set a default value, so that the color picker is pre-filled with the default color and the color picker (if any) will also default to that color.

```html
<input type="color" value="#ff0000" />
<input
  type="color"
  id="body"
  name="body"
  value="oklab(50% 0.1 0.1 / 0.5)"
  colorspace="display-p3"
  alpha />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Providing_a_default_color", 700, 30)}}

If you don't specify a value or if the value is invalid or otherwise not supported by the browser, the value defaults to `#000000`, which is opaque black.

### Tracking color changes

As is the case with other {{HTMLElement("input")}} types, there are two events that can be used to detect changes to the color value: {{domxref("Element/input_event", "input")}} and {{domxref("HTMLElement/change_event", "change")}}. `input` is fired on the `<input>` element every time the color changes. The `change` event is fired when the user dismisses the color picker. In both cases, you can determine the new value of the element by looking at its [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value).

Here's an example that watches changes over time to the color value:

```js
colorPicker.addEventListener("input", updateFirst);
colorPicker.addEventListener("change", watchColorPicker);

function watchColorPicker(event) {
  document.querySelectorAll("p").forEach((p) => {
    p.style.color = event.target.value;
  });
}
```

### Selecting the value

When a browser doesn't support a color picker interface, its implementation of color inputs will be a text box that validates the contents automatically to ensure that the value is in the correct format. In this case you can use the {{domxref("HTMLInputElement.select", "select()")}} method to select the text currently in the edit field.

If the browser instead uses a color picker, `select()` does nothing. You should be aware of this behavior so your code can respond appropriately in either case.

```js
colorPicker.select();
```

## Validation

A color input's value is considered to be invalid if the {{Glossary("user agent")}} is unable to convert the user's input into seven-character lower-case hexadecimal notation. If and when this is the case, the {{cssxref(":invalid")}} pseudo-class is applied to the element.

## Example

Let's create an example which does a little more with the color input by tracking the {{domxref("HTMLElement/change_event", "change")}} and {{domxref("Element/input_event", "input")}} events to take the new color and apply it to every {{HTMLElement("p")}} element in the document.

### HTML

The HTML is fairly straightforward — a couple of paragraphs of descriptive material with an {{HTMLElement("input")}} of type `color` with the ID `color-picker`, which we'll use to change the color of the paragraphs' text.

```html
<p>
  An example demonstrating the use of the
  <code>&lt;input type="color"&gt;</code> control.
</p>

<label for="color-picker">Color:</label>
<input type="color" value="#ff0000" id="color-picker" />

<p>
  Watch the paragraph colors change when you adjust the color picker. As you
  make changes in the color picker, the first paragraph's color changes, as a
  preview (this uses the <code>input</code> event). When you close the color
  picker, the <code>change</code> event fires, and we detect that to change
  every paragraph to the selected color.
</p>
```

### JavaScript

#### Initialization

The following code initializes the color input:

```js
const defaultColor = "#0000ff";
const colorPicker = document.querySelector("#color-picker");
colorPicker.value = defaultColor;
colorPicker.addEventListener("input", updateFirst);
colorPicker.addEventListener("change", updateAll);
colorPicker.select();
```

This gets a reference to the color `<input>` element in a variable called `colorPicker`, then sets the color input's value to the value in `defaultColor`. Then the color input's {{domxref("Element/input_event", "input")}} event is set up to call our `updateFirst()` function, and the {{domxref("HTMLElement/change_event", "change")}} event is set to call `updateAll()`. These are both seen below.

Finally, we call {{domxref("HTMLInputElement.select", "select()")}} to select the text content of the color input if the control is implemented as a text field (this has no effect if a color picker interface is provided instead).

#### Reacting to color changes

We provide two functions that deal with color changes. The `updateFirst()` function is called in response to the `input` event. It changes the color of the first paragraph element in the document to match the new value of the color input. Since `input` events are fired every time an adjustment is made to the value (for example, if the brightness of the color is increased), these will happen repeatedly as the color picker is used.

```js
function updateFirst(event) {
  const p = document.querySelector("p");
  if (p) {
    p.style.color = event.target.value;
  }
}
```

When the color picker is dismissed, indicating that the value will not change again (unless the user re-opens the color picker), a `change` event is sent to the element. We handle that event using the `updateAll()` function, using [`Event.target.value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) to obtain the final selected color:

```js
function updateAll(event) {
  document.querySelectorAll("p").forEach((p) => {
    p.style.color = event.target.value;
  });
}
```

This sets the color of every {{HTMLElement("p")}} block so that its {{cssxref("color")}} attribute matches the current value of the color input, which is referred to using {{domxref("Event.target", "event.target")}}.

### Result

The final result looks like this:

# <input type="date">

{{HTMLElement("input")}} elements of **`type="date"`** create input fields that let the user enter a date. The appearance of the date picker input UI varies based on the browser and operating system. The value is normalized to the format `yyyy-mm-dd`.

The resulting value includes the year, month, and day, but _not_ the time. The {{HTMLElement("input/time", "time")}} and {{HTMLElement("input/datetime-local", "datetime-local")}} input types support time and date+time input.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;input type=&quot;date&quot;&gt;", "tabbed-shorter")}}

```html interactive-example
<label for="start">Start date:</label>

<input
  type="date"
  id="start"
  name="trip-start"
  value="2018-07-22"
  min="2018-01-01"
  max="2018-12-31" />
```

```css interactive-example
label {
  display: block;
  font:
    1rem "Fira Sans",
    sans-serif;
}

input,
label {
  margin: 0.4rem 0;
}
```

## Value

A string representing the date entered in the input. The date is formatted according to [Date strings format](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Date_and_time_formats#date_strings).

You can set a default value for the input with a date inside the [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) attribute, like so:

```html
<input type="date" value="2017-06-01" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Value', 600, 40)}}

> [!NOTE]
> The displayed date format will differ from the actual `value` — the displayed date is formatted _based on the locale of the user's browser_, but the parsed `value` is always formatted `yyyy-mm-dd`.

You can get and set the date value in JavaScript with the {{domxref("HTMLInputElement")}} `value` and `valueAsNumber` properties. For example:

```js
const dateControl = document.querySelector('input[type="date"]');
dateControl.value = "2017-06-01";
console.log(dateControl.value); // prints "2017-06-01"
console.log(dateControl.valueAsNumber); // prints 1496275200000, a JavaScript timestamp (ms)
```

This code finds the first {{HTMLElement("input")}} element whose `type` is `date`, and sets its value to `2017-06-01` (June 1st, 2017). It then reads that value back in string and number formats.

## Additional attributes

In addition to [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes) and the [input attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#attributes) common to all {{HTMLElement("input")}} elements, the `date` input supports the following attributes:

### max

The latest date to accept. If the [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) entered into the element occurs afterward, the element fails [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation). If the value of the `max` attribute isn't a possible date string in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`, then the element has no maximum date value.

If both the `max` and `min` attributes are set, this value must be a date string **later than or equal to** the one in the `min` attribute.

### min

The earliest date to accept. If the [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) entered into the element occurs beforehand, the element fails [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation). If the value of the `min` attribute isn't a possible date string in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`, then the element has no minimum date value.

If both the `max` and `min` attributes are set, this value must be a date string **earlier than or equal to** the one in the `max` attribute.

### step

The `step` attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to, or the special value `any`, which is described below. Only values which are a whole number of steps from the step base are valid. The step base is [`min`](#min) if specified, [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) otherwise, or `0` (the Unix epoch, `1970-01-01`) if neither is provided.

For `date` inputs, the value of `step` is given in days and is treated as a number of milliseconds equal to 86,400,000 times the `step` value (the underlying numeric value is in milliseconds). The default value is 1, indicating 1 day.

A string value of `any` means that no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as [`min`](#min) and [`max`](#max)). In reality, it has the same effect as `1` for `date` inputs because the picker UI only allows selecting whole days.

> [!NOTE]
> When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping configuration, the {{Glossary("user agent")}} may round to the nearest valid value, preferring numbers in the positive direction when there are two equally close options.

## Using date inputs

Date inputs provide an easy interface for choosing dates, and they normalize the data format sent to the server regardless of the user's locale.

In this section, we'll look at basic and then more complex uses of `<input type="date">`.

### Basic uses of date

The most basic use of `<input type="date">` involves one `<input>` combined with its {{htmlelement("label")}}, as seen below:

```html
<form action="https://example.com">
  <label>
    Enter your birthday:
    <input type="date" name="bday" />
  </label>

  <p><button>Submit</button></p>
</form>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Basic_uses_of_date', 600, 40)}}

This HTML submits the entered date under the key `bday` to `https://example.com` — resulting in a URL like `https://example.com/?bday=1955-06-08`.

### Setting maximum and minimum dates

You can use the [`min`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#min) and [`max`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#max) attributes to restrict the dates that can be chosen by the user. In the following example, we set a minimum date of `2017-04-01` and a maximum date of `2017-04-30`:

```html
<form>
  <label>
    Choose your preferred party date:
    <input type="date" name="party" min="2017-04-01" max="2017-04-30" />
  </label>
</form>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Setting_maximum_and_minimum_dates', 600, 40)}}

The result is that only days in April 2017 can be selected — the month and year parts of the textbox will be uneditable, and dates outside April 2017 can't be selected in the picker widget.

You can use the [`step`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#step) attribute to vary the number of days jumped each time the date is incremented (e.g., to only make Saturdays selectable).

### Controlling input size

`<input type="date">` doesn't support form sizing attributes such as [`size`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#size). Prefer [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) for sizing it.

## Validation

By default, `<input type="date">` doesn't validate the entered value beyond its format. The interfaces generally don't let you enter anything that isn't a date — which is helpful.

If you use [`min`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#min) and [`max`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#max) to restrict the available dates (see [Setting maximum and minimum dates](#setting_maximum_and_minimum_dates)), the form control disables invalid dates, and will display an error if you try to submit a date that is out of bounds.

You can also use the [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#required) attribute to make filling in the date mandatory — an error will be displayed if you try to submit an empty date field.

Let's look at an example of minimum and maximum dates, and also make a field required:

```html
<form>
  <label>
    Choose your preferred party date (required, April 1st to 20th):
    <input
      type="date"
      name="party"
      min="2017-04-01"
      max="2017-04-20"
      required />
    <span class="validity"></span>
  </label>

  <p>
    <button>Submit</button>
  </p>
</form>
```

If you try to submit the form with an incomplete date (or with a date outside the set bounds), the browser displays an error. Try playing with the example now:

{{EmbedLiveSample('Validation', 600, 100)}}

Here's the CSS used in the above example. We make use of the {{cssxref(":valid")}} and {{cssxref(":invalid")}} [pseudo-elements](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements) to add an icon next to the input, based on whether the current value is valid. We had to put the icon on a {{htmlelement("span")}} next to the input, not on the input itself, because in Chrome at least the input's generated content is placed inside the form control, and can't be styled or shown effectively.

```css
label {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
}

span::after {
  padding-left: 5px;
}

input:invalid + span::after {
  content: "✖";
}

input:valid + span::after {
  content: "✓";
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> Client-side form validation _is not a substitute_ for validating on the server. It's easy for someone to modify the HTML, or bypass your HTML entirely and submit the data directly to your server. If your server fails to validate the received data, disaster could strike with data that is badly-formatted, too large, of the wrong type, etc.

## Examples

In this example, we create a date picker using the native `<input type="date">` picker.

### HTML

The HTML looks like so:

```html
<form>
  <div class="nativeDatePicker">
    <label for="bday">Enter your birthday:</label>
    <input type="date" id="bday" name="bday" />
    <span class="validity"></span>
  </div>
</form>
```

### CSS

The CSS looks like so:

```css
input:invalid + span::after {
  content: " ✖";
}

input:valid + span::after {
  content: " ✓";
}
```

# <input type="datetime-local">

{{htmlelement("input")}} elements of type **`datetime-local`** create input controls that let the user easily enter both a date and a time, including the year, month, and day as well as the time in hours and minutes.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;input type=&quot;datetime-local&quot;&gt;", "tabbed-shorter")}}

```html interactive-example
<label for="meeting-time">Choose a time for your appointment:</label>

<input
  type="datetime-local"
  id="meeting-time"
  name="meeting-time"
  value="2018-06-12T19:30"
  min="2018-06-07T00:00"
  max="2018-06-14T00:00" />
```

```css interactive-example
label {
  display: block;
  font:
    1rem "Fira Sans",
    sans-serif;
}

input,
label {
  margin: 0.4rem 0;
}
```

The control's UI varies in general from browser to browser. The control is intended to represent _a local date and time_, not necessarily _the user's local date and time_. In other words, the input allows any valid combination of year, month, day, hour, and minute—even if such a combination is invalid in the user's local time zone (such as the one hour within a daylight saving time spring-forward transition gap).

## Value

A string representing the value of the date entered into the input. The format of the date and time value used by this input type is described in [Local date and time strings](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Date_and_time_formats#local_date_and_time_strings).

You can set a default value for the input by including a date and time inside the [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) attribute, like so:

```html
<label for="party">Enter a date and time for your party booking:</label>
<input
  id="party"
  type="datetime-local"
  name="party-date"
  value="2017-06-01T08:30" />
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Value', 600, 60) }}

One thing to note is that the displayed date and time formats differ from the actual `value`; the displayed date and time are formatted according to the user's locale as reported by their operating system, whereas the date/time `value` is always formatted `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm`. When the above value is submitted to the server, for example, it will look like `party-date=2024-06-01T08:30`.

> [!NOTE]
> Also bear in mind that if such data is submitted via HTTP [`GET`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/GET), the colon character will need to be escaped for inclusion in the URL parameters, e.g., `party-date=2024-06-01T08%3A30`. See {{jsxref("Global_Objects/encodeURI", "encodeURI()")}} for one way to do this.

You can also get and set the date value in JavaScript using the {{domxref("HTMLInputElement")}} `value` property, for example:

```js
const dateControl = document.querySelector('input[type="datetime-local"]');
dateControl.value = "2017-06-01T08:30";
```

## Additional attributes

In addition to the attributes common to all {{HTMLElement("input")}} elements, `datetime-local` inputs offer the following attributes.

### max

The latest date and time to accept. If the [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) entered into the element is later than this timestamp, the element fails [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation). If the value of the `max` attribute isn't a valid string that follows the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm`, then the element has no maximum value.

This value must specify a date string later than or equal to the one specified by the `min` attribute.

### min

The earliest date and time to accept; timestamps earlier than this will cause the element to fail [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation). If the value of the `min` attribute isn't a valid string that follows the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm`, then the element has no minimum value.

This value must specify a date string earlier than or equal to the one specified by the `max` attribute.

### step

The `step` attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to, or the special value `any`, which is described below. Only values which are a whole number of steps from the step base are valid. The step base is [`min`](#min) if specified, [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) otherwise, or `0` (the Unix epoch, `1970-01-01T00:00`) if neither is provided.

For `datetime-local` inputs, the value of `step` is given in seconds and is treated as a number of milliseconds equal to 1000 times the `step` value (the underlying numeric value is in milliseconds). The default value is 60, indicating 1 minute.

A string value of `any` means that no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as [`min`](#min) and [`max`](#max)). In reality, it has the same effect as `60` for `datetime-local` inputs because the picker UI in this case only allows selecting whole minutes.

> [!NOTE]
> When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping configuration, the {{Glossary("user agent")}} may round to the nearest valid value, preferring numbers in the positive direction when there are two equally close options.

## Using datetime-local inputs

Date/time inputs are convenient for the developer; they provide an easy UI for choosing dates and times, and they normalize the data format sent to the server, regardless of the user's locale. However, it is important to consider your users. Don't require your users to enter data that is not needed for your app to function.

### Controlling input size

`<input type="datetime-local">` doesn't support form control sizing attributes such as [`size`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#size). You'll have to resort to [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) for customizing the sizes of these elements.

### Setting timezones

One thing the `datetime-local` input type doesn't provide is a way to set the time zone and/or locale of the date/time control. This was available in the `datetime` input type, but this type is now obsolete, having been removed from the spec. The main reasons why this was removed are a lack of implementation in browsers and concerns over the user interface/experience. It is easier to just have a control (or controls) for setting the date/time and then deal with the locale in a separate control.

For example, if you are creating a system where the user is likely to already be logged in, with their locale already set, you could provide the timezone in a [`hidden`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/hidden) input type. For example:

```html
<input type="hidden" id="timezone" name="timezone" value="-08:00" />
```

On the other hand, if you were required to allow the user to enter a time zone along with a date/time input, you could have a {{htmlelement("select")}} element to enable the user to set the right time zone by choosing a particular location from among a set of locations:

```html
<select name="timezone" id="timezone">
  <option value="Pacific/Kwajalein">Eniwetok, Kwajalein</option>
  <option value="Pacific/Midway">Midway Island, Samoa</option>
  <option value="Pacific/Honolulu">Hawaii</option>
  <option value="Pacific/Marquesas">Taiohae</option>
  <!-- and so on -->
</select>
```

In either case, the date/time and time zone values would be submitted to the server as separate data points, and then you'd need to store them appropriately in the database on the server-side.

## Validation

By default, `<input type="datetime-local">` does not apply any validation to entered values. The UI implementations generally don't let you enter anything that isn't a date/time — which is helpful — but a user might still fill in no value and submit, or enter an invalid date and/or time (e.g., the 32nd of April).

You can use [`min`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#min) and [`max`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#max) to restrict the available dates (see [Setting maximum and minimum dates](#setting_maximum_and_minimum_dates_and_times)), and you can use the [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#required) attribute to make filling in the date/time mandatory. As a result, browsers will display an error if you try to submit a date that is outside the set bounds or an empty date field.

Let's look at an example; here we've set minimum and maximum date/time values, and also made the field required:

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <label for="party">
      Choose your preferred party date and time (required, June 1st 8.30am to
      June 30th 4.30pm):
    </label>
    <input
      id="party"
      type="datetime-local"
      name="party-date"
      min="2017-06-01T08:30"
      max="2017-06-30T16:30"
      required />
    <span class="validity"></span>
  </div>
  <div>
    <input type="submit" value="Book party!" />
  </div>
</form>
```

If you try to submit the form with an incomplete date (or with a date outside the set bounds), the browser displays an error. Try playing with the example now:

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Validation', 600, 120) }}

Here's the CSS used in the above example. Here we make use of the {{cssxref(":valid")}} and {{cssxref(":invalid")}} CSS properties to style the input based on whether the current value is valid. We put the icons on a {{htmlelement("span")}} next to the input.

```css
div {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
}

label {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 300px;
}

input:invalid + span::after {
  content: "✖";
  padding-left: 5px;
}

input:valid + span::after {
  content: "✓";
  padding-left: 5px;
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> HTML form validation is _not_ a substitute for scripts that ensure that the entered data is in the proper format. It's far too easy for someone to make adjustments to the HTML that allow them to bypass the validation, or to remove it entirely. It's also possible for someone to bypass your HTML entirely and submit the data directly to your server. If your server-side code fails to validate the data it receives, problems can arise when improperly-formatted data is submitted (or data that is too large, is of the wrong type, and so forth).

> [!NOTE]
> With a `datetime-local` input, the date value is always normalized to the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm`.

## Examples

### Basic uses of datetime-local

The most basic use of `<input type="datetime-local">` involves a basic `<input>` and {{htmlelement("label")}} element combination, as seen below:

```html
<form>
  <label for="party">Enter a date and time for your party booking:</label>
  <input id="party" type="datetime-local" name="party-date" />
</form>
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Basic_uses_of_datetime-local', 600, 40) }}

### Setting maximum and minimum dates and times

You can use the [`min`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#min) and [`max`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#max) attributes to restrict the dates/times that can be chosen by the user. In the following example, we are setting a minimum datetime of `2025-06-01T08:30` and a maximum datetime of `2025-06-30T16:30`:

```html
<form>
  <label for="party">Enter a date and time for your party booking:</label>
  <input
    id="party"
    type="datetime-local"
    name="party-date"
    min="2025-06-01T08:30"
    max="2025-06-30T16:30" />
</form>
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Setting_maximum_and_minimum_dates_and_times', 600, 40) }}

Only days in June 2025 can be selected. Depending on what browser you are using, times outside the specified values might not be selectable. In other browsers, invalid dates and times are selectable but will match {{CSSXref(":invalid")}} and {{CSSXref(":out-of-range")}} and will fail [validation](#validation).

In some browsers (Chrome and Edge), only the "days" part of the date value will be editable, and dates outside June can't be scrolled. In others (Safari), the date picker will appear to allow any date, but the value will be clamped to the valid range when a date is selected.

The valid range included all times between the `min` and `max` values; the time of day is only constrained on the first and last dates in the range.

> [!NOTE]
> You should be able to use the [`step`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#step) attribute to vary the number of days jumped each time the date is incremented (e.g., maybe you only want to make Saturdays selectable). However, this does not seem to work effectively in any implementation at the time of writing.

# <input type="email">

{{HTMLElement("input")}} elements of type **`email`** are used to let the user enter and edit an email address, or, if the [`multiple`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/multiple) attribute is specified, a list of email addresses.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;input type=&quot;email&quot;&gt;", "tabbed-shorter")}}

```html interactive-example
<label for="email">Enter your example.com email:</label>

<input type="email" id="email" pattern=".+@example\.com" size="30" required />
```

```css interactive-example
label {
  display: block;
  font:
    1rem "Fira Sans",
    sans-serif;
}

input,
label {
  margin: 0.4rem 0;
}
```

The input value is automatically validated to ensure that it's either empty or a properly-formatted email address (or list of addresses) before the form can be submitted. The {{cssxref(":valid")}} and {{cssxref(":invalid")}} CSS pseudo-classes are automatically applied as appropriate to visually denote whether the current value of the field is a valid email address or not.

## Value

The {{HTMLElement("input")}} element's [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) attribute contains a string which is automatically validated as conforming to email syntax. More specifically, there are three possible value formats that will pass validation:

1. An empty string ("") indicating that the user did not enter a value or that the value was removed.
2. A single properly-formed email address. This doesn't necessarily mean the email address exists, but it is at least formatted correctly. This means `username@domain` or `username@domain.tld`. There's more to it than that, of course; see [Validation](#validation) for a {{Glossary("regular expression")}} that matches the email address validation algorithm.
3. If and only if the [`multiple`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#multiple) attribute is specified, the value can be a list of properly-formed comma-separated email addresses. Any trailing and leading whitespace is removed from each address in the list.

See [Validation](#validation) for details on how email addresses are validated to ensure that they're formatted properly.

## Additional attributes

In addition to the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes), and the attributes that operate on all {{HTMLElement("input")}} elements regardless of their type, `email` inputs support the following attributes.

> [!NOTE]
> The [`autocorrect`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/autocorrect) global attribute can be added to email inputs, but the stored state is always `off`.

### list

The values of the list attribute is the {{domxref("Element.id", "id")}} of a {{HTMLElement("datalist")}} element located in the same document. The {{HTMLElement("datalist")}} provides a list of predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in the list that are not compatible with the [`type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#type) are not included in the suggested options. The values provided are suggestions, not requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a different value.

### maxlength

The maximum string length (measured in {{glossary("UTF-16", "UTF-16 code units")}}) that the user can enter into the `email` input. This must be an integer value of 0 or higher. If no `maxlength` is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the `email` input has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of `minlength`.

The input will fail [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation) if the length of the text value of the field is greater than `maxlength` {{glossary("UTF-16", "UTF-16 code units")}} long. Constraint validation is only applied when the value is changed by the user.

### minlength

The minimum string length (measured in {{glossary("UTF-16", "UTF-16 code units")}}) that the user can enter into the `email` input. This must be a non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by `maxlength`. If no `minlength` is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the `email` input has no minimum length.

The input will fail [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation) if the length of the text entered into the field is fewer than `minlength` {{glossary("UTF-16", "UTF-16 code units")}} long. Constraint validation is only applied when the value is changed by the user.

### multiple

A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user can enter a list of multiple email addresses, separated by commas and, optionally, whitespace characters. See [Allowing multiple email addresses](#allowing_multiple_email_addresses) for an example, or [HTML attribute: multiple](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/multiple) for more details.

> [!NOTE]
> Normally, if you specify the [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#required) attribute, the user must enter a valid email address for the field to be considered valid. However, if you add the `multiple` attribute, a list of zero email addresses (an empty string, or one which is entirely whitespace) is a valid value. In other words, the user does not have to enter even one email address when `multiple` is specified, regardless of the value of `required`.

### pattern

The `pattern` attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input's [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) must match for the value to pass [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation). It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the {{jsxref("RegExp")}} type, and as documented in our [guide on regular expressions](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions); the `'u'` flag is specified when compiling the regular expression so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as {{Glossary("ASCII")}}. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text.

If the specified pattern is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely.

> [!NOTE]
> Use the [`title`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#title) attribute to specify text that most browsers will display as a tooltip to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern. You should also include other explanatory text nearby.

See the section [Pattern validation](#pattern_validation) for details and an example.

### `placeholder`

The `placeholder` attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of data, rather than an explanatory message. The text _must not_ include carriage returns or line feeds.

If the control's content has one directionality ({{Glossary("LTR")}} or {{Glossary("RTL")}}) but needs to present the placeholder in the opposite directionality, you can use Unicode bidirectional algorithm formatting characters to override directionality within the placeholder; see [How to use Unicode controls for bidi text](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-unicode-controls) for more information.

> [!NOTE]
> Avoid using the `placeholder` attribute if you can. It is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See [`<input>` labels](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#labels) for more information.

### `readonly`

A Boolean attribute which, if present, means this field cannot be edited by the user. Its `value` can, however, still be changed by JavaScript code directly setting the {{domxref("HTMLInputElement")}} `value` property.

> [!NOTE]
> Because a read-only field cannot have a value, `required` does not have any effect on inputs with the `readonly` attribute also specified.

### `size`

The `size` attribute is a numeric value indicating how many characters wide the input field should be. The value must be a number greater than zero, and the default value is 20. Since character widths vary, this may or may not be exact and should not be relied upon to be so; the resulting input may be narrower or wider than the specified number of characters, depending on the characters and the font ({{cssxref("font")}} settings in use).

This does _not_ set a limit on how many characters the user can enter into the field. It only specifies approximately how many can be seen at a time. To set an upper limit on the length of the input data, use the [`maxlength`](#maxlength) attribute.

## Using email inputs

Email addresses are among the most frequently-inputted textual data forms on the web; they're used when logging into websites, when requesting information, to allow order confirmation, for webmail, and so forth. As such, the `email` input type can make your job as a web developer much easier since it can help simplify your work when building the user interface and logic for email addresses. When you create an email input with the proper `type` value, `email`, you get automatic validation that the entered text is at least in the correct form to potentially be a legitimate email address. This can help avoid cases in which the user mistypes their address, or provides an invalid address.

It's important, however, to note that this is not enough to ensure that the specified text is an email address which actually exists, corresponds to the user of the site, or is acceptable in any other way. It ensures that the value of the field is properly formatted to be an email address.

> [!NOTE]
> It's also crucial to remember that a user can tinker with your HTML behind the scenes, so your site _must not_ use this validation for any security purposes. You _must_ verify the email address on the server side of any transaction in which the provided text may have any security implications of any kind.

### A basic email input

Currently, all browsers which implement this element implement it as a standard text input field with basic validation features. The specification does, however, allow browsers latitude on this. For example, the element could be integrated with the user's device's built-in address book to allow picking email addresses from that list. In its most basic form, an `email` input can be implemented like this:

```html
<input id="emailAddress" type="email" />
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('A_basic_email_input', 600, 40) }}

Notice that it's considered valid when empty and when a single validly-formatted email address is entered, but is otherwise not considered valid. By adding the [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#required) attribute, only validly-formed email addresses are allowed; the input is no longer considered valid when empty.

### Allowing multiple email addresses

By adding the [`multiple`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/multiple) Boolean attribute, the input can be configured to accept multiple email addresses.

```html
<input id="emailAddress" type="email" multiple />
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Allowing multiple email addresses', 600, 40) }}

The input is now considered valid when a single email address is entered, or when any number of email addresses separated by commas and, optionally, some number of whitespace characters are present.

> [!NOTE]
> When `multiple` is used, the value _is_ allowed to be empty.

Some examples of valid strings when `multiple` is specified:

- `""`
- `"me@example"`
- `"me@example.org"`
- `"me@example.org,you@example.org"`
- `"me@example.org, you@example.org"`
- `"me@example.org,you@example.org, us@example.org"`

Some examples of invalid strings:

- `","`
- `"me"`
- `"me@example.org you@example.org"`

### Placeholders

Sometimes it's helpful to offer an in-context hint as to what form the input data should take. This can be especially important if the page design doesn't offer descriptive labels for each {{HTMLElement("input")}}. This is where **placeholders** come in. A placeholder is a value that demonstrates the form the `value` should take by presenting an example of a valid value, which is displayed inside the edit box when the element's `value` is "". Once data is entered into the box, the placeholder disappears; if the box is emptied, the placeholder reappears.

Here, we have an `email` input with the placeholder `sophie@example.com`. Note how the placeholder disappears and reappears as you manipulate the contents of the edit field.

```html
<input type="email" placeholder="sophie@example.com" />
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Placeholders', 600, 40) }}

### Controlling the input size

You can control not only the physical length of the input box, but also the minimum and maximum lengths allowed for the input text itself.

#### Physical input element size

The physical size of the input box can be controlled using the [`size`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#size) attribute. With it, you can specify the number of characters the input box can display at a time. In this example the `email` edit box is 15 characters wide:

```html
<input type="email" size="15" />
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Physical_input_element_size', 600, 40) }}

#### Element value length

The `size` is separate from the length limitation on the entered email address itself so that you can have fields fit in a small space while still allowing longer email address strings to be entered. You can specify a minimum length, in characters, for the entered email address using the [`minlength`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#minlength) attribute; similarly, use [`maxlength`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#maxlength) to set the maximum length of the entered email address.

The example below creates a 32 character-wide email address entry box, requiring that the contents be no shorter than 3 characters and no longer than 64 characters.

```html
<input type="email" size="32" minlength="3" maxlength="64" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Element_value_length", 600, 40) }}

### Providing default options

#### Providing a single default using the value attribute

As always, you can provide a default value for an `email` input box by setting its [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) attribute:

```html
<input type="email" value="default@example.com" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Providing_a_single_default_using_the_value_attribute", 600, 40)}}

#### Offering suggested values

Taking it a step further, you can provide a list of default options from which the user can select by specifying the [`list`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#list) attribute. This doesn't limit the user to those options, but does allow them to select commonly-used email addresses more quickly. This also offers hints to [`autocomplete`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#autocomplete). The `list` attribute specifies the ID of a {{HTMLElement("datalist")}}, which in turn contains one {{HTMLElement("option")}} element per suggested value; each `option`'s `value` is the corresponding suggested value for the email entry box.

```html
<input type="email" size="40" list="defaultEmails" />

<datalist id="defaultEmails">
  <option value="jbond007@mi6.defence.gov.uk"></option>
  <option value="jbourne@unknown.net"></option>
  <option value="nfury@shield.org"></option>
  <option value="tony@starkindustries.com"></option>
  <option value="hulk@grrrrrrrr.arg"></option>
</datalist>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Offering_suggested_values", 600, 40)}}

With the {{HTMLElement("datalist")}} element and its {{HTMLElement("option")}}s in place, the browser will offer the specified values as potential values for the email address; this is typically presented as a popup or drop-down menu containing the suggestions. While the specific user experience may vary from one browser to another, typically clicking in the edit box presents a drop-down of the suggested email addresses. Then, as the user types, the list is filtered to show only matching values. Each typed character narrows down the list until the user makes a selection or types a custom value.

## Validation

There are two levels of content validation available for `email` inputs. First, there's the standard level of validation offered to all {{HTMLElement("input")}}s, which automatically ensures that the contents meet the requirements to be a valid email address. But there's also the option to add additional filtering to ensure that your own specialized needs are met, if you have any.

> [!WARNING]
> HTML form validation is _not_ a substitute for scripts that ensure that the entered data is in the proper format. It's far too easy for someone to make adjustments to the HTML that allow them to bypass the validation, or to remove it completely. It's also possible for someone to bypass your HTML entirely and submit the data directly to your server. If your server-side code fails to validate the data it receives, disaster could strike when improperly-formatted data (or data which is too large, is of the wrong type, and so forth) is entered into your database.

### Basic validation

Browsers automatically provide validation to ensure that only text that matches the standard format for Internet email addresses is entered into the input box. Browsers use an algorithm equivalent to the following regular expression:

```js
/^[\w.!#$%&'*+/=?^`{|}~-]+@[a-z\d](?:[a-z\d-]{0,61}[a-z\d])?(?:\.[a-z\d](?:[a-z\d-]{0,61}[a-z\d])?)*$/i;
```

To learn more about how form validation works and how to take advantage of the {{cssxref(":valid")}} and {{cssxref(":invalid")}} CSS properties to style the input based on whether the current value is valid, see [Form data validation](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Form_validation).

> [!NOTE]
> There are known specification issues related to international domain names and the validation of email addresses in HTML. See [W3C bug 15489](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=15489) for details.

### Pattern validation

If you need the entered email address to be restricted further than just "any string that looks like an email address," you can use the [`pattern`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#pattern) attribute to specify a {{Glossary("regular expression")}} the value must match for it to be valid. If the [`multiple`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#multiple) attribute is specified, each individual item in the comma-delineated list of values must match the {{Glossary("regular expression")}}.

For example, let's say you're building a page for employees of Best Startup Ever, Inc. which will let them contact their IT department for help. In our simplified form, the user needs to enter their email address and a message describing the problem they need help with. We want to ensure that not only does the user provide a valid email address, but for security purposes, we require that the address be an internal corporate email address.

Since inputs of type `email` validate against both the standard email address validation _and_ the specified [`pattern`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#pattern), you can implement this easily. Let's see how:

```css hidden
body {
  font: 16px sans-serif;
}

.emailBox {
  padding-bottom: 20px;
}

.messageBox {
  padding-bottom: 20px;
}

label {
  line-height: 22px;
}

label::after {
  content: ":";
}
```

```html
<form>
  <div class="emailBox">
    <label for="emailAddress">Your email address</label><br />
    <input
      id="emailAddress"
      type="email"
      size="64"
      maxlength="64"
      required
      placeholder="username@beststartupever.com"
      pattern=".+@beststartupever\.com"
      title="Please provide only a Best Startup Ever corporate email address" />
  </div>

  <div class="messageBox">
    <label for="message">Request</label><br />
    <textarea
      id="message"
      cols="80"
      rows="8"
      required
      placeholder="My shoes are too tight, and I have forgotten how to dance."></textarea>
  </div>
  <input type="submit" value="Send Request" />
</form>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Pattern_validation", 700, 300)}}

Our {{HTMLElement("form")}} contains one {{HTMLElement("input")}} of type `email` for the user's email address, a {{HTMLElement("textarea")}} to enter their message for IT into, and an `<input>` of type [`"submit"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/submit), which creates a button to submit the form. Each text entry box has a {{HTMLElement("label")}} associated with it to let the user know what's expected of them.

Let's take a closer look at the email address entry box. Its [`size`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#size) and [`maxlength`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#maxlength) attributes are both set to 64 in order to show room for 64 characters worth of email address, and to limit the number of characters actually entered to a maximum of 64. The [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#required) attribute is specified, making it mandatory that a valid email address be provided.

An appropriate [`placeholder`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#placeholder) is provided—`username@beststartupever.com`—to demonstrate what constitutes a valid entry. This string demonstrates both that an email address should be entered, and suggests that it should be a corporate beststartupever.com account. This is in addition to the fact that using type `email` will validate the text to ensure that it's formatted like an email address. If the text in the input box isn't an email address, you'll get an error message that looks something like this:

![Invalid email address in error state with a popout from the input reading 'please enter an email address'.](enter-valid-email-address.png)

If we left things at that, we would at least be validating on legitimate email addresses. But we want to go one step farther: we want to make sure that the email address is in fact in the form `[username]@beststartupever.com`. This is where we'll use [`pattern`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#pattern). We set `pattern` to `.+@beststartupever.com`. This regular expression requests a string that consists of at least one character of any kind, then an "@" followed by the domain name "beststartupever.com".

Note that this is not even close to an adequate filter for valid email addresses; it would allow things such as " @beststartupever.com" (note the leading space) or "@@beststartupever.com", neither of which is valid. However, the browser runs both the standard email address filter _and_ our custom pattern against the specified text. As a result, we wind up with a validation which says "make sure this resembles a valid email address, and if it is, make sure it's also a beststartupever.com address."

It's advisable to use the [`title`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/title) attribute along with `pattern`. If you do, the `title` _must_ describe the pattern. That is, it should explain what format the data should take on, rather than any other information. That's because the `title` may be displayed or spoken as part of a validation error message. For example, the browser might present the message "The entered text doesn't match the required pattern." followed by your specified `title`. If your `title` is something like "Email address", the result would be the message "The entered text doesn't match the required pattern. Email address", which isn't very good.

That's why, instead, we specify the string "Please provide only a Best Startup Ever corporate email address" By doing that, the resulting full error message might be something like "The entered text doesn't match the required pattern. Please provide only a Best Startup Ever corporate email address."

![A valid email address, but the input is in error state with a popout from the input reading 'The entered text doesn't match the required pattern. Please provide only a Best Startup Ever corporate email address.'](email-pattern-match-bad.png)

> [!NOTE]
> If you run into trouble while writing your validation regular expressions and they're not working properly, check your browser's console; there may be helpful error messages there to aid you in solving the problem.

## Examples

Here we have an email input with the ID `emailAddress` which is allowed to be up to a maximum of 256 characters long. The input box itself is physically 64 characters wide, and displays the text `user@example.gov` as a placeholder anytime the field is empty. In addition, by using the [`multiple`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/multiple) attribute, the box is configured to allow the user to enter zero or more email addresses, separated by commas, as described in [Allowing multiple email addresses](#allowing_multiple_email_addresses). As a final touch, the [`list`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#list) attribute contains the ID of a {{HTMLElement("datalist")}} whose {{HTMLElement("option")}}s specify a set of suggested values the user can choose from.

As an added touch, the {{HTMLElement("label")}} element is used to establish a label for the email entry box, with its [`for`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/label#for) attribute referencing the `emailAddress` ID of the {{HTMLElement("input")}} element. By associating the two elements in this way, clicking on the label will focus the input element.

```html
<label for="emailAddress">Email</label><br />
<input
  id="emailAddress"
  type="email"
  placeholder="user@example.gov"
  list="defaultEmails"
  size="64"
  maxlength="256"
  multiple />

<datalist id="defaultEmails">
  <option value="jbond007@mi6.defence.gov.uk"></option>
  <option value="jbourne@unknown.net"></option>
  <option value="nfury@shield.org"></option>
  <option value="tony@starkindustries.com"></option>
  <option value="hulk@grrrrrrrr.arg"></option>
</datalist>
```

# <input type="file">

{{HTMLElement("input")}} elements with **`type="file"`** let the user choose one or more files from their device storage. Once chosen, the files can be uploaded to a server using [form submission](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms), or manipulated using JavaScript code and [the File API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_API/Using_files_from_web_applications).

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt;", "tabbed-shorter")}}

```html interactive-example
<label for="avatar">Choose a profile picture:</label>

<input type="file" id="avatar" name="avatar" accept="image/png, image/jpeg" />
```

```css interactive-example

  display: block;
  font:
    1rem "Fira Sans",
    sans-serif;
}

input,

  margin: 0.4rem 0;
}
```

## Value

A file input's [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) attribute contains a string that represents the path to the selected file(s). If no file is selected yet, the value is an empty string (`""`). When the user selected multiple files, the `value` represents the first file in the list of files they selected. The other files can be identified using the [input's `HTMLInputElement.files` property](/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_API/Using_files_from_web_applications#getting_information_about_selected_files).

> [!NOTE]
> The value is [always the file's name prefixed with `C:\fakepath\`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#fakepath-srsly), which isn't the real path of the file. This is to prevent malicious software from guessing the user's file structure.

## Additional attributes

In addition to the common attributes shared by all {{HTMLElement("input")}} elements, inputs of type `file` also support the following attributes.

### accept

The [`accept`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/accept) attribute value is a string that defines the file types the file input should accept. This string is a comma-separated list of **[unique file type specifiers](#unique_file_type_specifiers)**. Because a given file type may be identified in more than one manner, it's useful to provide a thorough set of type specifiers when you need files of a given format.

For instance, there are a number of ways Microsoft Word files can be identified, so a site that accepts Word files might use an `<input>` like this:

```html
<input
  type="file"
  id="docpicker"
  accept=".doc,.docx,.xml,application/msword,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" />
```

### capture

The [`capture`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/capture) attribute value is a string that specifies which camera to use for capture of image or video data, if the [`accept`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/accept) attribute indicates that the input should be of one of those types. A value of `user` indicates that the user-facing camera and/or microphone should be used. A value of `environment` specifies that the outward-facing camera and/or microphone should be used. If this attribute is missing, the {{Glossary("user agent")}} is free to decide on its own what to do. If the requested facing mode isn't available, the user agent may fall back to its preferred default mode.

> [!NOTE]
> `capture` was previously a Boolean attribute which, if present, requested that the device's media capture device(s) such as camera or microphone be used instead of requesting a file input.

### multiple

When the [`multiple`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/multiple) Boolean attribute is specified, the file input allows the user to select more than one file.

## Non-standard attributes

In addition to the attributes listed above, the following non-standard attributes are available on some browsers. You should try to avoid using them when possible, since doing so will limit the ability of your code to function in browsers that don't implement them.

### `webkitdirectory`

The Boolean `webkitdirectory` attribute, if present, indicates that only directories should be available to be selected by the user in the file picker interface. See {{domxref("HTMLInputElement.webkitdirectory")}} for additional details and examples.

## Unique file type specifiers

A **unique file type specifier** is a string that describes a type of file that may be selected by the user in an {{HTMLElement("input")}} element of type `file`. Each unique file type specifier may take one of the following forms:

- A valid case-insensitive filename extension, starting with a period (".") character. For example: `.jpg`, `.pdf`, or `.doc`.
- A valid MIME type string, with no extensions.
- The string `audio/*` meaning "any audio file".
- The string `video/*` meaning "any video file".
- The string `image/*` meaning "any image file".

The `accept` attribute takes a string containing one or more of these unique file type specifiers as its value, separated by commas. For example, a file picker that needs content that can be presented as an image, including both standard image formats and PDF files, might look like this:

```html
<input type="file" accept="image/*,.pdf" />
```

## Using file inputs

### A basic example

```html
<form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <div>
    <label for="file">Choose file to upload</label>
    <input type="file" id="file" name="file" multiple />
  </div>
  <div>
    <button>Submit</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

```css hidden
div {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}
```

This produces the following output:

{{EmbedLiveSample('A_basic_example', 650, 90)}}

> [!NOTE]
> You can find this example on GitHub too — see the [source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/forms/file-examples/simple-file.html), and also [see it running live](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/forms/file-examples/simple-file.html).

Regardless of the user's device or operating system, the file input provides a button that opens up a file picker dialog that allows the user to choose a file.

Including the [`multiple`](#multiple) attribute, as shown above, specifies that multiple files can be chosen at once. The user can choose multiple files from the file picker in any way that their chosen platform allows (e.g., by holding down <kbd>Shift</kbd> or <kbd>Control</kbd> and then clicking). If you only want the user to choose a single file per `<input>`, omit the `multiple` attribute.

### Getting information on selected files

The selected files' are returned by the element's `HTMLInputElement.files` property, which is a {{domxref("FileList")}} object containing a list of {{domxref("File")}} objects. The `FileList` behaves like an array, so you can check its `length` property to get the number of selected files.

Each `File` object contains the following information:

- `name`
  - : The file's name.
- `lastModified`
  - : A number specifying the date and time at which the file was last modified, in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch (January 1, 1970, at midnight).
- `lastModifiedDate` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : A {{jsxref("Date")}} object representing the date and time at which the file was last modified. _This is deprecated and should not be used. Use `lastModified` instead._
- `size`
  - : The size of the file in bytes.
- `type`
  - : The file's [MIME type](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/MIME_types).
- `webkitRelativePath` {{non-standard_inline}}
  - : A string specifying the file's path relative to the base directory selected in a directory picker (that is, a `file` picker in which the [`webkitdirectory`](#webkitdirectory) attribute is set). _This is non-standard and should be used with caution._

### Limiting accepted file types

Often you won't want the user to be able to pick any arbitrary type of file; instead, you often want them to select files of a specific type or types. For example, if your file input lets users upload a profile picture, you probably want them to select web-compatible image formats, such as {{Glossary("JPEG")}} or {{Glossary("PNG")}}.

Acceptable file types can be specified with the [`accept`](#accept) attribute, which takes a comma-separated list of allowed file extensions or MIME types. Some examples:

- `accept="image/png"` or `accept=".png"` — Accepts PNG files.
- `accept="image/png, image/jpeg"` or `accept=".png, .jpg, .jpeg"` — Accept PNG or JPEG files.
- `accept="image/*"` — Accept any file with an `image/*` MIME type. (Many mobile devices also let the user take a picture with the camera when this is used.)
- `accept=".doc,.docx,.xml,application/msword,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"` — accept anything that smells like an MS Word document.

Let's look at a more complete example:

```html
<form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <div>
    <label for="profile_pic">Choose file to upload</label>
    <input
      type="file"
      id="profile_pic"
      name="profile_pic"
      accept=".jpg, .jpeg, .png" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <button>Submit</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

```css hidden
div {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}
```

This produces a similar-looking output to the previous example:

{{EmbedLiveSample('Limiting_accepted_file_types', 650, 90)}}

> [!NOTE]
> You can find this example on GitHub too — see the [source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/forms/file-examples/file-with-accept.html), and also [see it running live](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/forms/file-examples/file-with-accept.html).

It may look similar, but if you try selecting a file with this input, you'll see that the file picker only lets you select the file types specified in the `accept` value (the exact interface differs across browsers and operating systems).

The `accept` attribute doesn't validate the types of the selected files; it provides hints for browsers to guide users towards selecting the correct file types. It is still possible (in most cases) for users to toggle an option in the file chooser that makes it possible to override this and select any file they wish, and then choose incorrect file types.

Because of this, you should make sure that the `accept` attribute is backed up by appropriate server-side validation.

### Detecting cancellations

The `cancel` event is fired when the user does not change their selection, reselecting the previously selected files. The `cancel` event is also fired when the file picker dialog gets closed, or canceled, via the "cancel" button or the <kbd>escape</kbd> key.

For example, the following code will log to the console if the user closes the popup without selecting a file:

```js
const elem = document.createElement("input");
elem.type = "file";
elem.addEventListener("cancel", () => {
  console.log("Cancelled.");
});
elem.addEventListener("change", () => {
  if (elem.files.length === 1) {
    console.log("File selected: ", elem.files[0]);
  }
});
elem.click();
```

### Notes

1. You cannot set the value of a file picker from a script — doing something like the following has no effect:

   ```js
   const input = document.querySelector("input[type=file]");
   input.value = "foo";
   ```

2. When a file is chosen using an `<input type="file">`, the real path to the source file is not shown in the input's `value` attribute for obvious security reasons. Instead, the filename is shown, with `C:\fakepath\` prepended to it. There are some historical reasons for this quirk, but it is supported across all modern browsers, and in fact is [defined in the spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#fakepath-srsly).

## Examples

In this example, we'll present a slightly more advanced file chooser that takes advantage of the file information available in the `HTMLInputElement.files` property, as well as showing off a few clever tricks.

> [!NOTE]
> You can see the complete source code for this example on GitHub — [file-example.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/forms/file-examples/file-example.html) ([see it live also](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/forms/file-examples/file-example.html)). We won't explain the CSS; the JavaScript is the main focus.

First of all, let's look at the HTML:

```html
<form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <div>
    <label for="image_uploads">Choose images to upload (PNG, JPG)</label>
    <input
      type="file"
      id="image_uploads"
      name="image_uploads"
      accept=".jpg, .jpeg, .png"
      multiple />
  </div>
  <div class="preview">
    <p>No files currently selected for upload</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <button>Submit</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

```css hidden
html {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

form {
  background: #cccccc;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

form ol {
  padding-left: 0;
}

form li,
div > p {
  background: #eeeeee;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  list-style-type: none;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

form img {
  height: 64px;
  order: 1;
}

form p {
  line-height: 32px;
  padding-left: 10px;
}

form label,
form button {
  background-color: #7f9ccb;
  padding: 5px 10px;
  border-radius: 5px;
  border: 1px ridge black;
  font-size: 0.8rem;
  height: auto;
}

form label:hover,
form button:hover {
  background-color: #2d5ba3;
  color: white;
}

form label:active,
form button:active {
  background-color: #0d3f8f;
  color: white;
}
```

This is similar to what we've seen before — nothing special to comment on.

Next, let's walk through the JavaScript.

In the first lines of script, we get references to the form input itself, and the {{htmlelement("div")}} element with the class of `.preview`. Next, we hide the {{htmlelement("input")}} element — we do this because file inputs tend to be ugly, difficult to style, and inconsistent in their design across browsers. You can activate the `input` element by clicking its {{htmlelement("label")}}, so it is better to visually hide the `input` and style the label like a button, so the user will know to interact with it if they want to upload files.

```js
const input = document.querySelector("input");
const preview = document.querySelector(".preview");

input.style.opacity = 0;
```

> [!NOTE]
> {{cssxref("opacity")}} is used to hide the file input instead of {{cssxref("visibility", "visibility: hidden")}} or {{cssxref("display", "display: none")}}, because assistive technology interprets the latter two styles to mean the file input isn't interactive.

Next, we add an [event listener](/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) to the input to listen for changes to its selected value (in this case, when files are selected). The event listener invokes our custom `updateImageDisplay()` function.

```js
input.addEventListener("change", updateImageDisplay);
```

Whenever the `updateImageDisplay()` function is invoked, we:

- Use a {{jsxref("Statements/while", "while")}} loop to empty the previous contents of the preview `<div>`.
- Grab the {{domxref("FileList")}} object that contains the information on all the selected files, and store it in a variable called `curFiles`.
- Check to see if no files were selected, by checking if `curFiles.length` is equal to 0. If so, print a message into the preview `<div>` stating that no files have been selected.
- If files _have_ been selected, we loop through each one, printing information about it into the preview `<div>`. Things to note here:
- We use the custom `validFileType()` function to check whether the file is of the correct type (e.g., the image types specified in the `accept` attribute).
- If it is, we:
  - Print out its name and file size into a list item inside the previous `<div>` (obtained from `file.name` and `file.size`). The custom `returnFileSize()` function returns a nicely-formatted version of the size in bytes/KB/MB (by default the browser reports the size in absolute bytes).
  - Generate a thumbnail preview of the image by calling {{domxref("URL/createObjectURL_static", "URL.createObjectURL(file)")}}. Then, insert the image into the list item too by creating a new {{htmlelement("img")}} and setting its [`src`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/img#src) to the thumbnail.

- If the file type is invalid, we display a message inside a list item telling the user that they need to select a different file type.

```js
function updateImageDisplay() {
  while (preview.firstChild) {
    preview.removeChild(preview.firstChild);
  }

  const curFiles = input.files;
  if (curFiles.length === 0) {
    const para = document.createElement("p");
    para.textContent = "No files currently selected for upload";
    preview.appendChild(para);
  } else {
    const list = document.createElement("ol");
    preview.appendChild(list);

    for (const file of curFiles) {
      const listItem = document.createElement("li");
      const para = document.createElement("p");
      if (validFileType(file)) {
        para.textContent = `File name ${file.name}, file size ${returnFileSize(
          file.size,
        )}.`;
        const image = document.createElement("img");
        image.src = URL.createObjectURL(file);
        image.alt = image.title = file.name;

        listItem.appendChild(image);
        listItem.appendChild(para);
      } else {
        para.textContent = `File name ${file.name}: Not a valid file type. Update your selection.`;
        listItem.appendChild(para);
      }

      list.appendChild(listItem);
    }
  }
}
```

The custom `validFileType()` function takes a {{domxref("File")}} object as a parameter, then uses {{jsxref("Array.prototype.includes()")}} to check if any value in the `fileTypes` matches the file's `type` property. If a match is found, the function returns `true`. If no match is found, it returns `false`.

```js
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Image_types
const fileTypes = [
  "image/apng",
  "image/bmp",
  "image/gif",
  "image/jpeg",
  "image/pjpeg",
  "image/png",
  "image/svg+xml",
  "image/tiff",
  "image/webp",
  "image/x-icon",
];

function validFileType(file) {
  return fileTypes.includes(file.type);
}
```

The `returnFileSize()` function takes a number (of bytes, taken from the current file's `size` property), and turns it into a nicely formatted size in bytes/KB/MB.

```js
function returnFileSize(number) {
  if (number < 1e3) {
    return `${number} bytes`;
  } else if (number >= 1e3 && number < 1e6) {
    return `${(number / 1e3).toFixed(1)} KB`;
  }
  return `${(number / 1e6).toFixed(1)} MB`;
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The "KB" and "MB" units here use the [SI prefix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix) convention of 1KB = 1000B, similar to macOS. Different systems represent file sizes differently—for example, Ubuntu uses IEC prefixes where 1KiB = 1024B, while RAM specifications often use SI prefixes to represent powers of two (1KB = 1024B). For this reason, we used `1e3` (`1000`) and `1e6` (`100000`) instead of `1024` and `1048576`. In your application, you should communicate the unit system clearly to your users if the exact size is important.

```js hidden
const button = document.querySelector("form button");
button.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const para = document.createElement("p");
  para.append("Image uploaded!");
  preview.replaceChildren(para);
});
```

The example looks like this; have a play:

- [Using files from web applications](/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_API/Using_files_from_web_applications) — contains a number of other useful examples related to `<input type="file">` and the [File API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/File).
# <input type="hidden">

{{HTMLElement("input")}} elements of type **`hidden`** let web developers include data that cannot be seen or modified by users when a form is submitted. For example, the ID of the content that is currently being ordered or edited, or a unique security token. Hidden inputs are completely invisible in the rendered page, and there is no way to make it visible in the page's content.

> [!NOTE]
> The {{domxref("Element/input_event", "input")}} and {{domxref("HTMLElement/change_event", "change")}} events do not apply to this input type. Hidden inputs cannot be focused even using JavaScript (e.g., `hiddenInput.focus()`).

## Value

The {{HTMLElement("input")}} element's [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) attribute holds a string that contains the hidden data you want to include when the form is submitted to the server. This specifically can't be edited or seen by the user via the user interface, although you could edit the value via browser developer tools.

> [!WARNING]
> While the value isn't displayed to the user in the page's content, it is visible—and can be edited—using any browser's developer tools or "View Source" functionality. Do not rely on `hidden` inputs as a form of security.

## Additional attributes

In addition to the attributes common to all {{HTMLElement("input")}} elements, `hidden` inputs offer the following attributes.

### name

This is actually one of the common attributes, but it has a special meaning available for hidden inputs. Normally, the [`name`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#name) attribute functions on hidden inputs just like on any other input. However, when the form is submitted, a hidden input whose `name` is set to `_charset_` will automatically be reported with the value set to the character encoding used to submit the form.

## Using hidden inputs

As mentioned above, hidden inputs can be used anywhere that you want to include data the user can't see or edit along with the form when it's submitted to the server. Let's look at some examples that illustrate its use.

### Tracking edited content

One of the most common uses for hidden inputs is to keep track of what database record needs to be updated when an edit form is submitted. A typical workflow looks like this:

1. User decides to edit some content they have control over, such as a blog post, or a product entry. They get started by pressing the edit button.
2. The content to be edited is taken from the database and loaded into an HTML form to allow the user to make changes.
3. After editing, the user submits the form, and the updated data is sent back to the server to be updated in the database.

The idea here is that during step 2, the ID of the record being updated is kept in a hidden input. When the form is submitted in step 3, the ID is automatically sent back to the server with the record content. The ID lets the site's server-side component know exactly which record needs to be updated with the submitted data.

You can see a full example of what this might look like in the [Examples](#examples) section below.

### Improving website security

Hidden inputs are also used to store and submit security tokens or _secrets_, for the purposes of improving website security. The basic idea is that if a user is filling in a sensitive form, such as a form on their banking website to transfer some money to another account, the secret they would be provided with would prove that they are who they say they are, and that they are using the correct form to submit the transfer request.

This would stop a malicious user from creating a fake form, pretending to be a bank, and emailing the form to unsuspecting users to trick them into transferring money to the wrong place. This kind of attack is called a [Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side/First_steps/Website_security#cross-site_request_forgery_csrf); pretty much any reputable server-side framework uses hidden secrets to prevent such attacks.

> [!NOTE]
> Placing the secret in a hidden input doesn't inherently make it secure. The key's composition and encoding would do that. The value of the hidden input is that it keeps the secret associated with the data and automatically includes it when the form is sent to the server. You need to use well-designed secrets to actually secure your website.

## Validation

Hidden inputs don't participate in constraint validation; they have no real value to be constrained.

## Examples

Let's look at how we might implement a version of the edit form we described earlier (see [Tracking edited content](#tracking_edited_content)), using a hidden input to remember the ID of the record being edited.

The edit form's HTML might look a bit like this:

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <label for="title">Post title:</label>
    <input type="text" id="title" name="title" value="My excellent blog post" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="content">Post content:</label>
    <textarea id="content" name="content" cols="60" rows="5">
This is the content of my excellent blog post. I hope you enjoy it!
    </textarea>
  </div>
  <div>
    <button type="submit">Update post</button>
  </div>
  <input type="hidden" id="postId" name="postId" value="34657" />
</form>
```

Let's also add some CSS:

```css
html {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

form {
  width: 500px;
}

div {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

label {
  flex: 2;
  line-height: 2;
  text-align: right;
  padding-right: 20px;
}

input,
textarea {
  flex: 7;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 1.1rem;
  padding: 5px;
}

textarea {
  height: 60px;
}
```

The server would set the value of the hidden input with the ID `postID` to the ID of the post in its database before sending the form to the user's browser and would use that information when the form is returned to know which database record to update with modified information. No scripting is needed in the content to handle this.

The output looks like this:

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Examples', '100%', 200) }}

> [!NOTE]
> You can also find the example on GitHub (see the [source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/forms/hidden-input-example/index.html), and also [see it running live](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/forms/hidden-input-example/index.html)).

When submitted, the form data sent to the server will look something like this:

`title=My+excellent+blog+post&content=This+is+the+content+of+my+excellent+blog+post.+I+hope+you+enjoy+it!&postId=34657`

Even though the hidden input cannot be seen at all, its data is still submitted.

- {{HTMLElement("input")}} and the {{domxref("HTMLInputElement")}} interface it's based upon
# <input type="image">

{{HTMLElement("input")}} elements of type **`image`** are used to create graphical submit buttons, i.e., submit buttons that take the form of an image rather than text.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;input type=&quot;image&quot;&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<p>Sign in to your account:</p>

<div>
  <label for="userId">User ID</label>
  <input type="text" id="userId" name="userId" />
</div>

<input
  type="image"
  id="image"
  alt="Login"
  src="/shared-assets/images/examples/login-button.png" />
```

```css interactive-example
label {
  font-size: 0.8rem;
}

label,
input[type="image"] {
  margin-top: 1rem;
}

input[type="image"] {
  width: 80px;
}
```

## Value

`<input type="image">` elements do not accept `value` attributes. The path to the image to be displayed is specified in the `src` attribute.

## Additional attributes

In addition to the attributes shared by all {{HTMLElement("input")}} elements, `image` button inputs support the following attributes.

### alt

The `alt` attribute provides an alternate string to use as the button's label if the image cannot be shown (due to error, a {{Glossary("user agent")}} that cannot or is configured not to show images, or if the user is using a screen reading device). If provided, it must be a non-empty string appropriate as a label for the button.

For example, if you have a graphical button that shows an image with an icon and/or image text "Login Now", you should also set the `alt` attribute to something like `Login Now`.

> [!NOTE]
> While the `alt` attribute is technically optional, you should always include one to maximize the usability of your content.

Functionally, the `alt` attribute of the `<input type="image">` element works just like the [`alt`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/img#alt) attribute on {{HTMLElement("img")}} elements.

### formaction

A string indicating the URL to which to submit the data. This takes precedence over the [`action`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#action) attribute on the {{HTMLElement("form")}} element that owns the {{HTMLElement("input")}}.

This attribute is also available on [`<input type="submit">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/submit) and {{HTMLElement("button")}} elements.

### formenctype

A string that identifies the encoding method to use when submitting the form data to the server. There are three permitted values:

- `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
  - : This, the default value, sends the form data as a string after {{Glossary("Percent-encoding", "percent-encoding")}} the text using an algorithm such as {{jsxref("encodeURI", "encodeURI()")}}.
- `multipart/form-data`
  - : Uses the {{domxref("FormData")}} API to manage the data, allowing for files to be submitted to the server. You _must_ use this encoding type if your form includes any {{HTMLElement("input")}} elements of [`type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#type) `file` ([`<input type="file">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/file)).
- `text/plain`
  - : Plain text; mostly useful only for debugging, so you can easily see the data that's to be submitted.

If specified, the value of the `formenctype` attribute overrides the owning form's [`action`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#action) attribute.

This attribute is also available on [`<input type="submit">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/submit) and {{HTMLElement("button")}} elements.

### formmethod

A string indicating the HTTP method to use when submitting the form's data; this value overrides any [`method`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#method) attribute given on the owning form. Permitted values are:

- `get`
  - : A URL is constructed by starting with the URL given by the `formaction` or [`action`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#action) attribute, appending a question mark ("?") character, then appending the form's data, encoded as described by `formenctype` or the form's [`enctype`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#enctype) attribute. This URL is then sent to the server using an HTTP {{HTTPMethod("get")}} request. This method works well for forms that contain only {{Glossary("ASCII")}} characters and have no side effects. This is the default value.
- `post`
  - : The form's data is included in the body of the request that is sent to the URL given by the `formaction` or [`action`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#action) attribute using an HTTP {{HTTPMethod("post")}} request. This method supports complex data and file attachments.
- `dialog`
  - : This method is used to indicate that the button closes the dialog with which the input is associated, and does not transmit the form data at all.

This attribute is also available on [`<input type="submit">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/submit) and {{HTMLElement("button")}} elements.

### formnovalidate

A Boolean attribute which, if present, specifies that the form should not be validated before submission to the server. This overrides the value of the [`novalidate`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#novalidate) attribute on the element's owning form.

This attribute is also available on [`<input type="submit">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/submit) and {{HTMLElement("button")}} elements.

### formtarget

A string which specifies a name or keyword that indicates where to display the response received after submitting the form. The string must be the name of a **browsing context** (that is, a tab, window, or {{HTMLElement("iframe")}}. A value specified here overrides any target given by the [`target`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#target) attribute on the {{HTMLElement("form")}} that owns this input.

In addition to the actual names of tabs, windows, or inline frames, there are a few special keywords that can be used:

- `_self`
  - : Loads the response into the same browsing context as the one that contains the form. This will replace the current document with the received data. This is the default value used if none is specified.
- `_blank`
  - : Loads the response into a new, unnamed, browsing context. This is typically a new tab in the same window as the current document, but may differ depending on the configuration of the {{Glossary("user agent")}}.
- `_parent`
  - : Loads the response into the parent browsing context of the current one. If there is no parent context, this behaves the same as `_self`.
- `_top`
  - : Loads the response into the top-level browsing context; this is the browsing context that is the topmost ancestor of the current context. If the current context is the topmost context, this behaves the same as `_self`.

This attribute is also available on [`<input type="submit">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/submit) and {{HTMLElement("button")}} elements.

### height

A number specifying the height, in CSS pixels, at which to draw the image specified by the `src` attribute.

### src

A string specifying the URL of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. When the user interacts with the image, the input is handled like any other button input.

### width

A number indicating the width at which to draw the image, in CSS pixels.

## Obsolete attributes

The following attribute was defined by HTML 4 for `image` inputs, but was not implemented by all browsers and has since been deprecated.

### usemap

If `usemap` is specified, it must be the name of an image map element, {{HTMLElement("map")}}, that defines an image map to use with the image. This usage is obsolete; you should switch to using the {{HTMLElement("img")}} element when you want to use image maps.

## Using image inputs

The `<input type="image">` element is a {{ glossary("replaced elements", "replaced element")}} (an element whose content isn't generated or directly managed by the CSS layer), behaving in much the same way as a regular {{htmlelement("img")}} element, but with the capabilities of a [submit button](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/submit).

### Essential image input features

Let's look at a basic example that includes all the essential features you'd need to use (These work exactly the same as they do on the `<img>` element.):

```html
<input
  id="image"
  type="image"
  width="100"
  height="30"
  alt="Login"
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/learning-area/master/html/forms/image-type-example/login.png" />
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Essential_image_input_features', 600, 50) }}

- The [`src`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#src) attribute is used to specify the path to the image you want to display in the button.
- The [`alt`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#alt) attribute provides alt text for the image, so screen reader users can get a better idea of what the button is used for. It will also display if the image can't be shown for any reason (for example if the path is misspelled). If possible, use text which matches the label you'd use if you were using a standard submit button.
- The [`width`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#width) and [`height`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#height) attributes are used to specify the width and height the image should be shown at, in pixels. The button is the same size as the image; if you need the button's hit area to be bigger than the image, you will need to use CSS (e.g., {{cssxref("padding")}}). Also, if you specify only one dimension, the other is automatically adjusted so that the image maintains its original {{glossary("aspect ratio")}}.

### Overriding default form behaviors

`<input type="image">` elements — like regular [submit buttons](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/submit) — can accept a number of attributes that override the default form behavior:

- `formaction`
  - : The URI of a program that processes the information submitted by the input element; overrides the [`action`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#action) attribute of the element's form owner.
- `formenctype`
  - : Specifies the type of content that is used to submit the form to the server. Possible values are:
    - `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`: The default value if the attribute is not specified.
    - `text/plain`.

    If this attribute is specified, it overrides the [`enctype`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#enctype) attribute of the element's form owner.

- `formmethod`
  - : Specifies the HTTP method that the browser uses to submit the form. Possible values are:
    - `post`: The data from the form is included in the body of the form and is sent to the server.
    - `get`: The data from the form is appended to the **`form`** attribute URI, with a '?' as a separator, and the resulting URI is sent to the server. Use this method when the form has no side effects and contains only ASCII characters.

    If specified, this attribute overrides the [`method`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#method) attribute of the element's form owner.

- `formnovalidate`
  - : A Boolean attribute specifying that the form is not to be validated when it is submitted. If this attribute is specified, it overrides the [`novalidate`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#novalidate) attribute of the element's form owner.
- `formtarget`
  - : A name or keyword indicating where to display the response that is received after submitting the form. This is a name of, or keyword for, a _browsing context_ (for example, tab, window, or inline frame). If this attribute is specified, it overrides the [`target`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#target) attribute of the element's form owner. The following keywords have special meanings:
    - `_self`: Load the response into the same browsing context as the current one. This value is the default if the attribute is not specified.
    - `_blank`: Load the response into a new unnamed browsing context.
    - `_parent`: Load the response into the parent browsing context of the current one. If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as `_self`.
    - `_top`: Load the response into the top-level browsing context (that is, the browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one, and has no parent). If there is no parent, this option behaves the same as `_self`.

### Using the x and y data points

When you submit a form using a button created with `<input type="image">`, two extra data points are submitted to the server automatically by the browser — `x` and `y`. You can see this in action in our [X Y coordinates example](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/forms/image-type-example/xy-coordinates-example.html).

When you click on the image to submit the form, you'll see the data appended to the URL as parameters, for example `?x=52&y=55`. If the image input has a [`name`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#name) attribute, then keep in mind that the specified name is prefixed on every attribute, so if the `name` is `position`, then the returned coordinates would be formatted in the URL as `?position.x=52&position.y=55`. This, of course, applies to all other attributes as well.

These are the X and Y coordinates of the image that the mouse clicked on to submit the form, where (0,0) is the top-left of the image and the default in case submission happens without a click on the image. These can be used when the position the image was clicked on is significant, for example you might have a map that when clicked, sends the coordinates that were clicked to the server. The server-side code then works out what location was clicked on, and returns information about places nearby.

In our above example, we could write server-side code that works out what color was clicked on by the coordinates submitted, and keeps a tally of the favorite colors people voted for.

### Adjusting the image's position and scaling algorithm

You can use the {{cssxref("object-position")}} property to adjust the positioning of the image within the `<input>` element's frame, and the {{cssxref("object-fit")}} property to control how the image's size is adjusted to fit within the frame. This allows you to specify a frame for the image using the `width` and `height` attributes to set aside space in the layout, then adjust where within that space the image is located and how (or if) it is scaled to occupy that space.

## Examples

### A login form

The following example shows the same button as before, but included in the context of a typical login form.

{{ EmbedLiveSample('A_login_form', 600, 170) }}

#### HTML

```html
<form>
  <p>Login to your account</p>
  <div>
    <label for="userId">User ID</label>
    <input type="text" id="userId" name="userId" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="pwd">Password</label>
    <input type="password" id="pwd" name="pwd" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <input
      id="image"
      type="image"
      src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/learning-area/master/html/forms/image-type-example/login.png"
      alt="Login"
      width="100" />
  </div>
</form>
```

#### CSS

And now some CSS to make the basic elements sit more neatly:

```css
div {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

label {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 70px;
  text-align: right;
  padding-right: 10px;
}
```

### Adjusting the image position and scaling

In this example, we adapt the previous example to set aside more space for the image and then adjust the actual image's size and positioning using {{cssxref("object-fit")}} and {{cssxref("object-position")}}.

  padding-right: 10px;
}

#image {
  object-position: right top;
  object-fit: contain;
  background-color: #dddddd;
}
```

Here, `object-position` is configured to draw the image in the top-right corner of the element, while `object-fit` is set to `contain`, which indicates that the image should be drawn at the largest size that will fit within the element's box without altering its aspect ratio. Note the visible grey background of the element still visible in the area not covered by the image.

# <input>: The HTML Input element

The **`<input>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user; a wide variety of types of input data and control widgets are available, depending on the device and {{Glossary("user agent")}}. The `<input>` element is one of the most powerful and complex in all of HTML due to the sheer number of combinations of input types and attributes.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot;&gt;", "tabbed-shorter")}}

```html interactive-example
<label for="name">Name (4 to 8 characters):</label>

<input
  type="text"
  id="name"
  name="name"
  required
  minlength="4"
  maxlength="8"
  size="10" />
```

```css interactive-example
label {
  display: block;
  font:
    1rem "Fira Sans",
    sans-serif;
}

input,
label {
  margin: 0.4rem 0;
}
```

## \<input> types

How an `<input>` works varies considerably depending on the value of its [`type`](#type) attribute, hence the different types are covered in their own separate reference pages. If this attribute is not specified, the default type adopted is `text`.

The available types are as follows:

## Attributes

The `<input>` element is so powerful because of its attributes; the [`type`](#type) attribute, described with examples above, being the most important. Since every `<input>` element, regardless of type, is based on the {{domxref("HTMLInputElement")}} interface, they technically share the exact same set of attributes. However, in reality, most attributes have an effect on only a specific subset of input types. In addition, the way some attributes impact an input depends on the input type, impacting different input types in different ways.

This section provides a table listing all the attributes with a brief description. This table is followed by a list describing each attribute in greater detail, along with which input types they are associated with. Those that are common to most or all input types are defined in greater detail below. Attributes that are unique to particular input types—or attributes which are common to all input types but have special behaviors when used on a given input type—are instead documented on those types' pages.

Attributes for the `<input>` element include the [global HTML attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes) and additionally:

| Attribute                                     | Type(s)                                                                 | Description                                                                                           |

A few additional non-standard attributes are listed following the descriptions of the standard attributes.

### Individual attributes

- [`accept`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/accept)
  - : Valid for the `file` input type only, the `accept` attribute defines which file types are selectable in a `file` upload control. See the {{HTMLElement("input/file", "file")}} input type.

- `alpha` {{experimental_inline}}
  - : Valid for the `color` input type only, the `alpha` attribute provides the end user with the ability to set the opacity of the color being selected.

- `alt`
  - : Valid for the `image` button only, the `alt` attribute provides alternative text for the image, displaying the value of the attribute if the image [`src`](#src) is missing or otherwise fails to load. See the {{HTMLElement("input/image", "image")}} input type.

- `autocapitalize`
  - : Controls whether inputted text is automatically capitalized and, if so, in what manner. See the [`autocapitalize`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/autocapitalize) global attribute page for more information.

- [`autocomplete`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/autocomplete)
  - : (**Not** a Boolean attribute!) The [`autocomplete`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/autocomplete) attribute takes as its value a space-separated string that describes what, if any, type of autocomplete functionality the input should provide. A typical implementation of autocomplete recalls previous values entered in the same input field, but more complex forms of autocomplete can exist. For instance, a browser could integrate with a device's contacts list to autocomplete `email` addresses in an email input field. See [`autocomplete`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/autocomplete#value) for permitted values.

    The `autocomplete` attribute is valid on `hidden`, `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`, `email`, `date`, `month`, `week`, `time`, `datetime-local`, `number`, `range`, `color`, and `password`. This attribute has no effect on input types that do not return numeric or text data, being valid for all input types except `checkbox`, `radio`, `file`, or any of the button types.

    See the [`autocomplete` attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/autocomplete) for additional information, including information on password security and how `autocomplete` is slightly different for `hidden` than for other input types.

- `autofocus`
  - : A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the input should automatically have focus when the page has finished loading (or when the {{HTMLElement("dialog")}} containing the element has been displayed).

    > [!NOTE]
    > An element with the `autofocus` attribute may gain focus before the {{domxref("Document/DOMContentLoaded_event", "DOMContentLoaded")}} event is fired.

    No more than one element in the document may have the `autofocus` attribute. If put on more than one element, the first one with the attribute receives focus.

    The `autofocus` attribute cannot be used on inputs of type `hidden`, since hidden inputs cannot be focused.

    > [!WARNING]
    > Automatically focusing a form control can confuse visually-impaired people using screen-reading technology and people with cognitive impairments. When `autofocus` is assigned, screen-readers "teleport" their user to the form control without warning them beforehand.

    Use careful consideration for accessibility when applying the `autofocus` attribute. Automatically focusing on a control can cause the page to scroll on load. The focus can also cause dynamic keyboards to display on some touch devices. While a screen reader will announce the label of the form control receiving focus, the screen reader will not announce anything before the label, and the sighted user on a small device will equally miss the context created by the preceding content.

- [`capture`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/capture)
  - : Introduced in the HTML Media Capture specification and valid for the `file` input type only, the `capture` attribute defines which media—microphone, video, or camera—should be used to capture a new file for upload with `file` upload control in supporting scenarios. See the {{HTMLElement("input/file", "file")}} input type.
- `checked`
  - : Valid for both `radio` and `checkbox` types, `checked` is a Boolean attribute. If present on a `radio` type, it indicates that the radio button is the currently selected one in the group of same-named radio buttons. If present on a `checkbox` type, it indicates that the checkbox is checked by default (when the page loads). It does _not_ indicate whether this checkbox is currently checked: if the checkbox's state is changed, this content attribute does not reflect the change. (Only the [`HTMLInputElement`'s `checked` IDL attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement) is updated.)

    > [!NOTE]
    > Unlike other input controls, a checkboxes and radio buttons value are only included in the submitted data if they are currently `checked`. If they are, the name and the value(s) of the checked controls are submitted.
    >
    > For example, if a checkbox whose `name` is `fruit` has a `value` of `cherry`, and the checkbox is checked, the form data submitted will include `fruit=cherry`. If the checkbox isn't active, it isn't listed in the form data at all. The default `value` for checkboxes and radio buttons is `on`.

- `colorspace` {{experimental_inline}}
  - : Valid for the `color` input type only, the `colorspace` attribute specifies the [color space](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Color_space) that is used by the `type="color"` input. Possible {{Glossary("enumerated")}} values are:
    - `"limited-srgb"`: The color is in the {{glossary("RGB", "sRGB")}} color space. This includes [`rgb()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/rgb), [`hsl()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl), [`hwb()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hwb), and {{cssxref("hex-color")}} values. The color value is limited to 8-bits per `r`, `g`, and `b` component. This is the default.
    - `"display-p3"`: The [Display P3 color space](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Color_space#display-p3), e.g., `color(display-p3 1.84 -0.19 0.72 / 0.6)`

- [`dirname`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/dirname)
  - : Valid for `hidden`, `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`, and `email` input types, the `dirname` attribute enables the submission of the directionality of the element. When included, the form control will submit with two name/value pairs: the first being the [`name`](#name) and [`value`](#value), and the second being the value of the `dirname` attribute as the name, with a value of `ltr` or `rtl` as set by the browser.

    ```html
    <form action="page.html" method="post">
      <label>
        Fruit:
        <input type="text" name="fruit" dirname="fruit-dir" value="cherry" />
      </label>
      <input type="submit" />
    </form>
    <!-- page.html?fruit=cherry&fruit-dir=ltr -->
    ```

    When the form above is submitted, the input cause both the `name` / `value` pair of `fruit=cherry` and the `dirname` / direction pair of `fruit-dir=ltr` to be sent.
    For more information, see the [`dirname` attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/dirname).

- [`disabled`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/disabled)
  - : A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to interact with the input. Disabled inputs are typically rendered with a dimmer color or using some other form of indication that the field is not available for use.

    Specifically, disabled inputs do not receive the {{domxref("Element/click_event", "click")}} event, and disabled inputs are not submitted with the form.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Although not required by the specification, Firefox will by default [persist the dynamic disabled state](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5985839/bug-with-firefox-disabled-attribute-of-input-not-resetting-when-refreshing) of an `<input>` across page loads. Use the [`autocomplete`](#autocomplete) attribute to control this feature.

- [`form`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/form)
  - : A string specifying the {{HTMLElement("form")}} element with which the input is associated (that is, its **form owner**). This string's value, if present, must match the [`id`](#id) of a `<form>` element in the same document. If this attribute isn't specified, the `<input>` element is associated with the nearest containing form, if any.

    The `form` attribute lets you place an input anywhere in the document but have it included with a form elsewhere in the document.

    > [!NOTE]
    > An input can only be associated with one form.

- `formaction`
  - : Valid for the `image` and `submit` input types only. See the {{HTMLElement("input/submit", "submit")}} input type for more information.
- `formenctype`
  - : Valid for the `image` and `submit` input types only. See the {{HTMLElement("input/submit", "submit")}} input type for more information.
- `formmethod`
  - : Valid for the `image` and `submit` input types only. See the {{HTMLElement("input/submit", "submit")}} input type for more information.
- `formnovalidate`
  - : Valid for the `image` and `submit` input types only. See the {{HTMLElement("input/submit", "submit")}} input type for more information.
- `formtarget`
  - : Valid for the `image` and `submit` input types only. See the {{HTMLElement("input/submit", "submit")}} input type for more information.
- `height`
  - : Valid for the `image` input button only, the `height` is the height of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the {{HTMLElement("input/image", "image")}} input type.
- `id`
  - : Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, it defines a unique identifier (ID) which must be unique in the whole document. Its purpose is to identify the element when linking. The value is used as the value of the {{htmlelement('label')}}'s `for` attribute to link the label with the form control. See {{htmlelement('label')}}.
- `inputmode`
  - : Global value valid for all elements, it provides a hint to browsers as to the type of virtual keyboard configuration to use when editing this element or its contents. Values include `none`, `text`, `tel`, `url`, `email`, `numeric`, `decimal`, and `search`.
- `list`
  - : The value given to the `list` attribute should be the {{domxref("Element.id", "id")}} of a {{HTMLElement("datalist")}} element located in the same document. The `<datalist>` provides a list of predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in the list that are not compatible with the [`type`](#type) are not included in the suggested options. The values provided are suggestions, not requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a different value.

    It is valid on `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`, `email`, `date`, `month`, `week`, `time`, `datetime-local`, `number`, `range`, and `color`.

    Per the specifications, the `list` attribute is not supported by the `hidden`, `password`, `checkbox`, `radio`, `file`, or any of the button types.

    Depending on the browser, the user may see a custom color palette suggested, tic marks along a range, or even an input that opens like a {{HTMLElement("select")}} but allows for non-listed values. Check out the [browser compatibility table](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/datalist#browser_compatibility) for the other input types.

    See the {{htmlelement('datalist')}} element.

- [`max`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/max)
  - : Valid for `date`, `month`, `week`, `time`, `datetime-local`, `number`, and `range`, it defines the greatest value in the range of permitted values. If the [`value`](#value) entered into the element exceeds this, the element fails [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation). If the value of the `max` attribute isn't a number, then the element has no maximum value.

    There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of `max` may be lower than the value of `min`, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM.

- [`maxlength`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/maxlength)
  - : Valid for `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`, `email`, and `password`, it defines the maximum string length (measured in {{glossary("UTF-16", "UTF-16 code units")}}) that the user can enter into the field. This must be an integer value of 0 or higher. If no `maxlength` is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the field has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of `minlength`.

    The input will fail [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation) if the length of the text entered into the field is greater than `maxlength` {{glossary("UTF-16", "UTF-16 code units")}} long. By default, browsers prevent users from entering more characters than allowed by the `maxlength` attribute. Constraint validation is only applied when the value is changed by the user. See [Client-side validation](#client-side_validation) for more information.

- [`min`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/min)
  - : Valid for `date`, `month`, `week`, `time`, `datetime-local`, `number`, and `range`, it defines the most negative value in the range of permitted values. If the [`value`](#value) entered into the element is less than this, the element fails [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation). If the value of the `min` attribute isn't a number, then the element has no minimum value.

    This value must be less than or equal to the value of the `max` attribute. If the `min` attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no `min` value is applied. If the `min` attribute is valid and a non-empty value is less than the minimum allowed by the `min` attribute, constraint validation will prevent form submission. See [Client-side validation](#client-side_validation) for more information.

    There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of `max` may be lower than the value of `min`, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM.

- [`minlength`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/minlength)
  - : Valid for `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`, `email`, and `password`, it defines the minimum string length (measured in {{glossary("UTF-16", "UTF-16 code units")}}) that the user can enter into the entry field. This must be a non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by `maxlength`. If no `minlength` is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the input has no minimum length.

    The input will fail [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation) if the length of the text entered into the field is fewer than `minlength` {{glossary("UTF-16", "UTF-16 code units")}} long, preventing form submission. Constraint validation is only applied when the value is changed by the user. See [Client-side validation](#client-side_validation) for more information.

- [`multiple`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/multiple)
  - : The Boolean `multiple` attribute, if set, means the user can enter comma separated email addresses in the email widget or can choose more than one file with the `file` input. See the {{HTMLElement("input/email", "email")}} and {{HTMLElement("input/file", "file")}} input type.

- `name`
  - : A string specifying a name for the input control. This name is submitted along with the control's value when the form data is submitted.

    Consider the `name` a required attribute (even though it's not). If an input has no `name` specified, or `name` is empty, the input's value is not submitted with the form! (Disabled controls, unchecked radio buttons, unchecked checkboxes, and reset buttons are also not sent.)

    There are two special cases:
    1. `_charset_` : If used as the name of an `<input>` element of type {{HTMLElement("input/hidden", "hidden")}}, the input's `value` is automatically set by the {{Glossary("user agent")}} to the character encoding being used to submit the form.
    2. `isindex`: For historical reasons, the name [`isindex`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#attr-fe-name) is not allowed.

    The [`name`](#name) attribute creates a unique behavior for radio buttons.

    Only one radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons can be checked at a time. Selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group. The value of that one checked radio button is sent along with the name if the form is submitted,

    When tabbing into a series of same-named group of radio buttons, if one is checked, that one will receive focus. If they aren't grouped together in source order, if one of the group is checked, tabbing into the group starts when the first one in the group is encountered, skipping all those that aren't checked. In other words, if one is checked, tabbing skips the unchecked radio buttons in the group. If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus when the first button in the same name group is reached.

    Once one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow keys will navigate through all the radio buttons of the same name, even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in the source order.

    When an input element is given a `name`, that name becomes a property of the owning form element's {{domxref("HTMLFormElement.elements")}} property. If you have an input whose `name` is set to `guest` and another whose `name` is `hat-size`, the following code can be used:

    ```js
    let form = document.querySelector("form");

    let guestName = form.elements.guest;
    let hatSize = form.elements["hat-size"];
    ```

    When this code has run, `guestName` will be the {{domxref("HTMLInputElement")}} for the `guest` field, and `hatSize` the object for the `hat-size` field.

    > [!WARNING]
    > Avoid giving form elements a `name` that corresponds to a built-in property of the form, since you would then override the predefined property or method with this reference to the corresponding input.

- [`pattern`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/pattern)
  - : Valid for `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`, `email`, and `password`, the `pattern` attribute is used to compile a regular expression that the input's [`value`](#value) must match in order for the value to pass [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation). It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the {{jsxref("RegExp")}} type, and as documented in our [guide on regular expressions](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions). No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text. When compiling the regular expression:
    1. the pattern will be implicitly wrapped with `^(?:` and `)$`, such that the match is required against the _entire_ input value, i.e., `^(?:<pattern>)$`.
    2. the `'v'` flag is specified so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as {{Glossary("ASCII")}}.

    If the `pattern` attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely. If the pattern attribute is valid and a non-empty value does not match the pattern, constraint validation will prevent form submission. If the [`multiple`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/multiple) is present, the compiled regular expression is matched against each comma separated value.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If using the `pattern` attribute, inform the user about the expected format by including explanatory text nearby. You can also include a [`title`](#title) attribute to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern; most browsers will display this title as a tooltip. The visible explanation is required for accessibility. The tooltip is an enhancement.

    See [Client-side validation](#client-side_validation) for more information.

- [`placeholder`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/placeholder)
  - : Valid for `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`, `email`, `password`, and `number`, the `placeholder` attribute provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that provides a hint as to the expected type of data, rather than an explanation or prompt. The text _must not_ include carriage returns or line feeds. So for example if a field is expected to capture a user's first name, and its label is "First Name", a suitable placeholder might be "e.g., Mustafa".

    > [!NOTE]
    > The `placeholder` attribute is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See [Labels](#labels) for more information.

- `popovertarget`
  - : Turns an `<input type="button">` element into a popover control button; takes the ID of the popover element to control as its value. See the {{domxref("Popover API", "Popover API", "", "nocode")}} landing page for more details. Establishing a relationship between a popover and its invoker button using the `popovertarget` attribute has two additional useful effects:
    - The browser creates an implicit [`aria-details`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-details) and [`aria-expanded`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-expanded) relationship between popover and invoker, and places the popover in a logical position in the keyboard focus navigation order when shown. This makes the popover more accessible to keyboard and assistive technology (AT) users (see also [Popover accessibility features](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API/Using#popover_accessibility_features)).
    - The browser creates an implicit anchor reference between the two, making it very convenient to position popovers relative to their controls using [CSS anchor positioning](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning). See [Popover anchor positioning](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API/Using#popover_anchor_positioning) for more details.

- `popovertargetaction`
  - : Specifies the action to be performed on a popover element being controlled by a control `<input type="button">`. Possible values are:
    - `"hide"`
      - : The button will hide a shown popover. If you try to hide an already hidden popover, no action will be taken.
    - `"show"`
      - : The button will show a hidden popover. If you try to show an already showing popover, no action will be taken.
    - `"toggle"`
      - : The button will toggle a popover between showing and hidden. If the popover is hidden, it will be shown; if the popover is showing, it will be hidden. If `popovertargetaction` is omitted, `"toggle"` is the default action that will be performed by the control button.

- [`readonly`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/readonly)
  - : A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to edit the value of the input. The `readonly` attribute is supported by the `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`, `email`, `date`, `month`, `week`, `time`, `datetime-local`, `number`, and `password` input types.

    See the [HTML attribute: `readonly`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/readonly) for more information.

- [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/required)
  - : `required` is a Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value for the input before the owning form can be submitted. The `required` attribute is supported by `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`, `email`, `date`, `month`, `week`, `time`, `datetime-local`, `number`, `password`, `checkbox`, `radio`, and `file` inputs.

    See [Client-side validation](#client-side_validation) and the [HTML attribute: `required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/required) for more information.

- [`size`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/size)
  - : Valid for `email`, `password`, `tel`, `url`, and `text`, the `size` attribute specifies how much of the input is shown. Basically creates same result as setting CSS [`width`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width) property with a few specialties. The actual unit of the value depends on the input type. For `password` and `text`, it is a number of characters (or `em` units) with a default value of `20`, and for others, it is pixels (or `px` units). CSS `width` takes precedence over the `size` attribute.

- `src`
  - : Valid for the `image` input button only, the `src` is string specifying the URL of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the {{HTMLElement("input/image", "image")}} input type.

- [`step`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/step)
  - : Valid for `date`, `month`, `week`, `time`, `datetime-local`, `number`, and `range`, the [`step`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/step) attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to. Only values which are a whole number of steps from the step base are valid. The step base is [`min`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/min) if specified, [`value`](#value) otherwise, or `0` if neither is provided (except for `week`, which has a default step base of −259,200,000, representing the start of week `1970-W01`).

    If not explicitly included:
    - `step` defaults to 1 for `number` and `range`.
    - Each date/time input type has a default `step` value appropriate for the type; see the individual input pages: [`date`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/date#step), [`datetime-local`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/datetime-local#step), [`month`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/month#step), [`time`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/time#step), and [`week`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/week#step).

    The value must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special value `any`, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as [`min`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/min) and [`max`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/max)).

    For example, if you have `<input type="number" min="10" step="2">`, then any even integer, `10` or greater, is valid. If omitted, `<input type="number">`, any integer is valid, but floats (like `4.2`) are not valid, because `step` defaults to `1`. For `4.2` to be valid, `step` would have had to be set to `any`, 0.1, 0.2, or the `min` value would have had to be a number ending in `.2`, such as `<input type="number" min="-5.2">`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in constraint validation and will match the `:invalid` pseudoclass.

    See [Client-side validation](#client-side_validation) for more information.

- `tabindex`
  - : Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, an integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation. As all input types except for input of type hidden are focusable, this attribute should not be used on form controls, because doing so would require the management of the focus order for all elements within the document with the risk of harming usability and accessibility if done incorrectly.

- `title`
  - : Global attribute valid for all elements, including all input types, containing a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to. Such information can typically, but not necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip. The title should NOT be used as the primary explanation of the purpose of the form control. Instead, use the {{htmlelement('label')}} element with a `for` attribute set to the form control's [`id`](#id) attribute. See [Labels](#labels) below.

- `type`
  - : A string specifying the type of control to render. For example, to create a checkbox, a value of `checkbox` is used. If omitted (or an unknown value is specified), the input type `text` is used, creating a plaintext input field.

    Permitted values are listed in [Input types](#input_types) above.

- `value`
  - : The input control's value. When specified in the HTML, this is the initial value, and from then on it can be altered or retrieved at any time using JavaScript to access the respective {{domxref("HTMLInputElement")}} object's `value` property. The `value` attribute is always optional, though should be considered mandatory for `checkbox`, `radio`, and `hidden`.

- `width`
  - : Valid for the `image` input button only, the `width` is the width of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the {{HTMLElement("input/image", "image")}} input type.

### Non-standard attributes

The following non-standard attributes are also available on some browsers. As a general rule, you should avoid using them unless it can't be helped.

<table class="no-markdown">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Attribute</th>
      <th scope="col">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="#incremental"><code>incremental</code></a></td>
      <td>
        Whether or not to send repeated {{domxref("HTMLInputElement/search_event", "search")}} events to allow updating live search results while the user is still editing the value of the field.
        <strong>WebKit and Blink only (Safari, Chrome, Opera, etc.).</strong>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>mozactionhint</code> {{deprecated_inline}}</td>
      <td>
        <p>A string indicating the type of action that will be taken when the user
        presses the <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Return</kbd> key while editing the
        field; this is used to determine an appropriate label for that key on a
        virtual keyboard. <strong>Since this attribute is deprecated, use <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/enterkeyhint"><code>enterkeyhint</code></a> instead.</strong></p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="#orient"><code>orient</code></a></td>
      <td>
        Sets the orientation of the range slider. <strong>Firefox only</strong>.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="#results"><code>results</code></a></td>
      <td>
        The maximum number of items that should be displayed in the drop-down list of previous search queries. <strong>Safari only.</strong>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <a href="#webkitdirectory"><code>webkitdirectory</code></a>
      </td>
      <td>
        A Boolean indicating whether to only allow the user to choose a directory (or directories, if <a href="#multiple"><code>multiple</code></a> is also present)
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

- `incremental` {{non-standard_inline}}
  - : The Boolean attribute `incremental` is a WebKit and Blink extension (so supported by Safari, Opera, Chrome, etc.) which, if present, tells the {{Glossary("user agent")}} to process the input as a live search. As the user edits the value of the field, the user agent sends {{domxref("HTMLInputElement/search_event", "search")}} events to the {{domxref("HTMLInputElement")}} object representing the search box. This allows your code to update the search results in real time as the user edits the search.

    If `incremental` is not specified, the {{domxref("HTMLInputElement/search_event", "search")}} event is only sent when the user explicitly initiates a search (such as by pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Return</kbd> key while editing the field).

    The `search` event is rate-limited so that it is not sent more frequently than an implementation-defined interval.

- `orient` {{non-standard_inline}}
  - : Similar to the -moz-orient non-standard CSS property impacting the {{htmlelement('progress')}} and {{htmlelement('meter')}} elements, the `orient` attribute defines the orientation of the range slider. Values include `horizontal`, meaning the range is rendered horizontally, and `vertical`, where the range is rendered vertically. See [Creating vertical form controls](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_writing_modes/Vertical_controls) for a modern approach to creating vertical form controls.

- `results` {{non-standard_inline}}
  - : The `results` attribute—supported only by Safari—is a numeric value that lets you override the maximum number of entries to be displayed in the `<input>` element's natively-provided drop-down menu of previous search queries.

    The value must be a non-negative decimal number. If not provided, or an invalid value is given, the browser's default maximum number of entries is used.

- `webkitdirectory` {{non-standard_inline}}
  - : The Boolean `webkitdirectory` attribute, if present, indicates that only directories should be available to be selected by the user in the file picker interface. See {{domxref("HTMLInputElement.webkitdirectory")}} for additional details and examples.

    Though originally implemented only for WebKit-based browsers, `webkitdirectory` is also usable in Microsoft Edge as well as Firefox 50 and later. However, even though it has relatively broad support, it is still not standard and should not be used unless you have no alternative.

## Methods

The following methods are provided by the {{domxref("HTMLInputElement")}} interface which represents `<input>` elements in the DOM. Also available are those methods specified by the parent interfaces, {{domxref("HTMLElement")}}, {{domxref("Element")}}, {{domxref("Node")}}, and {{domxref("EventTarget")}}.

- {{domxref("HTMLInputElement.checkValidity", "checkValidity()")}}
  - : Returns `true` if the element's value passes validity checks; otherwise, returns `false` and fires an {{domxref("HTMLInputElement.invalid_event", "invalid")}} event at the element.
- {{domxref("HTMLInputElement.reportValidity", "reportValidity()")}}
  - : Returns `true` if the element's value passes validity checks; otherwise, returns `false`, fires an {{domxref("HTMLInputElement.invalid_event", "invalid")}} event at the element, and (if the event isn't canceled) reports the problem to the user.
- {{domxref("HTMLInputElement.select", "select()")}}
  - : Selects the entire content of the `<input>` element, if the element's content is selectable. For elements with no selectable text content (such as a visual color picker or calendar date input), this method does nothing.
- {{domxref("HTMLInputElement.setCustomValidity", "setCustomValidity()")}}
  - : Sets a custom message to display if the input element's value isn't valid.
- {{domxref("HTMLInputElement.setRangeText", "setRangeText()")}}
  - : Sets the contents of the specified range of characters in the input element to a given string. A `selectMode` parameter is available to allow controlling how the existing content is affected.
- {{domxref("HTMLInputElement.setSelectionRange", "setSelectionRange()")}}
  - : Selects the specified range of characters within a textual input element. Does nothing for inputs which aren't presented as text input fields.
- {{domxref("HTMLInputElement.showPicker", "showPicker()")}}
  - : Displays the browser picker for the input element that would normally be displayed when the element is selected, but triggered from a button press or other user interaction.
- {{domxref("HTMLInputElement.stepDown", "stepDown()")}}
  - : Decrements the value of a numeric input by one, by default, or by the specified number of units.
- {{domxref("HTMLInputElement.stepUp", "stepUp()")}}
  - : Increments the value of a numeric input by one or by the specified number of units.

## CSS

Inputs, being replaced elements, have a few features not applicable to non form elements. There are CSS selectors that can specifically target form controls based on their UI features, also known as UI pseudo-classes. The input element can also be targeted by type with attribute selectors. There are some properties that are especially useful as well.

### UI pseudo-classes

#### Pseudo-classes example

We can style a checkbox label based on whether the checkbox is checked or not. In this example, we are styling the {{cssxref('color')}} and {{cssxref('font-weight')}} of the {{htmlelement('label')}} that comes immediately after a checked input. We haven't applied any styles if the `input` is not checked.

```html hidden
<input id="checkboxInput" type="checkbox" />
<label for="checkboxInput">Toggle the checkbox on and off</label>
```

```css
input:checked + label {
  color: red;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Pseudo-classes_example', 500, 80)}}

### Attribute selectors

It is possible to target different types of form controls based on their [`type`](#type) using [attribute selectors](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Attribute_selectors). CSS attribute selectors match elements based on either just the presence of an attribute or the value of a given attribute.

```css
/* matches a password input */
input[type="password"] {
}

/* matches a form control whose valid values are limited to a range of values */
input[min][max] {
}

/* matches a form control with a pattern attribute */
input[pattern] {
}
```

### ::placeholder

By default, the appearance of placeholder text is a translucent or light gray. The {{cssxref('::placeholder')}} pseudo-element is the input's [`placeholder` text](#placeholder). It can be styled with a limited subset of CSS properties.

```css
::placeholder {
  color: blue;
}
```

Only the subset of CSS properties that apply to the {{cssxref("::first-line")}} pseudo-element can be used in a rule using `::placeholder` in its selector.

### caret-color

A property specific to text entry-related elements is the CSS {{cssxref("caret-color")}} property, which lets you set the color used to draw the text input caret:

#### HTML

```html
<label for="textInput">Note the red caret:</label>
<input id="textInput" class="custom" size="32" />
```

#### CSS

```css
input.custom {
  caret-color: red;
  font:
    16px "Helvetica",
    "Arial",
    sans-serif;
}
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample('caret-color', 500, 80)}}

### field-sizing

The {{cssxref("field-sizing")}} property enables you to control the sizing behavior of form inputs (i.e., they are given a default preferred size by default.) This property enables you to override the default behavior, allowing form controls to adjust in size to fit their contents.

This property is typically used to create form fields that shrinkwrap their content and grow as more text is entered. This works with input types that accept direct text input (for example, [`text`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/text) and [`url`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/url)), input type [`file`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/file), and {{htmlelement("textarea")}} elements.

### object-position and object-fit

In certain cases (typically involving non-textual inputs and specialized interfaces), the `<input>` element is a {{ glossary("replaced elements", "replaced element")}}. When it is, the position and size of the element's size and positioning within its frame can be adjusted using the CSS {{cssxref("object-position")}} and {{cssxref("object-fit")}} properties.

## Additional features

### Labels

Labels are needed to associate assistive text with an `<input>`. The {{HTMLElement("label")}} element provides explanatory information about a form field that is _always_ appropriate (aside from any layout concerns you have). It's never a bad idea to use a `<label>` to explain what should be entered into an `<input>` or {{HTMLElement("textarea")}}.

#### Associated labels

The semantic pairing of `<input>` and `<label>` elements is useful for assistive technologies such as screen readers. By pairing them using the `<label>`'s [`for`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/label#for) attribute, you bond the label to the input in a way that lets screen readers describe inputs to users more precisely.

It does not suffice to have plain text adjacent to the `<input>` element. Rather, usability and accessibility requires the inclusion of either implicit or explicit {{HTMLElement("label")}}:

```html
<!-- inaccessible -->
<p>Enter your name: <input id="name" type="text" size="30" /></p>

<!-- implicit label -->
<p>
  <label>Enter your name: <input id="name" type="text" size="30" /></label>
</p>

<!-- explicit label -->
<p>
  <label for="name">Enter your name: </label>
  <input id="name" type="text" size="30" />
</p>
```

The first example is inaccessible: no relationship exists between the prompt and the `<input>` element.

In addition to an accessible name, the label provides a larger 'hit' area for mouse and touch screen users to click on or touch. By pairing a `<label>` with an `<input>`, clicking on either one will focus the `<input>`. If you use plain text to "label" your input, this won't happen. Having the prompt part of the activation area for the input is helpful for people with motor control conditions.

As web developers, it's important that we never assume that people will know all the things that we know. The diversity of people using the web—and by extension your website—practically guarantees that some of your site's visitors will have some variation in thought processes and/or circumstances that leads them to interpret your forms very differently from you without clear and properly-presented labels.

#### Placeholders are not accessible

The [`placeholder`](#placeholder) attribute lets you specify text that appears within the `<input>` element's content area itself when it is empty. The placeholder should never be required to understand your forms. It is not a label, and should not be used as a substitute, because it isn't. The placeholder is used to provide a hint as to what an inputted value should look like, not an explanation or prompt.

Not only is the placeholder not accessible to screen readers, but once the user enters any text into the form control, or if the form control already has a value, the placeholder disappears. Browsers with automatic page translation features may skip over attributes when translating, meaning the `placeholder` may not get translated.

> [!NOTE]
> Don't use the [`placeholder`](#placeholder) attribute if you can avoid it. If you need to label an `<input>` element, use the {{HTMLElement("label")}} element.

### Client-side validation

> [!WARNING]
> Client-side validation is useful, but it does _not_ guarantee that the server will receive valid data. If the data must be in a specific format, _always_ verify it also on the server-side, and return a [`400` HTTP response](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/400) if the format is invalid.

In addition to using CSS to style inputs based on the {{cssxref(":valid")}} or {{cssxref(":invalid")}} UI states based on the current state of each input, as noted in the [UI pseudo-classes](#ui_pseudo-classes) section above, the browser provides for client-side validation on (attempted) form submission. On form submission, if there is a form control that fails constraint validation, supporting browsers will display an error message on the first invalid form control; displaying a default message based on the error type, or a message set by you.

Some input types and other attributes place limits on what values are valid for a given input. For example, `<input type="number" min="2" max="10" step="2">` means only the number 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 are valid. Several errors could occur, including a `rangeUnderflow` error if the value is less than 2, `rangeOverflow` if greater than 10, `stepMismatch` if the value is a number between 2 and 10, but not an even integer (does not match the requirements of the `step` attribute), or `typeMismatch` if the value is not a number.

For the input types whose domain of possible values is periodic (that is, at the highest possible value, the values wrap back around to the beginning rather than ending), it's possible for the values of the [`max`](#max) and [`min`](#min) properties to be reversed, which indicates that the range of permitted values starts at `min`, wraps around to the lowest possible value, then continues on until `max` is reached. This is particularly useful for dates and times, such as when you want to allow the range to be from 8 PM to 8 AM:

```html
<input type="time" min="20:00" max="08:00" name="overnight" />
```

Specific attributes and their values can lead to a specific error {{domxref('ValidityState')}}:

      <td>{{domxref('validityState.typeMismatch')}}</td>
      <td>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

If a form control doesn't have the `required` attribute, no value, or an empty string, is not invalid. Even if the above attributes are present, with the exception of `required`, an empty string will not lead to an error.

We can set limits on what values we accept, and supporting browsers will natively validate these form values and alert the user if there is a mistake when the form is submitted.

In addition to the errors described in the table above, the `validityState` interface contains the `badInput`, `valid`, and `customError` boolean readonly properties. The validity object includes:

- {{domxref('validityState.valueMissing')}}
- {{domxref('validityState.typeMismatch')}}
- {{domxref('validityState.patternMismatch')}}
- {{domxref('validityState.tooLong')}}
- {{domxref('validityState.tooShort')}}
- {{domxref('validityState.rangeUnderflow')}}
- {{domxref('validityState.rangeOverflow')}}
- {{domxref('validityState.stepMismatch')}}
- {{domxref('validityState.badInput')}}
- {{domxref('validityState', 'validityState.valid')}}
- {{domxref('validityState', 'validityState.customError')}}

For each of these Boolean properties, a value of `true` indicates that the specified reason validation may have failed is true, with the exception of the `valid` property, which is `true` if the element's value obeys all constraints.

If there is an error, supporting browsers will both alert the user and prevent the form from being submitted. A word of caution: if a custom error is set to a truthy value (anything other than the empty string or `null`), the form will be prevented from being submitted. If there is no custom error message, and none of the other properties return true, `valid` will be true, and the form can be submitted.

```js
function validate(input) {
  let validityState_object = input.validity;
  if (validityState_object.valueMissing) {
    input.setCustomValidity("A value is required");
  } else if (validityState_object.rangeUnderflow) {
    input.setCustomValidity("Your value is too low");
  } else if (validityState_object.rangeOverflow) {
    input.setCustomValidity("Your value is too high");
  } else {
    input.setCustomValidity("");
  }
}
```

The last line, setting the custom validity message to the empty string is vital. If the user makes an error, and the validity is set, it will fail to submit, even if all the values are valid, until the message is `null`.

#### Custom validation error example

If you want to present a custom error message when a field fails to validate, you need to use the [Constraint Validation API](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Form_validation#validating_forms_using_javascript) available on `<input>` (and related) elements. Take the following form:

```html
<form>
  <label for="name">Enter username (upper and lowercase letters): </label>
  <input type="text" name="name" id="name" required pattern="[A-Za-z]+" />
  <button>Submit</button>
</form>
```

The basic HTML form validation features will cause this to produce a default error message if you try to submit the form with either no valid filled in, or a value that does not match the `pattern`.

If you wanted to instead display custom error messages, you could use JavaScript like the following:

```js
const nameInput = document.querySelector("input");

nameInput.addEventListener("input", () => {
  nameInput.setCustomValidity("");
  nameInput.checkValidity();
});

nameInput.addEventListener("invalid", () => {
  if (nameInput.value === "") {
    nameInput.setCustomValidity("Enter your username!");
  } else {
    nameInput.setCustomValidity(
      "Usernames can only contain upper and lowercase letters. Try again!",
    );
  }
});
```

The example renders like so:

{{EmbedLiveSample('Custom_validation_error_example')}}

In brief:

- We check the valid state of the input element every time its value is changed by running the `checkValidity()` method via the `input` event handler.
- If the value is invalid, an `invalid` event is raised, and the `invalid` event handler function is run. Inside this function we work out whether the value is invalid because it is empty, or because it doesn't match the pattern, using an `if ()` block, and set a custom validity error message.
- As a result, if the input value is invalid when the submit button is pressed, one of the custom error messages will be shown.
- If it is valid, it will submit as you'd expect. For this to happen, the custom validity has to be cancelled, by invoking `setCustomValidity()` with an empty string value. We therefore do this every time the `input` event is raised. If you don't do this, and a custom validity was previously set, the input will register as invalid, even if it currently contains a valid value on submission.

> [!NOTE]
> Always validate input constraints both client side and server side. Constraint validation doesn't remove the need for validation on the _server side_. Invalid values can still be sent by older browsers or by bad actors.

> [!NOTE]
> Firefox supported a proprietary error attribute — `x-moz-errormessage` — for many versions, which allowed you set custom error messages in a similar way. This has been removed as of version 66 (see [Firefox bug 1513890](https://bugzil.la/1513890)).

### Localization

The allowed inputs for certain `<input>` types depend on the locale. In some locales, 1,000.00 is a valid number, while in other locales the valid way to enter this number is 1.000,00.

Firefox uses the following heuristics to determine the locale to validate the user's input (at least for `type="number"`):

- Try the language specified by a `lang`/`xml:lang` attribute on the element or any of its parents.
- Try the language specified by any `Content-Language` HTTP header. Or,
- If none specified, use the browser's locale.

## Accessibility

### Labels

When including inputs, it is an accessibility requirement to add labels alongside. This is needed so those who use assistive technologies can tell what the input is for. Also, clicking or touching a label gives focus to the label's associated form control. This improves the accessibility and usability for sighted users, increases the area a user can click or touch to activate the form control. This is especially useful (and even needed) for radio buttons and checkboxes, which are tiny. For more information about labels in general see [Labels](#labels).

The following is an example of how to associate the `<label>` with an `<input>` element in the above style. You need to give the `<input>` an `id` attribute. The `<label>` then needs a `for` attribute whose value is the same as the input's `id`.

```html
<label for="peas">Do you like peas?</label>
<input type="checkbox" name="peas" id="peas" />
```

### Size

Interactive elements such as form input should provide an area large enough that it is easy to activate them. This helps a variety of people, including people with motor control issues and people using non-precise forms of input such as a stylus or fingers. A minimum interactive size of 44×44 [CSS pixels](https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/#dfn-css-pixels) is recommended.

# <input type="month">

{{HTMLElement("input")}} elements of type **`month`** create input fields that let the user enter a month and year allowing a month and year to be easily entered.
The value is a string whose value is in the format `YYYY-MM`, where `YYYY` is the four-digit year and `MM` is the month number.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;input type=&quot;month&quot;&gt;", "tabbed-shorter")}}

```html interactive-example
<label for="start">Start month:</label>

<input type="month" id="start" name="start" min="2018-03" value="2018-05" />
```

```css interactive-example
label {
  display: block;
  font:
    1rem "Fira Sans",
    sans-serif;
}

input,
label {
  margin: 0.4rem 0;
}
```

The control's UI varies in general from browser to browser; at the moment support is patchy, with only Chrome/Opera and Edge on desktop — and most modern mobile browser versions — having usable implementations.
In browsers that don't support `month` inputs, the control degrades gracefully to [`<input type="text">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/text), although there may be automatic validation of the entered text to ensure it's formatted as expected.

For those of you using a browser that doesn't support `month`, the screenshot below shows what it looks like in Chrome and Opera.
Clicking the down arrow on the right-hand side brings up a date picker that lets you select the month and year.

![Month control on Chrome browser](month-control-chrome.png)

The Microsoft Edge `month` control looks like this:

![Month control on Edge browser](month-control-edge.png)

## Value

A string representing the value of the month and year entered into the input, in the form YYYY-MM (four or more digit year, then a hyphen (`-`), followed by the two-digit month).
The format of the month string used by this input type is described in [Month strings](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Date_and_time_formats#month_strings).

### Setting a default value

You can set a default value for the input control by including a month and year inside the [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) attribute, like so:

```html
<label for="bday-month">What month were you born in?</label>
<input id="bday-month" type="month" name="bday-month" value="2001-06" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Setting_a_default_value', 600, 60)}}

One thing to note is that the displayed date format differs from the actual `value`; most {{Glossary("user agent", "user agents")}} display the month and year in a locale-appropriate form, based on the set locale of the user's operating system, whereas the date `value` is always formatted `yyyy-MM`.

When the above value is submitted to the server, for example, it will look like `bday-month=1978-06`.

### Setting the value using JavaScript

You can also get and set the date value in JavaScript using the {{domxref("HTMLInputElement.value")}} property, for example:

```html
<label for="bday-month">What month were you born in?</label>
<input id="bday-month" type="month" name="bday-month" />
```

```js
const monthControl = document.querySelector('input[type="month"]');
monthControl.value = "2001-06";
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Setting_the_value_using_JavaScript", 600, 60)}}

## Additional attributes

In addition to the attributes common to {{HTMLElement("input")}} elements, month inputs offer the following attributes.

### list

The values of the list attribute is the {{domxref("Element.id", "id")}} of a {{HTMLElement("datalist")}} element located in the same document.
The {{HTMLElement("datalist")}} provides a list of predefined values to suggest to the user for this input.
Any values in the list that are not compatible with the [`type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#type) are not included in the suggested options.
The values provided are suggestions, not requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a different value.

### max

The latest year and month, in the string format discussed in the [Value](#value) section above, to accept.
If the [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) entered into the element exceeds this, the element fails [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation).
If the value of the `max` attribute isn't a valid string in `yyyy-MM` format, then the element has no maximum value.

This value must specify a year-month pairing later than or equal to the one specified by the `min` attribute.

### min

The earliest year and month to accept, in the same `yyyy-MM` format described above.
If the [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) of the element is less than this, the element fails [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation).
If a value is specified for `min` that isn't a valid year and month string, the input has no minimum value.

This value must be a year-month pairing which is earlier than or equal to the one specified by the `max` attribute.

### readonly

A Boolean attribute which, if present, means this field cannot be edited by the user.
Its `value` can, however, still be changed from JavaScript code that directly sets the value of the {{domxref("HTMLInputElement.value")}} property.

> [!NOTE]
> Because a read-only field cannot have a value, `required` does not have any effect on inputs with the `readonly` attribute also specified.

### step

The `step` attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to, or the special value `any`, which is described below. Only values which are a whole number of steps from the step base are valid. The step base is [`min`](#min) if specified, [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) otherwise, or `0` (the Unix epoch, `1970-01`) if neither is provided.

For `month` inputs, the value of `step` is given in months. The default value of `step` is 1, indicating 1 month.

A string value of `any` means that no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as [`min`](#min) and [`max`](#max)). In reality, it has the same effect as `1` for `month` inputs because the picker UI only allows selecting whole months.

> [!NOTE]
> When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping configuration, the {{Glossary("user agent")}} may round to the nearest valid value, preferring numbers in the positive direction when there are two equally close options.

## Using month inputs

Date-related inputs (including `month`) sound convenient at first glance; they promise an easy UI for choosing dates, and they normalize the data format sent to the server, regardless of the user's locale.
However, there are issues with `<input type="month">` because at this time, many major browsers don't yet support it.

We'll look at basic and more complex uses of `<input type="month">`, then offer advice on mitigating the browser support issue in the section [Handling browser support](#handling_browser_support)).

### Basic uses of month

The most basic use of `<input type="month">` involves a basic {{HTMLElement("input")}} and {{htmlelement("label")}} element combination, as seen below:

```html
<form>
  <label for="bday-month">What month were you born in?</label>
  <input id="bday-month" type="month" name="bday-month" />
</form>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Basic_uses_of_month', 600, 40)}}

### Setting maximum and minimum dates

You can use the [`min`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#min) and [`max`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#max) attributes to restrict the range of dates that the user can choose.
In the following example we specify a minimum month of `1900-01` and a maximum month of `2013-12`:

```html
<form>
  <label for="bday-month">What month were you born in?</label>
  <input
    id="bday-month"
    type="month"
    name="bday-month"
    min="1900-01"
    max="2013-12" />
</form>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Setting_maximum_and_minimum_dates', 600, 40)}}

The result here is that:

- Only months between in January 1900 and December 2013 can be selected; months outside that range can't be scrolled to in the control.
- Depending on what browser you are using, you might find that months outside the specified range might not be selectable in the month picker (e.g., Edge), or invalid (see [Validation](#validation)) but still available (e.g., Chrome).

### Controlling input size

`<input type="month">` doesn't support form sizing attributes such as [`size`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#size).
You'll have to resort to [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) for sizing needs.

## Validation

By default, `<input type="month">` does not apply any validation to entered values.
The UI implementations generally don't let you enter anything that isn't a date — which is helpful — but you can still submit the form with the `month` input empty, or enter an invalid date (e.g., the 32nd of April).

To help avoid this, you can use [`min`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#min) and [`max`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#max) to restrict the available dates (see [Setting maximum and minimum dates](#setting_maximum_and_minimum_dates)), and in addition use the [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#required) attribute to make filling in the date mandatory.
As a result, supporting browsers will display an error if you try to submit a date that is outside the set bounds, or an empty date field.

Let's look at an example; here we've set minimum and maximum dates, and also made the field required:

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <label for="month">
      What month would you like to visit (June to Sept.)?
    </label>
    <input
      id="month"
      type="month"
      name="month"
      min="2022-06"
      max="2022-09"
      required />
    <span class="validity"></span>
  </div>
  <div>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit form" />
  </div>
</form>
```

If you try to submit the form without both the month and year specified (or with a date outside the set bounds), the browser displays an error.
Try playing with the example now:

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Validation', 600, 120) }}

Here's a screenshot for those of you who aren't using a supporting browser:

![Month required prompt on Chrome browser](month-required.png)

Here's the CSS used in the above example.
Here we make use of the {{cssxref(":valid")}} and {{cssxref(":invalid")}} CSS properties to style the input based on whether the current value is valid.
We had to put the icons on a {{htmlelement("span")}} next to the input, not on the input itself, because in Chrome the generated content is placed inside the form control, and can't be styled or shown effectively.

```css
div {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  position: relative;
}

input[type="number"] {
  width: 100px;
}

input + span {
  padding-right: 30px;
}

input:invalid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✖";
  padding-left: 5px;
}

input:valid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✓";
  padding-left: 5px;
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> HTML form validation is _not_ a substitute for scripts that ensure that the entered data is in the proper format.
> It's far too easy for someone to make adjustments to the HTML that allow them to bypass the validation, or to remove it entirely.
> It's also possible for someone to bypass your HTML entirely and submit the data directly to your server.
> If your server-side code fails to validate the data it receives, disaster could strike when improperly-formatted data is submitted (or data which is too large, of the wrong type, and so forth).

## Handling browser support

As mentioned above, the major problem with using date inputs at the time of writing is that many major browsers don't yet implement them all; only Chrome/Opera and Edge support it on desktop, and most modern browsers on mobile.
As an example, the `month` picker on Chrome for Android looks like this:

![Month picker on Chrome for Android](month-android.png)

Non-supporting browsers gracefully degrade to a text input, but this creates problems both in terms of consistency of user interface (the presented control will be different), and data handling.

The second problem is the more serious of the two.
As mentioned earlier, with a `month` input the actual value is always normalized to the format `yyyy-mm`.
On the other hand, in its default configuration, a `text` input has no idea what format the date should be in, and this is an issue because of the number of different ways in which people write dates.
For example:

- `mmyyyy` (072022)
- `mm/yyyy` (07/2022)
- `mm-yyyy` (07-2022)
- `yyyy-mm` (2022-07)
- `Month yyyy` (July 2022)
- and so forth…

One way around this is to put a [`pattern`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#pattern) attribute on your `month` input.
Even though the `month` input doesn't use it, if the browser falls back to treating it like a `text` input, the pattern will be used.
For example, try viewing the following demo in a browser that doesn't support `month` inputs:

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <label for="month">
      What month would you like to visit (June to Sept.)?
    </label>
    <input
      id="month"
      type="month"
      name="month"
      min="2022-06"
      max="2022-09"
      required
      pattern="[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}" />
    <span class="validity"></span>
  </div>
  <div>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit form" />
  </div>
</form>
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Handling_browser_support', 600, 100) }}

If you try submitting it, you'll see that the browser now displays an error message (and highlights the input as invalid) if your entry doesn't match the pattern `nnnn-nn`, where `n` is a number from 0 to 9.
Of course, this doesn't stop people from entering invalid dates (such as `0000-42`), or incorrectly formatted dates that follow the pattern.

There's also the problem that the user won't necessarily know which of the many date formats is expected.
We have work left to do.

```css hidden
div {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  position: relative;
}

input[type="number"] {
  width: 100px;
}

input + span {
  padding-right: 30px;
}

input:invalid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✖";
  padding-left: 5px;
}

input:valid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✓";
  padding-left: 5px;
}
```

The best way to deal with dates in forms in a cross-browser way (until all major browsers have supported them for a while) is to get the user to enter the month and year in separate controls ({{htmlelement("select")}} elements being popular; see below for an implementation), or use JavaScript libraries such as the [jQuery date picker](https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/) plugin.

## Examples

In this example, we create two sets of UI elements, each designed to let the user select a month and year.
The first is a native `month` input, and the other is a pair of {{HTMLElement("select")}} elements that allow choosing a month and year independently, for compatibility with browsers that don't yet support `<input type="month">`.

{{EmbedLiveSample('Examples', 600, 140)}}

### HTML

The form that requests the month and year looks like this:

```html
<form>
  <div class="nativeDatePicker">
    <label for="month-visit">What month would you like to visit us?</label>
    <input type="month" id="month-visit" name="month-visit" />
    <span class="validity"></span>
  </div>
  <p class="fallbackLabel">What month would you like to visit us?</p>
  <div class="fallbackDatePicker">
    <div>
      <span>
        <label for="month">Month:</label>
        <select id="month" name="month">
          <option selected>January</option>
          <option>February</option>
          <option>March</option>
          <option>April</option>
          <option>May</option>
          <option>June</option>
          <option>July</option>
          <option>August</option>
          <option>September</option>
          <option>October</option>
          <option>November</option>
          <option>December</option>
        </select>
      </span>
      <span>
        <label for="year">Year:</label>
        <select id="year" name="year"></select>
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>
</form>
```

The {{HTMLElement("div")}} with the ID `nativeDatePicker` uses the `month` input type to request the month and year, while the `<div>` with the ID `fallbackDatePicker` instead uses a pair of `<select>` elements.
The first requests the month, and the second the year.

The `<select>` for choosing the month is hardcoded with the names of the months, as they don't change (leaving localization out of things).
The list of available year values is dynamically generated depending on the current year (see the code comments below for detailed explanations of how these functions work).

```css hidden
div {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  position: relative;
}

input[type="number"] {
  width: 100px;
}

input + span {
  padding-right: 30px;
}

input:invalid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✖";
  padding-left: 5px;
}

input:valid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✓";
  padding-left: 5px;
}
```

### JavaScript

The JavaScript code that handles selecting which approach to use and to set up the list of years to include in the non-native year `<select>` follows.

The part of the example that may be of most interest is the feature detection code.
In order to detect whether the browser supports `<input type="month">`, we create a new {{htmlelement("input")}} element, try setting its `type` to `month`, then immediately check what its type is set to.
Browsers that don't support type `month` will return `text`, since that's What month falls back to when not supported.
If `<input type="month">` is not supported, we hide the native picker and show the fallback picker UI instead.

```js
// Get UI elements
const nativePicker = document.querySelector(".nativeDatePicker");
const fallbackPicker = document.querySelector(".fallbackDatePicker");
const fallbackLabel = document.querySelector(".fallbackLabel");

const yearSelect = document.querySelector("#year");
const monthSelect = document.querySelector("#month");

// Hide fallback initially
fallbackPicker.style.display = "none";
fallbackLabel.style.display = "none";

// Test whether a new date input falls back to a text input or not
const test = document.createElement("input");

try {
  test.type = "month";
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e.description);
}

// If it does, run the code inside the if () {} block
if (test.type === "text") {
  // Hide the native picker and show the fallback
  nativePicker.style.display = "none";
  fallbackPicker.style.display = "block";
  fallbackLabel.style.display = "block";

  // Populate the years dynamically
  // (the months are always the same, therefore hardcoded)
  populateYears();
}

function populateYears() {
  // Get the current year as a number
  const date = new Date();
  const year = date.getFullYear();

  // Make this year, and the 100 years before it available in the year <select>
  for (let i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {
    const option = document.createElement("option");
    option.textContent = year - i;
    yearSelect.appendChild(option);
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Remember that some years have 53 weeks in them (see [Weeks per year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date#Weeks_per_year))!
> You'll need to take this into consideration when developing production apps.

# <input type="number">

{{HTMLElement("input")}} elements of type **`number`** are used to let the user enter a number. They include built-in validation to reject non-numerical entries.

The browser may opt to provide stepper arrows to let the user increase and decrease the value using their mouse or by tapping with a fingertip.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;input type=&quot;number&quot;&gt;", "tabbed-shorter")}}

```html interactive-example
<label for="tentacles">Number of tentacles (10-100):</label>

<input type="number" id="tentacles" name="tentacles" min="10" max="100" />
```

```css interactive-example
label {
  display: block;
  font:
    1rem "Fira Sans",
    sans-serif;
}

input,
label {
  margin: 0.4rem 0;
}
```

On browsers that don't support inputs of type `number`, a `number` input falls back to type `text`.

## Value

A number representing the value of the number entered into the input. You can set a default value for the input by including a number inside the [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) attribute, like so:

```html
<input id="number" type="number" value="42" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Value', 600, 40)}}

## Additional attributes

In addition to the attributes commonly supported by all {{HTMLElement("input")}} types, inputs of type `number` support these attributes.

### `list`

The values of the list attribute is the {{domxref("Element.id", "id")}} of a {{HTMLElement("datalist")}} element located in the same document. The {{HTMLElement("datalist")}} provides a list of predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in the list that are not compatible with the [`type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#type) are not included in the suggested options. The values provided are suggestions, not requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a different value.

### `max`

The maximum value to accept for this input. If the [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) entered into the element exceeds this, the element fails [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation). If the value of the `max` attribute isn't a number, then the element has no maximum value.

This value must be greater than or equal to the value of the `min` attribute.

### `min`

The minimum value to accept for this input. If the [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) of the element is less than this, the element fails [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation). If a value is specified for `min` that isn't a valid number, the input has no minimum value.

This value must be less than or equal to the value of the `max` attribute.

### `placeholder`

The `placeholder` attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of data, rather than an explanatory message. The text _must not_ include carriage returns or line feeds.

If the control's content has one directionality ({{Glossary("LTR")}} or {{Glossary("RTL")}}) but needs to present the placeholder in the opposite directionality, you can use Unicode bidirectional algorithm formatting characters to override directionality within the placeholder; see [How to use Unicode controls for bidi text](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-unicode-controls) for more information.

> [!NOTE]
> Avoid using the `placeholder` attribute if you can. It is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See [`<input>` labels](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#labels) for more information.

### `readonly`

A Boolean attribute which, if present, means this field cannot be edited by the user. Its `value` can, however, still be changed by JavaScript code directly setting the {{domxref("HTMLInputElement")}} `value` property.

> [!NOTE]
> Because a read-only field cannot have a value, `required` does not have any effect on inputs with the `readonly` attribute also specified.

### `step`

The `step` attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to, or the special value `any`, which is described below. Only values which are a whole number of steps from the step base are valid. The step base is [`min`](#min) if specified, [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) otherwise, or `0` if neither is provided.

The default stepping value for `number` inputs is `1`, allowing only integers to be entered—_unless_ the stepping base is not an integer.

A string value of `any` means that no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as [`min`](#min) and [`max`](#max)).

> [!NOTE]
> When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping configuration, the {{Glossary("user agent")}} may round to the nearest valid value, preferring numbers in the positive direction when there are two equally close options.

## Using number inputs

The `number` input type should only be used for incremental numbers, especially when spinbutton incrementing and decrementing are helpful to user experience. The `number` input type is not appropriate for values that happen to only consist of numbers but aren't strictly speaking a number, such as postal codes in many countries or credit card numbers. For non-numeric inputs, consider using a different input type, such as [`<input type="tel">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/tel) or other {{HTMLElement('input')}} type with the [`inputmode`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/inputmode) attribute:

```html
<input type="text" inputmode="numeric" pattern="\d*" />
```

`<input type="number">` elements can help simplify your work when building the user interface and logic for entering numbers into a form. When you create a number input with the proper `type` value, `number`, you get automatic validation that the entered text is a number, and usually a set of up and down buttons to step the value up and down.

> [!WARNING]
> Logically, you should not be able to enter characters inside a number input other than numbers. Some browsers allow invalid characters, others do not; see [Firefox bug 1398528](https://bugzil.la/1398528).

> [!NOTE]
> A user can tinker with your HTML behind the scenes, so your site _must not_ use client-side validation for security purposes. You _must_ verify on the server side any transaction in which the provided value may have security implications of any kind.

Mobile browsers further help with the user experience by showing a special keyboard more suited for entering numbers when the user tries to enter a value.

### A basic number input

In its most basic form, a number input can be implemented like this:

```html
<label for="ticketNum">Number of tickets you would like to buy:</label>
<input id="ticketNum" type="number" name="ticketNum" value="0" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('A_basic_number_input', 600, 40)}}

A number input is considered valid when empty and when a single number is entered, but is otherwise invalid. If the [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#required) attribute is used, the input is no longer considered valid when empty.

> [!NOTE]
> Any number is an acceptable value, as long as it is a [valid floating point number](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/infrastructure.html#valid-floating-point-number) (that is, not [NaN](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NaN) or [Infinity](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Infinity)).

### Placeholders

Sometimes it's helpful to offer an in-context hint as to what form the input data should take. This can be especially important if the page design doesn't offer descriptive labels for each {{HTMLElement("input")}}. This is where **placeholders** come in. A placeholder is a value most commonly used to provide a hint as to the format the input should take `value`. It is displayed inside the edit box when the element's `value` is `""`. Once data is entered into the box, the placeholder disappears; if the box is emptied, the placeholder reappears.

Here, we have an `number` input with the placeholder "Multiple of 10". Note how the placeholder disappears and reappears as you manipulate the contents of the edit field.

```html
<input type="number" placeholder="Multiple of 10" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Placeholders', 600, 40)}}

### Controlling step size

By default, the up and down buttons provided for you to step the number up and down will step the value up and down by 1. You can change this by providing a [`step`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#step) attribute, which takes as its value a number specifying the step amount. Our above example contains a placeholder saying that the value should be a multiple of 10, so it makes sense to add a `step` value of `10`:

```html
<input type="number" placeholder="multiple of 10" step="10" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Controlling_step_size', 600, 40)}}

In this example, you should find that the up and down step arrows will increase and decrease the value by 10 each time, not 1. You can still manually enter a number that's not a multiple of 10, but it will be considered invalid.

### Specifying minimum and maximum values

You can use the [`min`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#min) and [`max`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#max) attributes to specify a minimum and maximum value that the field can have. For example, let's give our example a minimum of `0`, and a maximum of `100`:

```html
<input type="number" placeholder="multiple of 10" step="10" min="0" max="100" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Specifying_minimum_and_maximum_values', 600, 40)}}

In this updated version, you should find that the up and down step buttons will not allow you to go below 0 or above 100. You can still manually enter a number outside these bounds, but it will be considered invalid.

### Allowing decimal values

One issue with number inputs is that their step size is 1 by default. If you try to enter a number with a decimal value that's not a whole number (such as "1.1"), it will be considered invalid. Note that values like "1.0" are considered valid because they are numerically equivalent to whole numbers. If you want to enter values with fractions, you'll need to reflect this in the `step` value (e.g., `step="0.01"` to allow decimals to two decimal places). Here's a basic example:

```html
<input type="number" placeholder="1.0" step="0.01" min="0" max="10" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Allowing_decimal_values", 600, 40)}}

See that this example allows any value between `0.0` and `10.0`, with decimals to two places. For example, "9.52" is valid, but "9.521" is not.

If you want to allow arbitrary decimal values, you can set the `step` value to `"any"`.

### Controlling input size

{{HTMLElement("input")}} elements of type `number` don't support form sizing attributes such as [`size`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#size). You'll have to resort to [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) to change the size of these controls.

For example, to adjust the width of the input to be only as wide as is needed to enter a three-digit number, we can change our HTML to include an [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/id) and to shorten our placeholder since the field will be too narrow for the text we have been using so far:

```html
<input
  type="number"
  placeholder="x10"
  step="10"
  min="0"
  max="100"
  id="number" />
```

Then we add some CSS to narrow the width of the element with the `id` selector `#number`:

```css
#number {
  width: 3em;
}
```

The result looks like this:

{{EmbedLiveSample('Controlling_input_size', 600, 40)}}

### Offering suggested values

You can provide a list of default options from which the user can select by specifying the [`list`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#list) attribute, which contains as its value the [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/id) of a {{HTMLElement("datalist")}}, which in turn contains one {{HTMLElement("option")}} element per suggested value. Each `option`'s `value` is the corresponding suggested value for the number entry box.

```html
<input id="ticketNum" type="number" name="ticketNum" list="defaultNumbers" />
<span class="validity"></span>

<datalist id="defaultNumbers">
  <option value="10045678"></option>
  <option value="103421"></option>
  <option value="11111111"></option>
  <option value="12345678"></option>
  <option value="12999922"></option>
</datalist>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Offering_suggested_values", 600, 40)}}

## Validation

We have already mentioned a number of validation features of `number` inputs, but let's review them now:

- `<input type="number">` elements automatically invalidate any entry that isn't a number (or empty, unless `required` is specified).
- You can use the [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#required) attribute to make an empty entry invalid. (In other words, the input _must_ be filled in.)
- You can use the [`step`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#step) attribute to constrain valid values to a certain set of steps (e.g., multiples of 10).
- You can use the [`min`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#min) and [`max`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#max) attributes to constrain valid values to lower and upper bounds.

The following example exhibits all of the above features, as well as using some CSS to display valid and invalid icons, depending on the `input`'s value:

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <label for="balloons">Number of balloons to order (multiples of 10):</label>
    <input
      id="balloons"
      type="number"
      name="balloons"
      step="10"
      min="0"
      max="100"
      required />
    <span class="validity"></span>
  </div>
  <div>
    <input type="submit" />
  </div>
</form>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Validation", 600, 110)}}

Try submitting the form with different invalid values entered — e.g., no value; a value below 0 or above 100; a value that is not a multiple of 10; or a non-numerical value — and see how the error messages the browser gives you differ with different ones.

The CSS applied to this example is as follows:

```css
div {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

input:invalid + span::after {
  content: "✖";
  padding-left: 5px;
}

input:valid + span::after {
  content: "✓";
  padding-left: 5px;
}
```

Here we use the {{cssxref(":invalid")}} and {{cssxref(":valid")}} pseudo classes to display an appropriate invalid or valid icon as generated content on the adjacent {{htmlelement("span")}} element, as a visual indicator of validity.

We put it on a separate `<span>` element for added flexibility. Some browsers don't display generated content very effectively on some types of form inputs. (Read, for example, the section on [`<input type="date">` validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/date#validation).)

> [!WARNING]
> HTML form validation is _not_ a substitute for server-side scripts that ensure that the entered data is in the proper format!
>
> It's far too easy for someone to make adjustments to the HTML that allow them to bypass the validation, or to remove it entirely. It's also possible for someone to bypass your HTML and submit the data directly to your server.
>
> If your server-side code fails to validate the data it receives, disaster could strike when improperly-formatted data is submitted (or data which is too large, is of the wrong type, and so forth).

### Pattern validation

`<input type="number">` elements do not support use of the [`pattern`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#pattern) attribute for making entered values conform to a specific regex pattern.

The rationale for this is that number inputs won't be valid if they contain anything except numbers, and you can constrain the minimum and maximum number of valid digits using the [`min`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#min) and [`max`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#max) attributes (as explained above).

## Accessibility

The implicit [role](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles) for the `<input type="number">` element is [`spinbutton`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/spinbutton_role). If spinbutton is not an important feature for your form control, consider _not_ using `type="number"`. Instead, use [`inputmode="numeric"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/inputmode) along with a [`pattern`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/pattern) attribute that limits the characters to numbers and associated characters. With `<input type="number">`, there is a risk of users accidentally incrementing a number when they're trying to do something else. Additionally, if users try to enter something that's not a number, there's no explicit feedback about what they're doing wrong.

Also consider using the [`autocomplete`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/autocomplete) attribute to help users complete forms more quickly and with fewer chances of errors. For example, to enable autofill on a zip code field, set `autocomplete="postal-code"`.

## Examples

We've already covered the fact that by default, the increment is `1`, and you can use the [`step`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#step) attribute to allow decimal inputs. Let's take a closer look.

In the following example is a form for entering the user's height. It defaults to accepting a height in meters, but you can click the relevant button to change the form to accept feet and inches instead. The input for the height in meters accepts decimals to two places.

{{EmbedLiveSample("Examples", 600, 150)}}

The HTML looks like this:

```html
<form>
  <div class="metersInputGroup">
    <label for="meters">Enter your height — meters:</label>
    <input
      id="meters"
      type="number"
      name="meters"
      step="0.01"
      min="0"
      placeholder="e.g. 1.78"
      required />
    <span class="validity"></span>
  </div>
  <div class="feetInputGroup">
    <span>Enter your height — </span>
    <label for="feet">feet:</label>
    <input id="feet" type="number" name="feet" min="0" step="1" />
    <span class="validity"></span>
    <label for="inches">inches:</label>
    <input id="inches" type="number" name="inches" min="0" max="11" step="1" />
    <span class="validity"></span>
  </div>
  <div>
    <input
      type="button"
      class="meters"
      value="Enter height in feet and inches" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit form" />
  </div>
</form>
```

You'll see that we are using many of the attributes we've already looked at in the article earlier on. Since we want to accept a meter value in centimeters, we've set the `step` value to `0.01`, so that values like _1.78_ are not seen as invalid. We've also provided a placeholder for that input.

We've hidden the feet and inches inputs initially using `style="display: none;"`, so that meters is the default entry type.

Now, onto the CSS. This looks very similar to the validation styling we saw before; nothing remarkable here.

```css
div {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  position: relative;
}

input[type="number"] {
  width: 100px;
}

input + span {
  padding-right: 30px;
}

input:invalid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✖";
  padding-left: 5px;
}

input:valid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✓";
  padding-left: 5px;
}
```

And finally, the JavaScript:

```js
const metersInputGroup = document.querySelector(".metersInputGroup");
const feetInputGroup = document.querySelector(".feetInputGroup");
const metersInput = document.querySelector("#meters");
const feetInput = document.querySelector("#feet");
const inchesInput = document.querySelector("#inches");
const switchBtn = document.querySelector('input[type="button"]');

feetInputGroup.style.display = "none"; // Hide feet/inches inputs initially

switchBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  if (switchBtn.getAttribute("class") === "meters") {
    switchBtn.setAttribute("class", "feet");
    switchBtn.value = "Enter height in meters";

    metersInputGroup.style.display = "none";
    feetInputGroup.style.display = "block";

    feetInput.setAttribute("required", "");
    inchesInput.setAttribute("required", "");
    metersInput.removeAttribute("required");

    metersInput.value = "";
  } else {
    switchBtn.setAttribute("class", "meters");
    switchBtn.value = "Enter height in feet and inches";

    metersInputGroup.style.display = "block";
    feetInputGroup.style.display = "none";

    feetInput.removeAttribute("required");
    inchesInput.removeAttribute("required");
    metersInput.setAttribute("required", "");

    feetInput.value = "";
    inchesInput.value = "";
  }
});
```

After declaring a few variables, an event listener is added to the `button` to control the switching mechanism. This involves changing over the button's `class` and {{HTMLElement("label")}}, and updating the display values of the two sets of inputs when the button is pressed.

(Note that we're not converting back and forth between meters and feet/inches here, which a real-life web application would probably do.)

> [!NOTE]
> When the user clicks the button, the `required` attribute(s) are removed from the input(s) we are hiding, and empty the `value` attribute(s). This is so the form can be submitted if both input sets aren't filled in. It also ensures that the form won't submit data that the user didn't mean to.
>
> If you didn't do this, you'd have to fill in both feet/inches **and** meters to submit the form!

# <input type="password">

`<input>` elements of type **`password`** provide a way for the user to securely enter a password.

The element is presented as a one-line plain text editor control in which the text is obscured so that it cannot be read, usually by replacing each character with a symbol such as the asterisk ("\*") or a dot ("•").
This character will vary depending on the {{Glossary("user agent")}} and operating system.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;input type=&quot;password&quot;&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<div>
  <label for="username">Username:</label>
  <input type="text" id="username" name="username" />
</div>

<div>
  <label for="pass">Password (8 characters minimum):</label>
  <input type="password" id="pass" name="password" minlength="8" required />
</div>

<input type="submit" value="Sign in" />
```

```css interactive-example
label {
  display: block;
}

input[type="submit"],
label {
  margin-top: 1rem;
}
```

The precise behavior of the entry process may vary from browser to browser.
Some browsers display the typed character for a moment before obscuring it, while others allow the user to toggle the display of plain-text on and off.
Both approaches help a user check that they entered the intended password, which can be particularly difficult on mobile devices.

> [!NOTE]
> Any forms involving sensitive information like passwords (such as login forms) should be served over HTTPS.
> Many browsers now implement mechanisms to warn against insecure login forms; see [Insecure passwords](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Insecure_passwords).

## Value

The [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) attribute contains a string whose value is the current contents of the text editing control being used to enter the password. If the user hasn't entered anything yet, this value is an empty string (`""`). If the [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#required) property is specified, then the password edit box must contain a value other than an empty string to be valid.

If the [`pattern`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#pattern) attribute is specified, the content of a `password` control is only considered valid if the value passes validation; see [Validation](#validation) for more information.

> [!NOTE]
> The line feed (U+000A) and carriage return (U+000D) characters are not permitted in a `password` value. When setting the value of a password control, line feed and carriage return characters are stripped out of the value.

## Additional attributes

In addition to the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes), and the attributes that operate on all {{HTMLElement("input")}} elements regardless of their type, password field inputs support the following attributes.

> [!NOTE]
> The [`autocorrect`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/autocorrect) global attribute can be added to password inputs, but the stored state is always `off`.

### maxlength

The maximum string length (measured in {{glossary("UTF-16", "UTF-16 code units")}}) that the user can enter into the password field. This must be an integer value of 0 or higher. If no `maxlength` is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the password field has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of `minlength`.

The input will fail [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation) if the length of the text entered into the field is greater than `maxlength` {{glossary("UTF-16", "UTF-16 code units")}} long. Constraint validation is only applied when the value is changed by the user.

### minlength

The minimum string length (measured in {{glossary("UTF-16", "UTF-16 code units")}}) that the user can enter into the password entry field. This must be a non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by `maxlength`. If no `minlength` is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the password input has no minimum length.

The input will fail [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation) if the length of the text entered into the field is fewer than `minlength` {{glossary("UTF-16", "UTF-16 code units")}} long. Constraint validation is only applied when the value is changed by the user.

### pattern

The `pattern` attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input's [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) must match for the value to pass [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation). It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the {{jsxref("RegExp")}} type, and as documented in our [guide on regular expressions](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions); the `'u'` flag is specified when compiling the regular expression, so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as {{Glossary("ASCII")}}. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text.

If the specified pattern is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely.

> [!NOTE]
> Use the [`title`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#title) attribute to specify text that most browsers will display as a tooltip to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern. You should also include other explanatory text nearby.

Use of a pattern is strongly recommended for password inputs, in order to help ensure that valid passwords using a wide assortment of character classes are selected and used by your users. With a pattern, you can mandate case rules, require the use of some number of digits and/or punctuation characters, and so forth. See the section [Validation](#validation) for details and an example.

### placeholder

The `placeholder` attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of data, rather than an explanatory message. The text _must not_ include carriage returns or line feeds.

If the control's content has one directionality ({{Glossary("LTR")}} or {{Glossary("RTL")}}) but needs to present the placeholder in the opposite directionality, you can use Unicode bidirectional algorithm formatting characters to override directionality within the placeholder; see [How to use Unicode controls for bidi text](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-unicode-controls) for more information.

> [!NOTE]
> Avoid using the `placeholder` attribute if you can. It is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See [`<input>` labels](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#labels) for more information.

### readonly

A Boolean attribute which, if present, means this field cannot be edited by the user. Its `value` can, however, still be changed from JavaScript code that directly sets the value of the {{domxref("HTMLInputElement","HTMLInputElement.value")}} property.

> [!NOTE]
> Because a read-only field cannot have a value, `required` does not have any effect on inputs with the `readonly` attribute also specified.

### size

The `size` attribute is a numeric value indicating how many characters wide the input field should be. The value must be a number greater than zero, and the default value is 20. Since character widths vary, this may or may not be exact and should not be relied upon to be so; the resulting input may be narrower or wider than the specified number of characters, depending on the characters and the font ({{cssxref("font")}} settings in use).

This does _not_ set a limit on how many characters the user can enter into the field. It only specifies approximately how many can be seen at a time. To set an upper limit on the length of the input data, use the [`maxlength`](#maxlength) attribute.

## Using password inputs

Password input boxes generally work just like other textual input boxes; the main difference is the obscuring of the content to prevent people near the user from reading the password.

### A basic password input

Here we see the most basic password input, with a label established using the {{HTMLElement("label")}} element.

```html
<label for="userPassword">Password: </label>
<input id="userPassword" type="password" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("A_basic_password_input", 600, 40)}}

### Allowing autocomplete

To allow the user's password manager to automatically enter the password, specify the [`autocomplete`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#autocomplete) attribute. For passwords, this should typically be one of the following:

- `on`
  - : Allow the browser or a password manager to automatically fill out the password field. This isn't as informative as using either `current-password` or `new-password`.
- `off`
  - : Don't allow the browser or password manager to automatically fill out the password field. Note that some software ignores this value, since it's typically harmful to users' ability to maintain safe password practices.
- `current-password`
  - : Allow the browser or password manager to enter the current password for the site. This provides more information than `on` does, since it lets the browser or password manager automatically enter currently-known password for the site in the field, but not to suggest a new one.
- `new-password`
  - : Allow the browser or password manager to automatically enter a new password for the site; this is used on "change your password" and "new user" forms, on the field asking the user for a new password. The new password may be generated in a variety of ways, depending on the password manager in use. It may fill in a new suggested password, or it might show the user an interface for creating one.

```html
<label for="userPassword">Password:</label>
<input id="userPassword" type="password" autocomplete="current-password" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Allowing_autocomplete", 600, 40)}}

### Making the password mandatory

To tell the user's browser that the password field must have a valid value before the form can be submitted, specify the Boolean [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#required) attribute.

```html
<label for="userPassword">Password: </label>
<input id="userPassword" type="password" required />
<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Making_the_password_mandatory", 600, 40)}}

### Specifying an input mode

If your recommended (or required) password syntax rules would benefit from an alternate text entry interface than the standard keyboard, you can use the [`inputmode`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#inputmode) attribute to request a specific one. The most obvious use case for this is if the password is required to be numeric (such as a PIN). Mobile devices with virtual keyboards, for example, may opt to switch to a numeric keypad layout instead of a full keyboard, to make entering the password easier. If the PIN is for one-time use, set the [`autocomplete`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#autocomplete) attribute to either `off` or `one-time-code` to suggest that it's not saved.

```html
<label for="pin">PIN: </label>
<input id="pin" type="password" inputmode="numeric" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Specifying_an_input_mode", 600, 40)}}

### Setting length requirements

As usual, you can use the [`minlength`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#minlength) and [`maxlength`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#maxlength) attributes to establish minimum and maximum acceptable lengths for the password. This example expands on the previous one by specifying that the user's PIN must be at least four and no more than eight digits. The [`size`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#size) attribute is used to ensure that the password entry control is eight characters wide.

```html
<label for="pin">PIN:</label>
<input
  id="pin"
  type="password"
  inputmode="numeric"
  minlength="4"
  maxlength="8"
  size="8" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Setting_length_requirements", 600, 40)}}

### Selecting text

As with other textual entry controls, you can use the {{domxref("HTMLInputElement.select", "select()")}} method to select all the text in the password field.

#### HTML

```html
<label for="userPassword">Password: </label>
<input id="userPassword" type="password" size="12" />
<button id="selectAll">Select All</button>
```

#### JavaScript

```js
document.getElementById("selectAll").onclick = () => {
  document.getElementById("userPassword").select();
};
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Selecting_text", 600, 40)}}

You can also use {{domxref("HTMLInputElement.selectionStart", "selectionStart")}} and {{domxref("HTMLInputElement.selectionEnd", "selectionEnd")}} to get (or set) what range of characters in the control are currently selected, and {{domxref("HTMLInputElement.selectionDirection", "selectionDirection")}} to know which direction selection occurred in (or will be extended in, depending on your platform; see its documentation for an explanation). However, given that the text is obscured, the usefulness of these is somewhat limited.

## Validation

If your application has character set restrictions or any other requirement for the actual content of the entered password, you can use the [`pattern`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#pattern) attribute to establish a regular expression to be used to automatically ensure that your passwords meet those requirements.

In this example, only values consisting of at least four and no more than eight hexadecimal digits are valid.

```html
<label for="hexId">Hex ID: </label>
<input
  id="hexId"
  type="password"
  pattern="[0-9a-fA-F]{4,8}"
  title="Enter an ID consisting of 4-8 hexadecimal digits"
  autocomplete="new-password" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Validation", 600, 40)}}

## Examples

### Requesting a Social Security number

This example only accepts input which matches the format for a [valid United States Social Security Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_number#Structure). These numbers, used for tax and identification purposes in the US, are in the form "123-45-6789". Assorted rules for what values are permitted in each group exist as well.

#### HTML

```html
<label for="ssn">SSN:</label>
<input
  type="password"
  id="ssn"
  inputmode="numeric"
  minlength="9"
  maxlength="12"
  pattern="(?!000)([0-6]\d{2}|7([0-6]\d|7[012]))([ -])?(?!00)\d\d\3(?!0000)\d{4}"
  required
  autocomplete="off" />
<br />
<label for="ssn">Value:</label>
<span id="current"></span>
```

This uses a [`pattern`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#pattern) which limits the entered value to strings representing legal Social Security numbers. Obviously, this regexp doesn't guarantee a valid SSN (since we don't have access to the Social Security Administration's database), but it does ensure the number could be one; it generally avoids values that cannot be valid. In addition, it allows the three groups of digits to be separated by a space, a dash ("-"), or nothing.

The [`inputmode`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#inputmode) is set to `numeric` to encourage devices with virtual keyboards to switch to a numeric keypad layout for easier entry. The [`minlength`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#minlength) and [`maxlength`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#maxlength) attributes are set to 9 and 12, respectively, to require that the value be at least nine and no more than 12 characters (the former without separating characters between the groups of digits and the latter with them). The [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#required) attribute is used to indicate that this control must have a value. Finally, [`autocomplete`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#autocomplete) is set to `off` to avoid password managers and session restore features trying to set its value, since this isn't a password at all.

#### JavaScript

The JavaScript displays the entered SSN onscreen so you can see it. This defeats the purpose of a password field, but it helps experiment with the `pattern`.

```js
const ssn = document.getElementById("ssn");
const current = document.getElementById("current");

ssn.oninput = (event) => {
  current.textContent = ssn.value;
};
```

#### Result

# <input type="radio">

{{htmlelement("input")}} elements of type **`radio`** are generally used in **radio groups**—collections of radio buttons describing a set of related options.

Only one radio button in a given group can be selected at the same time. Radio buttons are typically rendered as small circles, which are filled or highlighted when selected.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot;&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<fieldset>
  <legend>Select a maintenance drone:</legend>

  <div>
    <input type="radio" id="huey" name="drone" value="huey" checked />
    <label for="huey">Huey</label>
  </div>

  <div>
    <input type="radio" id="dewey" name="drone" value="dewey" />
    <label for="dewey">Dewey</label>
  </div>

  <div>
    <input type="radio" id="louie" name="drone" value="louie" />
    <label for="louie">Louie</label>
  </div>
</fieldset>
```

```css interactive-example
p,
label {
  font:
    1rem "Fira Sans",
    sans-serif;
}

input {
  margin: 0.4rem;
}
```

They are called radio buttons because they look and operate in a similar manner to the push buttons on old-fashioned radios, such as the one shown below.

![Shows what radio buttons looked like in the olden days.](old-radio.jpg)

> [!NOTE]
> [Checkboxes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/checkbox) are similar to radio buttons, but with an important distinction: radio buttons are designed for selecting one value out of a set, whereas checkboxes let you turn individual values on and off. Where multiple controls exist, radio buttons allow one to be selected out of them all, whereas checkboxes allow multiple values to be selected.

## Value

The `value` attribute is a string containing the radio button's value. The value is never shown to the user by their {{Glossary("user agent")}}. Instead, it's used to identify which radio button in a group is selected.

### Defining a radio group

A radio group is defined by giving each of radio buttons in the group the same [`name`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#name). Once a radio group is established, selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group.

You can have as many radio groups on a page as you like, as long as each has its own unique `name`.

For example, if your form needs to ask the user for their preferred contact method, you might create three radio buttons, each with the `name` property set to `contact` but one with the value `email`, one with the value `phone`, and one with the value `mail`. The user never sees the `value` or the `name` (unless you expressly add code to display it).

The resulting HTML looks like this:

```html
<form>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Please select your preferred contact method:</legend>
    <div>
      <input type="radio" id="contactChoice1" name="contact" value="email" />
      <label for="contactChoice1">Email</label>

      <input type="radio" id="contactChoice2" name="contact" value="phone" />
      <label for="contactChoice2">Phone</label>

      <input type="radio" id="contactChoice3" name="contact" value="mail" />
      <label for="contactChoice3">Mail</label>
    </div>
    <div>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </div>
  </fieldset>
</form>
```

Here you see the three radio buttons, each with the `name` set to `contact` and each with a unique `value` that uniquely identifies that individual radio button within the group. They each also have a unique {{domxref("Element.id", "id")}}, which is used by the {{HTMLElement("label")}} element's [`for`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/label#for) attribute to associate the labels with the radio buttons.

You can try out this example here:

{{EmbedLiveSample('Defining_a_radio_group', 600, 130)}}

### Data representation of a radio group

When the above form is submitted with a radio button selected, the form's data includes an entry in the form `contact=value`. For example, if the user clicks on the "Phone" radio button then submits the form, the form's data will include the line `contact=phone`.

If you omit the `value` attribute in the HTML, the submitted form data assigns the value `on` to the group. In this scenario, if the user clicked on the "Phone" option and submitted the form, the resulting form data would be `contact=on`, which isn't helpful. So don't forget to set your `value` attributes!

> [!NOTE]
> If no radio button is selected when the form is submitted, the radio group is not included in the submitted form data at all, since there is no value to report.

It's fairly uncommon to actually want to allow the form to be submitted without any of the radio buttons in a group selected, so it is usually wise to have one default to the `checked` state. See [Selecting a radio button by default](#selecting_a_radio_button_by_default) below.

Let's add a bit of code to our example so we can examine the data generated by this form. The HTML is revised to add a {{HTMLElement("pre")}} block to output the form data into:

```html
<form>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Please select your preferred contact method:</legend>
    <div>
      <input type="radio" id="contactChoice1" name="contact" value="email" />
      <label for="contactChoice1">Email</label>
      <input type="radio" id="contactChoice2" name="contact" value="phone" />
      <label for="contactChoice2">Phone</label>
      <input type="radio" id="contactChoice3" name="contact" value="mail" />
      <label for="contactChoice3">Mail</label>
    </div>
    <div>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </div>
  </fieldset>
</form>
<pre id="log"></pre>
```

Then we add some [JavaScript](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) to set up an event listener on the {{domxref("HTMLFormElement/submit_event", "submit")}} event, which is sent when the user clicks the "Submit" button:

```js
const form = document.querySelector("form");
const log = document.querySelector("#log");

form.addEventListener("submit", (event) => {
  const data = new FormData(form);
  let output = "";
  for (const entry of data) {
    output = `${output}${entry[0]}=${entry[1]}\r`;
  }
  log.innerText = output;
  event.preventDefault();
});
```

Try this example out and see how there's never more than one result for the `contact` group.

{{EmbedLiveSample("Data_representation_of_a_radio_group", 600, 130)}}

## Additional attributes

In addition to the common attributes shared by all {{HTMLElement("input")}} elements, `radio` inputs support the following attributes.

- `checked`
  - : A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that this radio button is the default selected one in the group.

    Unlike other browsers, Firefox by default [persists the dynamic checked state](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5985839/bug-with-firefox-disabled-attribute-of-input-not-resetting-when-refreshing) of an `<input>` across page loads. Use the [`autocomplete`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#autocomplete) attribute to control this feature.

- `value`
  - : The `value` attribute is one which all {{HTMLElement("input")}}s share; however, it serves a special purpose for inputs of type `radio`: when a form is submitted, only radio buttons which are currently checked are submitted to the server, and the reported value is the value of the `value` attribute. If the `value` is not otherwise specified, it is the string `on` by default. This is demonstrated in the section [Value](#value) above.

- [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/required)
  - : The `required` attribute is one which most {{HTMLElement("input")}}s share. If any radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons has the `required` attribute, a radio button in that group must be checked, although it doesn't have to be the one with the attribute applied.

## Using radio inputs

We already covered the fundamentals of radio buttons above. Let's now look at the other common radio-button-related features and techniques you may need to know about.

### Selecting a radio button by default

To make a radio button selected by default, you include `checked` attribute, as shown in this revised version of the previous example:

```html
<form>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Please select your preferred contact method:</legend>
    <div>
      <input
        type="radio"
        id="contactChoice1"
        name="contact"
        value="email"
        checked />
      <label for="contactChoice1">Email</label>

      <input type="radio" id="contactChoice2" name="contact" value="phone" />
      <label for="contactChoice2">Phone</label>

      <input type="radio" id="contactChoice3" name="contact" value="mail" />
      <label for="contactChoice3">Mail</label>
    </div>
    <div>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </div>
  </fieldset>
</form>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Selecting_a_radio_button_by_default', 600, 130)}}

In this case, the first radio button is now selected by default.

> [!NOTE]
> If you put the `checked` attribute on more than one radio button, later instances will override earlier ones; that is, the last `checked` radio button will be the one that is selected. This is because only one radio button in a group can ever be selected at once, and the user agent automatically deselects others each time a new one is marked as checked.

### Providing a bigger hit area for your radio buttons

In the above examples, you may have noticed that you can select a radio button by clicking on its associated {{htmlelement("label")}} element, as well as on the radio button itself. This is a really useful feature of HTML form labels that makes it easier for users to click the option they want, especially on small-screen devices like smartphones.

Beyond accessibility, this is another good reason to properly set up `<label>` elements on your forms.

## Validation

In the case of a radio button with the [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/required) attribute set, or a same-named group of radio buttons in which at least one member has `required` set, a radio button needs to be selected for the control to be considered valid. If no radio button is checked, the [`valueMissing`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/valueMissing) property of a {{domxref("ValidityState")}} object will return `true` during validation, and the browser will ask the user to select an option.

## Styling radio inputs

The following example shows a slightly more thorough version of the example we've seen throughout the article, with some additional styling, and with better semantics established through use of specialized elements. The HTML looks like this:

```html
<form>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Please select your preferred contact method:</legend>
    <div>
      <input
        type="radio"
        id="contactChoice1"
        name="contact"
        value="email"
        checked />
      <label for="contactChoice1">Email</label>

      <input type="radio" id="contactChoice2" name="contact" value="phone" />
      <label for="contactChoice2">Phone</label>

      <input type="radio" id="contactChoice3" name="contact" value="mail" />
      <label for="contactChoice3">Mail</label>
    </div>
    <div>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </div>
  </fieldset>
</form>
```

The CSS involved in this example is a bit more significant:

```

Most notable here is the use of the {{cssxref("appearance")}} property (with prefixes needed to support some browsers). By default, radio buttons (and [checkboxes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/checkbox)) are styled with the operating system's native styles for those controls. By specifying `appearance: none`, you can remove the native styling altogether, and create your own styles for them. Here we've used a {{cssxref("border")}} along with {{cssxref("border-radius")}} and a {{cssxref("transition")}} to create a nice animating radio selection. Notice also how the {{cssxref(":checked")}} pseudo-class is used to specify the styles for the radio button's appearance when selected.

> [!NOTE]
> If you wish to use the {{cssxref("appearance")}} property, you should test it very carefully. Although it is supported in most modern browsers, its implementation varies widely. In older browsers, even the keyword `none` does not have the same effect across different browsers, and some do not support it at all. The differences are smaller in the newest browsers.

{{EmbedLiveSample('Styling_radio_inputs', 600, 120)}}

Notice that when clicking on a radio button, there's a nice, smooth fade out/in effect as the two buttons change state. In addition, the style and coloring of the legend and submit button are customized to have strong contrast. This might not be a look you'd want in a real web application, but it definitely shows off the possibilities.

# <input type="range">

{{HTMLElement("input")}} elements of type **`range`** let the user specify a numeric value which must be no less than a given value, and no more than another given value. The precise value, however, is not considered important. This is typically represented using a slider or dial control rather than a text entry box like the {{HTMLElement('input/number', 'number')}} input type.

Because this kind of widget is imprecise, it should only be used if the control's exact value isn't important.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;input type=&quot;range&quot;&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<p>Audio settings:</p>

<div>
  <input type="range" id="volume" name="volume" min="0" max="11" />
  <label for="volume">Volume</label>
</div>

<div>
  <input
    type="range"
    id="cowbell"
    name="cowbell"
    min="0"
    max="100"
    value="90"
    step="10" />
  <label for="cowbell">Cowbell</label>
</div>
```

```css interactive-example
p,
label {
  font:
    1rem "Fira Sans",
    sans-serif;
}

input {
  margin: 0.4rem;
}
```

If the user's browser doesn't support type `range`, it will fall back and treat it as a `{{HTMLElement('input/text', 'text')}}` input.

## Value

The value of an `<input type="range">` element is set using the [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) attribute which accepts a string representing the selected number. The value is never an empty string (`""`). The default value is halfway between the specified minimum and maximum—unless the maximum is actually less than the minimum, in which case the default is set to the value of the `min` attribute. The algorithm for determining the default value is:

```js
defaultValue =
  rangeElem.max < rangeElem.min
    ? rangeElem.min
    : rangeElem.min + (rangeElem.max - rangeElem.min) / 2;
```

If an attempt is made to set the value lower than the minimum, it is set to the minimum. Similarly, an attempt to set the value higher than the maximum results in it being set to the maximum.

### Validation

There is no pattern validation available; however, the following forms of automatic validation are performed:

- If the [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) is set to something which can't be converted into a valid floating-point number, validation fails because the input is suffering from a bad input.
- The value won't be less than [`min`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#min). The default is 0.
- The value won't be greater than [`max`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#max). The default is 100.
- The value will be a multiple of [`step`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#step). The default is 1.

## Additional attributes

In addition to the attributes shared by all {{HTMLElement("input")}} elements, range inputs offer the following attributes.

> [!NOTE]
> The following input attributes do not apply to the input range: `accept`, `alt`, `checked`, `dirname`, `formaction`, `formenctype`, `formmethod`, `formnovalidate`, `formtarget`, `height`, `maxlength`, `minlength`, `multiple`, `pattern`, `placeholder`, `readonly`, `required`, `size`, and `src`. Any of these attributes, if included, will be ignored.

### list

The value of the `list` attribute is the {{domxref("Element.id", "id")}} of a {{HTMLElement("datalist")}} element located in the same document. The {{HTMLElement("datalist")}} provides a list of predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in the list that are not compatible with the [`type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#type) are not included in the suggested options. The values provided are suggestions, not requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a different value.

See the [adding tick marks](#adding_tick_marks) below for an example of how the options on a range are denoted in supported browsers.

### max

The greatest value in the range of permitted values. If the [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) entered into the element exceeds this, the element fails [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation). If the value of the [`max`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/max) attribute isn't a number, then the element has no maximum value.

This value must be greater than or equal to the value of the [`min`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/min) attribute. See the HTML [`max`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/max) attribute.

### min

The lowest value in the range of permitted values. If the [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) of the element is less than this, the element fails [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation). If a value is specified for `min` that isn't a valid number, the input has no minimum value.

This value must be less than or equal to the value of the [`max`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/max) attribute. See the HTML [`min`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/min) attribute.

> [!NOTE]
> If the `min` and `max` values are equal or the `max` value is lower than the `min` value the user will not be able to interact with the range.

### step

The `step` attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to, or the special value `any`, which is described below. Only values which are a whole number of steps from the step base are valid. The step base is [`min`](#min) if specified, [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) otherwise, or `0` if neither is provided.

The default stepping value for `step` inputs is `1`, allowing only integers to be entered—_unless_ the stepping base is not an integer.

A string value of `any` means that no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as [`min`](#min) and [`max`](#max)). See the [Setting step to the `any` value](#setting_step_to_any) example for how this works in supported browsers.

> [!NOTE]
> When the value entered by a user doesn't adhere to the stepping configuration, the {{Glossary("user agent")}} may round off the value to the nearest valid value, preferring to round numbers up when there are two equally close options.

## Non-standard attributes

### orient

Similar to the -moz-orient non-standard CSS property impacting the {{htmlelement('progress')}} and {{htmlelement('meter')}} elements, the `orient` attribute defines the orientation of the range slider. Values include `horizontal`, meaning the range is rendered horizontally, and `vertical`, where the range is rendered vertically.

## Examples

While the `number` type lets users enter a number with optional constraints forcing their value to be between a minimum and a maximum value, it does require that they enter a specific value. The `range` input type lets you ask the user for a value in cases where the user may not even care—or know—what the specific numeric value selected is.

A few examples of situations in which range inputs are commonly used:

- Audio controls such as volume and balance, or filter controls.
- Color configuration controls such as color channels, transparency, brightness, etc.
- Game configuration controls such as difficulty, visibility distance, world size, and so forth.
- Password length for a password manager's generated passwords.

As a rule, if the user is more likely to be interested in the percentage of the distance between minimum and maximum values than the actual number itself, a range input is a great candidate. For example, in the case of a home stereo volume control, users typically think "set volume at halfway to maximum" instead of "set volume to 0.5".

### Specifying the minimum and maximum

By default, the minimum is 0 and the maximum is 100. If that's not what you want, you can easily specify different bounds by changing the values of the [`min`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#min) and/or [`max`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#max) attributes. These can be any floating-point value.

For example, to ask the user for a value between -10 and 10, you can use:

```html
<input type="range" min="-10" max="10" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Specifying_the_minimum_and_maximum", 600, 40)}}

### Setting the value's granularity

By default, the granularity is 1, meaning the value is always an integer. To control the granularity, you can change the [`step`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#step) attribute. For example, If you need a value to be halfway between 5 and 10, you should set the value of `step` to 0.5:

#### Setting the step attribute

```html
<input type="range" min="5" max="10" step="0.5" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Setting_the_step_attribute", 600, 40)}}

#### Setting step to `any`

If you want to accept any value regardless of how many decimal places it extends to, you can specify a value of `any` for the [`step`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#step) attribute:

##### HTML

```html
<input id="pi_input" type="range" min="0" max="3.14" step="any" />
<p>Value: <output id="value"></output></p>
```

##### JavaScript

```js
const value = document.querySelector("#value");
const input = document.querySelector("#pi_input");
value.textContent = input.value;
input.addEventListener("input", (event) => {
  value.textContent = event.target.value;
});
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Setting_step_to_any", 600, 75)}}

This example lets the user select any value between 0 and π without any restriction on the fractional part of the value selected. JavaScript is used to show how the value changes as the user interacts with the range.

### Adding tick marks

To add tick marks to a range control, include the `list` attribute, giving it the `id` of a {{HTMLElement("datalist")}} element which defines a series of tick marks on the control. Each point is represented using an {{HTMLElement("option")}} element with its [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/option#value) set to the range's value at which a mark should be drawn.

#### HTML

```html
<label for="temp">Choose a comfortable temperature:</label><br />
<input type="range" id="temp" name="temp" list="markers" />

<datalist id="markers">
  <option value="0"></option>
  <option value="25"></option>
  <option value="50"></option>
  <option value="75"></option>
  <option value="100"></option>
</datalist>
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Adding tick marks", 600, 50)}}

### Using the same datalist for multiple range controls

To help you from repeating code you can reuse that same {{HTMLElement("datalist")}} for multiple `<input type="range">` elements, and other {{HTMLElement("input")}} types.

> [!NOTE]
> If you also want to [show the labels](#adding_labels) as in the example below then you would need a `datalist` for each range input.

#### HTML

```html
<p>
  <label for="temp1">Temperature for room 1:</label>
  <input type="range" id="temp1" name="temp1" list="values" />
</p>
<p>
  <label for="temp2">Temperature for room 2:</label>
  <input type="range" id="temp2" name="temp2" list="values" />
</p>

<p>
  <label for="temp3">Temperature for room 3:</label>
  <input type="range" id="temp3" name="temp3" list="values" />
</p>

<datalist id="values">
  <option value="0" label="0"></option>
  <option value="25" label="25"></option>
  <option value="50" label="50"></option>
  <option value="75" label="75"></option>
  <option value="100" label="100"></option>
</datalist>
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Using the same datalist for multiple range controls")}}

### Adding labels

You can label tick marks by giving the `<option>` elements `label` attributes. However, the label content will not be displayed by default. You can use CSS to show the labels and to position them correctly. Here's one way you could do this.

#### HTML

```html
<label for="tempB">Choose a comfortable temperature:</label><br />
<input type="range" id="tempB" name="temp" list="values" />

<datalist id="values">
  <option value="0" label="very cold!"></option>
  <option value="25" label="cool"></option>
  <option value="50" label="medium"></option>
  <option value="75" label="getting warm!"></option>
  <option value="100" label="hot!"></option>
</datalist>
```

#### CSS

```css
datalist {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: space-between;
  writing-mode: vertical-lr;
  width: 200px;
}

option {
  padding: 0;
}

input[type="range"] {
  width: 200px;
  margin: 0;
}
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Adding labels")}}

### Creating vertical range controls

By default, browsers render range inputs as sliders with the knob sliding left and right.

To create a vertical range wherein the thumb slides up and down, set the {{cssxref("writing-mode")}} property with a value of either `vertical-rl` or `vertical-lr`:

```html hidden
<input type="range" min="0" max="10" value="8" />
```

```css
input[type="range"] {
  writing-mode: vertical-lr;
}
```

This causes the range slider to render vertically:

{{EmbedLiveSample("Creating vertical range controls", 200, 200)}}

You can also set the CSS {{cssxref('appearance')}} property to the non-standard `slider-vertical` value if you want to support older versions of Chrome and Safari, and include the non-standard `orient="vertical"` attribute to support older versions of Firefox.

See [Creating vertical form controls](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_writing_modes/Vertical_controls) for examples.

# <input type="reset">

{{HTMLElement("input")}} elements of type **`reset`** are rendered as buttons, with a default {{domxref("Element/click_event", "click")}} event handler that resets all inputs in the form to their initial values.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;input type=&quot;reset&quot;&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<form>
  <div class="controls">
    <label for="id">User ID:</label>
    <input type="text" id="id" name="id" />

    <input type="reset" value="Reset" />

}

label {
  font-size: 0.8rem;
  justify-self: end;
}

input[type="reset"],
input[type="submit"] {
  width: 5rem;
  justify-self: end;
}

input[type="reset"] {
  grid-column: 2;
  grid-row: 2;
}

input[type="submit"] {
  grid-column: 2;
  grid-row: 3;
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> You should usually avoid including reset buttons in your forms. They're rarely useful, and are instead more likely to frustrate users who click them by mistake (often while trying to click the [submit button](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/submit)).

## Value

An `<input type="reset">` element's [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) attribute contains a string that is used as the button's label providing the button with an {{glossary("accessible description")}}. Buttons such as `reset` don't have a value otherwise.

### Setting the value attribute

```html
<input type="reset" value="Reset the form" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Setting_the_value_attribute", 650, 30)}}

### Omitting the value attribute

If you don't specify a `value`, you get a button with the default label (typically "Reset," but this will vary depending on the {{Glossary("user agent")}}):

```html
<input type="reset" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Omitting_the_value_attribute", 650, 30)}}

## Using reset buttons

`<input type="reset">` buttons are used to reset forms. If you want to create a custom button and then customize the behavior using JavaScript, you need to use [`<input type="button">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/button), or better still, a {{htmlelement("button")}} element.

### A basic reset button

We'll begin by creating a basic reset button:

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <label for="example">Type in some sample text</label>
    <input id="example" type="text" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <input type="reset" value="Reset the form" />
  </div>
</form>
```

This renders like so:

{{EmbedLiveSample("A_basic_reset_button", 650, 100)}}

Try entering some text into the text field, and then pressing the reset button.

### Adding a reset keyboard shortcut

To add a keyboard shortcut to a reset button — just as you would with any {{HTMLElement("input")}} for which it makes sense — you use the [`accesskey`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/accesskey) global attribute.

In this example, <kbd>r</kbd> is specified as the access key (you'll need to press <kbd>r</kbd> plus the particular modifier keys for your browser/OS combination; see [`accesskey`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/accesskey) for a useful list of those).

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <label for="example">Type in some sample text</label>
    <input id="example" type="text" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <input type="reset" value="Reset the form" accesskey="r" />
  </div>
</form>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Adding_a_reset_keyboard_shortcut", 650, 100)}}

The problem with the above example is that there's no way for the user to know what the access key is! This is especially true since the modifiers are typically non-standard to avoid conflicts. When building a site, be sure to provide this information in a way that doesn't interfere with the site design (for example by providing an easily accessible link that points to information on what the site access keys are). Adding a tooltip to the button (using the [`title`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/title) attribute) can also help, although it's not a complete solution for accessibility purposes.

### Disabling and enabling a reset button

To disable a reset button, specify the [`disabled`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#disabled) attribute on it, like so:

```html
<input type="reset" value="Disabled" disabled />
```

You can enable and disable buttons at run time by setting `disabled` to `true` or `false`; in JavaScript this looks like `btn.disabled = true` or `btn.disabled = false`.

> [!NOTE]
> See the [`<input type="button">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/button#disabling_and_enabling_a_button) page for more ideas about enabling and disabling buttons.

## Validation

Buttons don't participate in constraint validation; they have no real value to be constrained.

## Examples

We've included basic examples above. There isn't really anything more to say about reset buttons.

# <input type="search">

{{HTMLElement("input")}} elements of type **`search`** are text fields designed for the user to enter search queries into. These are functionally identical to [`text`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/text) inputs, but may be styled differently by the {{Glossary("user agent")}}.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;input type=&quot;search&quot;&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<label for="site-search">Search the site:</label>
<input type="search" id="site-search" name="q" />

<button>Search</button>
```

```css interactive-example
label {
  display: block;
  font:
    1rem "Fira Sans",
    sans-serif;
}

input,
label {
  margin: 0.4rem 0;
}
```

## Value

The [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) attribute contains a string representing the value contained in the search field. You can retrieve this using the [`HTMLInputElement.value`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/value) property in JavaScript.

```js
searchTerms = mySearch.value;
```

If no validation constraints are in place for the input (see [Validation](#validation) for more details), the value can be any text string or an empty string (`""`).

## Additional attributes

In addition to the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes) and the attributes that operate on all {{HTMLElement("input")}} elements regardless of their type, search field inputs support the following attributes.

### list

The values of the list attribute is the {{domxref("Element.id", "id")}} of a {{HTMLElement("datalist")}} element located in the same document. The {{HTMLElement("datalist")}} provides a list of predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in the list that are not compatible with the [`type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#type) are not included in the suggested options. The values provided are suggestions, not requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a different value.

### maxlength

The maximum string length (measured in {{glossary("UTF-16", "UTF-16 code units")}}) that the user can enter into the search field. This must be an integer value of 0 or higher. If no `maxlength` is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the search field has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of `minlength`.

The input will fail [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation) if the length of the text entered into the field is greater than `maxlength` {{glossary("UTF-16", "UTF-16 code units")}} long. Constraint validation is only applied when the value is changed by the user.

### minlength

The minimum string length (measured in {{glossary("UTF-16", "UTF-16 code units")}}) that the user can enter into the search field. This must be a non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by `maxlength`. If no `minlength` is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the search input has no minimum length.

The search field will fail [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation) if the length of the text entered into the field is fewer than `minlength` {{glossary("UTF-16", "UTF-16 code units")}} long. Constraint validation is only applied when the value is changed by the user.

### pattern

The `pattern` attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input's [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) must match for the value to pass [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation). It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the {{jsxref("RegExp")}} type, and as documented in our [guide on regular expressions](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions); the `'u'` flag is specified when compiling the regular expression so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as {{Glossary("ASCII")}}. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text.

If the specified pattern is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely.

> [!NOTE]
> Use the [`title`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#title) attribute to specify text that most browsers will display as a tooltip to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern. You should also include other explanatory text nearby.

See the section [Specifying a pattern](#specifying_a_pattern) for details and an example.

### placeholder

The `placeholder` attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of data, rather than an explanatory message. The text _must not_ include carriage returns or line feeds.

If the control's content has one directionality ({{Glossary("LTR")}} or {{Glossary("RTL")}}) but needs to present the placeholder in the opposite directionality, you can use Unicode bidirectional algorithm formatting characters to override directionality within the placeholder; see [How to use Unicode controls for bidi text](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-unicode-controls) for more information.

> [!NOTE]
> Avoid using the `placeholder` attribute if you can. It is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See [`<input>` labels](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#labels) for more information.

### readonly

A Boolean attribute which, if present, means this field cannot be edited by the user. Its `value` can, however, still be changed by JavaScript code directly setting the {{domxref("HTMLInputElement")}} `value` property.

> [!NOTE]
> Because a read-only field cannot have a value, `required` does not have any effect on inputs with the `readonly` attribute also specified.

### size

The `size` attribute is a numeric value indicating how many characters wide the input field should be. The value must be a number greater than zero, and the default value is 20. Since character widths vary, this may or may not be exact and should not be relied upon to be so; the resulting input may be narrower or wider than the specified number of characters, depending on the characters and the font ({{cssxref("font")}} settings in use).

This does _not_ set a limit on how many characters the user can enter into the field. It only specifies approximately how many can be seen at a time. To set an upper limit on the length of the input data, use the [`maxlength`](#maxlength) attribute.

### spellcheck

[`spellcheck`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/spellcheck) is a global attribute that is used to indicate whether to enable spell-checking for an element. It can be used on any editable content, but here we consider specifics related to the use of `spellcheck` on {{HTMLElement("input")}} elements. The permitted values for `spellcheck` are:

- `false`
  - : Disable spell-checking for this element.
- `true`
  - : Enable spell-checking for this element.
- "" (empty string) or no value
  - : Follow the element's default behavior for spell-checking. This may be based upon a parent's `spellcheck` setting or other factors.

An input field can have spell-checking enabled if it doesn't have the [readonly](#readonly) attribute set and is not disabled.

The value returned by reading `spellcheck` may not reflect the actual state of spell-checking within a control, if the {{Glossary("user agent", "user agent's")}} preferences override the setting.

## Non-standard attributes

The following non-standard attributes are available to search input fields.
Avoid using them where possible.

### incremental

The Boolean attribute `incremental` is a WebKit and Blink extension (so supported by Safari, Opera, Chrome, etc.) which, if present, tells the {{Glossary("user agent")}} to process the input as a live search. As the user edits the value of the field, the user agent sends {{domxref("HTMLInputElement/search_event", "search")}} events to the {{domxref("HTMLInputElement")}} object representing the search box. This allows your code to update the search results in real time as the user edits the search.

If `incremental` is not specified, the {{domxref("HTMLInputElement/search_event", "search")}} event is only sent when the user explicitly initiates a search (such as by pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Return</kbd> key while editing the field).

The `search` event is rate-limited so that it is not sent more frequently than an implementation-defined interval.

### results

The `results` attribute—supported only by Safari—is a numeric value that lets you override the maximum number of entries to be displayed in the {{HTMLElement("input")}} element's natively-provided drop-down menu of previous search queries.

The value must be a non-negative decimal number. If not provided, or an invalid value is given, the browser's default maximum number of entries is used.

## Using search inputs

`<input>` elements of type `search` are very similar to those of type `text`, except that they are specifically intended for handling search terms. They are basically equivalent in behavior, but user agents may choose to style them differently by default (and, of course, sites may use stylesheets to apply custom styles to them).

### Basic example

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <input type="search" id="mySearch" name="q" />
    <button>Search</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

This renders like so:

{{EmbedLiveSample("Basic_example", 600, 40)}}

`q` is the most common `name` given to search inputs, although it's not mandatory. When submitted, the data name/value pair sent to the server will be `q=searchTerm`.

> [!NOTE]
> You must remember to set a [`name`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#name) for your input, otherwise nothing will be submitted.

### Differences between search and text types

The main basic differences come in the way browsers handle them. The first thing to note is that some browsers show a cross icon that can be clicked on to remove the search term instantly if desired, in Chrome this action is also triggered when pressing escape. The following screenshot comes from Chrome:

![Focused search input, with focus ring, with the text 'cats'. There is an x icon in the input abutting the right side.](chrome-cross-icon.png)

In addition, modern browsers also tend to automatically store search terms previously entered across domains, which then come up as autocomplete options when subsequent searches are performed in search inputs on that domain. This helps users who tend to do searches on the same or similar search queries over time. This screenshot is from Firefox:

![An input in error state with a red focus ring. The user has entered the letter 'h'. A pop-up selection list is open directly under the input box with two options: hello and hermansje.](firefox-auto-complete.png)

At this point, let's look at some useful techniques you can apply to your search forms.

### Setting placeholders

You can provide a useful placeholder inside your search input that could give a hint on what to do using the [`placeholder`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#placeholder) attribute. Look at the following example:

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <input
      type="search"
      id="mySearch"
      name="q"
      placeholder="Search the site…" />
    <button>Search</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

You can see how the placeholder is rendered below:

{{EmbedLiveSample("Setting_placeholders", 600, 40)}}

### Search form labels and accessibility

One problem with search forms is their accessibility; a common design practice is not to provide a label for the search field (although there might be a magnifying glass icon or similar), as the purpose of a search form is normally fairly obvious for sighted users due to placement ([this example shows a typical pattern](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/aria/website-aria-roles/)).

This could, however, cause confusion for screen reader users, as they will not receive any verbal indication of what the search input is. One way around this that won't impact your visual design is to use [landmark elements](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/landmark_role).

- Wrap the whole search functionality in a {{HTMLElement("search")}} element, which creates a landmark region that assistive technologies can announce and quickly navigate to. If your `<input>` is already in a `<form>`, you can alternatively add [`role="search"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/search_role) to the `<form>` element, which also makes the `<form>` a search landmark. The `<search>` element uses native HTML semantics, while `role="search"` has more support and may be terser to type if you already have a `<form>` wrapper.
- If that isn't enough, you can use an [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) attribute on the {{HTMLElement("input")}} itself. This should be a descriptive text label that will be read out by the screen reader; it's used as a non-visual equivalent to `<label>`.

Let's have a look at an example:

```html
<search>
  <form>
    <div>
      <input
        type="search"
        id="mySearch"
        name="q"
        placeholder="Search the site…"
        aria-label="Search through site content" />
      <button>Search</button>
    </div>
  </form>
</search>
```

You can see how this is rendered below:

{{EmbedLiveSample("Search_form_labels_and_accessibility", 600, 40)}}

There is no visual difference from the previous example, but screen reader users have way more information available to them.

> [!NOTE]
> See [Signposts/Landmarks](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/WAI-ARIA_basics#signpostslandmarks) for more information about such accessibility features.

### Physical input element size

The physical size of the input box can be controlled using the [`size`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#size) attribute. With it, you can specify the number of characters the input box can display at a time. In this example, for instance, the search box is 30 characters wide:

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <input
      type="search"
      id="mySearch"
      name="q"
      placeholder="Search the site…"
      size="30" />
    <button>Search</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

The result is this wider input box:

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Physical_input_element_size', 600, 40) }}

## Validation

`<input>` elements of type `search` have the same validation features available to them as regular `text` inputs. It is less likely that you'd want to use validation features in general for search boxes. In many cases, users should just be allowed to search for anything, but there are a few cases to consider, such as searches against data of a known format.

> [!NOTE]
> HTML form validation is _not_ a substitute for scripts that ensure that the entered data is in the proper format. It's far too easy for someone to make adjustments to the HTML that allow them to bypass the validation, or to remove it entirely. It's also possible for someone to bypass your HTML entirely and submit the data directly to your server. If your server-side code fails to validate the data it receives, disaster could strike when improperly-formatted data (or data which is too large, is of the wrong type, and so forth) is entered into your database.

### A note on styling

There are useful pseudo-classes available for styling valid/invalid form elements: {{cssxref(":valid")}} and {{cssxref(":invalid")}}. In this section, we'll use the following CSS, which will place a check (tick) next to inputs containing valid values, and a cross next to inputs containing invalid values.

```css
input:invalid ~ span::after {
  content: "✖";
  padding-left: 5px;
  position: absolute;
}

input:valid ~ span::after {
  content: "✓";
  padding-left: 5px;
  position: absolute;
}
```

The technique also requires a {{htmlelement("span")}} element to be placed after the form element, which acts as a holder for the icons. This was necessary because some input types on some browsers don't display icons placed directly after them very well.

### Making input required

You can use the [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#required) attribute as an easy way of making entering a value required before form submission is allowed:

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <input
      type="search"
      id="mySearch"
      name="q"
      placeholder="Search the site…"
      required />
    <button>Search</button>
    <span class="validity"></span>
  </div>
</form>
```

```css hidden
input {
  margin-right: 10px;
}

input:invalid ~ span::after {
  content: "✖";
  padding-left: 5px;
  position: absolute;
}

input:valid ~ span::after {
  content: "✓";
  padding-left: 5px;
  position: absolute;
}
```

This renders like so:

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Making_input_required', 600, 40) }}

In addition, if you try to submit the form with no search term entered into it, the browser will show a message. The following example is from Firefox:

![form field with attached message that says Please fill out this field](firefox-required-message.png)

Different messages will be shown when you try to submit the form with different types of invalid data contained inside the inputs; see the below examples.

### Input value length

You can specify a minimum length, in characters, for the entered value using the [`minlength`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#minlength) attribute; similarly, use [`maxlength`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#maxlength) to set the maximum length of the entered value.

The example below requires that the entered value be 4–8 characters in length.

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <label for="mySearch">Search for user</label>
    <input
      type="search"
      id="mySearch"
      name="q"
      placeholder="User IDs are 4–8 characters in length"
      required
      size="30"
      minlength="4"
      maxlength="8" />
    <button>Search</button>
    <span class="validity"></span>
  </div>
</form>
```

```css hidden
input {
  margin-right: 10px;
}

input:invalid ~ span::after {
  content: "✖";
  padding-left: 5px;
  position: absolute;
}

input:valid ~ span::after {
  content: "✓";
  padding-left: 5px;
  position: absolute;
}
```

This renders like so:

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Input_value_length', 600, 40) }}

If you try to submit the form with less than 4 characters, you'll be given an appropriate error message (which differs between browsers). If you try to go beyond 8 characters in length, the browser won't let you.

### Specifying a pattern

You can use the [`pattern`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#pattern) attribute to specify a regular expression that the inputted value must follow to be considered valid (see [Validating against a regular expression](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Form_validation#validating_against_a_regular_expression) for a crash course).

Let's look at an example. Say we wanted to provide a product ID search form, and the IDs were all codes of two letters followed by four numbers. The following example covers it:

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <label for="mySearch">Search for product by ID:</label>
    <input
      type="search"
      id="mySearch"
      name="q"
      placeholder="two letters followed by four numbers"
      required
      size="30"
      pattern="[A-z]{2}[0-9]{4}" />
    <button>Search</button>
    <span class="validity"></span>
  </div>
</form>
```

```css hidden
input {
  margin-right: 10px;
}

input:invalid ~ span::after {
  content: "✖";
  padding-left: 5px;
  position: absolute;
}

input:valid ~ span::after {
  content: "✓";
  padding-left: 5px;
  position: absolute;
}
```

This renders like so:

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Specifying_a_pattern', 600, 40) }}

## See also

- [HTML Forms](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms)
- {{HTMLElement("input")}} and the {{domxref("HTMLInputElement")}} interface it's based upon
- [`<input type="text">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/text)
# <input type="submit">

{{HTMLElement("input")}} elements of type **`submit`** are rendered as buttons. When the {{domxref("Element/click_event", "click")}} event occurs (typically because the user clicked the button), the {{Glossary("user agent")}} attempts to submit the form to the server.

## Value

An `<input type="submit">` element's [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) attribute contains a string which is displayed as the button's label. Buttons do not have a true value otherwise. The `value` provides the {{glossary("accessible description")}} for the button.

### Setting the value attribute

```html
<input type="submit" value="Send Request" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Setting_the_value_attribute", 650, 30)}}

### Omitting the value attribute

If you don't specify a `value`, the button will have a default label, chosen by the user agent. This label is likely to be something along the lines of "Submit" or "Submit Query." Here's an example of a submit button with a default label in your browser:

```html
<input type="submit" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Omitting_the_value_attribute", 650, 30)}}

## Additional attributes

In addition to the attributes shared by all {{HTMLElement("input")}} elements, `submit` button inputs support the following attributes.

### formaction

A string indicating the URL to which to submit the data. This takes precedence over the [`action`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#action) attribute on the {{HTMLElement("form")}} element that owns the {{HTMLElement("input")}}.

This attribute is also available on [`<input type="image">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/image) and {{HTMLElement("button")}} elements.

### formenctype

A string that identifies the encoding method to use when submitting the form data to the server. There are three permitted values:

- `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
  - : This, the default value, sends the form data as a string after {{Glossary("Percent-encoding", "percent-encoding")}} the text using an algorithm such as {{jsxref("encodeURI", "encodeURI()")}}.
- `multipart/form-data`
  - : Uses the {{domxref("FormData")}} API to manage the data, allowing for files to be submitted to the server. You _must_ use this encoding type if your form includes any {{HTMLElement("input")}} elements of [`type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#type) `file` ([`<input type="file">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/file)).
- `text/plain`
  - : Plain text; mostly useful only for debugging, so you can easily see the data that's to be submitted.

If specified, the value of the `formenctype` attribute overrides the owning form's [`enctype`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#enctype) attribute.

This attribute is also available on [`<input type="image">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/image) and {{HTMLElement("button")}} elements.

### formmethod

A string indicating the HTTP method to use when submitting the form's data; this value overrides any [`method`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#method) attribute given on the owning form. Permitted values are:

- `get`
  - : A URL is constructed by starting with the URL given by the `formaction` or [`action`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#action) attribute, appending a question mark ("?") character, then appending the form's data, encoded as described by `formenctype` or the form's [`enctype`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#enctype) attribute. This URL is then sent to the server using an HTTP {{HTTPMethod("get")}} request. This method works well for forms that contain only {{Glossary("ASCII")}} characters and have no side effects. This is the default value.
- `post`
  - : The form's data is included in the body of the request that is sent to the URL given by the `formaction` or [`action`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#action) attribute using an HTTP {{HTTPMethod("post")}} method. This method supports complex data and file attachments.
- `dialog`
  - : This method is used to indicate that the button closes the dialog with which the input is associated, and does not transmit the form data at all.

This attribute is also available on [`<input type="image">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/image) and {{HTMLElement("button")}} elements.

### formnovalidate

A Boolean attribute which, if present, specifies that the form should not be validated before submission to the server. This overrides the value of the [`novalidate`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#novalidate) attribute on the element's owning form.

This attribute is also available on [`<input type="image">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/image) and {{HTMLElement("button")}} elements.

### formtarget

A string which specifies a name or keyword that indicates where to display the response received after submitting the form. The string must be the name of a **browsing context** (that is, a tab, window, or {{HTMLElement("iframe")}}). A value specified here overrides any target given by the [`target`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#target) attribute on the {{HTMLElement("form")}} that owns this input.

In addition to the actual names of tabs, windows, or inline frames, there are a few special keywords that can be used:

- `_self`
  - : Loads the response into the same browsing context as the one that contains the form. This will replace the current document with the received data. This is the default value used if none is specified.
- `_blank`
  - : Loads the response into a new, unnamed, browsing context. This is typically a new tab in the same window as the current document, but may differ depending on the configuration of the {{Glossary("user agent")}}.
- `_parent`
  - : Loads the response into the parent browsing context of the current one. If there is no parent context, this behaves the same as `_self`.
- `_top`
  - : Loads the response into the top-level browsing context; this is the browsing context that is the topmost ancestor of the current context. If the current context is the topmost context, this behaves the same as `_self`.

This attribute is also available on [`<input type="image">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/image) and {{HTMLElement("button")}} elements.

## Using submit buttons

`<input type="submit">` buttons are used to submit forms. If you want to create a custom button and then customize the behavior using JavaScript, you need to use [`<input type="button">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/button), or better still, a {{htmlelement("button")}} element.

If you choose to use `<button>` elements to create the buttons in your form, keep this in mind: If the `<button>` is inside a {{HTMLElement("form")}}, that button will be treated as the "submit" button. So you should be in the habit of expressly specifying which button is the submit button.

### A basic submit button

We'll begin by creating a form with a basic submit button:

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <label for="example">Let's submit some text</label>
    <input id="example" type="text" name="text" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <input type="submit" value="Send" />
  </div>
</form>
```

This renders like so:

{{EmbedLiveSample("A_basic_submit_button", 650, 100)}}

Try entering some text into the text field, and then submitting the form.

Upon submitting, the data name/value pair gets sent to the server. In this instance, the string will be `text=user-text`, where "user-text" is the text entered by the user, encoded to preserve special characters. Where and how the data is submitted depends on the configuration of the `<form>`; see [Sending form data](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data) for more details.

### Adding a keyboard shortcut to a submit button

Keyboard shortcuts, also known as access keys and keyboard equivalents, let the user trigger a button using a key or combination of keys on the keyboard. To add a keyboard shortcut to a submit button — just as you would with any {{HTMLElement("input")}} for which it makes sense — you use the [`accesskey`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/accesskey) global attribute.

In this example, <kbd>s</kbd> is specified as the access key (you'll need to press <kbd>s</kbd> plus the particular modifier keys for your browser/OS combination). In order to avoid conflicts with the user agent's own keyboard shortcuts, different modifier keys are used for access keys than for other shortcuts on the host computer. See [`accesskey`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/accesskey) for further details.

Here's the previous example with the <kbd>s</kbd> access key added:

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <label for="example">Let's submit some text</label>
    <input id="example" type="text" name="text" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <input type="submit" value="Send" accesskey="s" />
  </div>
</form>
```

For example, in Firefox for Mac, pressing <kbd>Control</kbd>-<kbd>Option</kbd>-<kbd>S</kbd> triggers the Send button, while Chrome on Windows uses <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>.

{{EmbedLiveSample("Adding_a_keyboard_shortcut_to_a_submit_button", 650, 100)}}

The problem with the above example is that the user will not know what the access key is! This is especially true since the modifiers are typically non-standard to avoid conflicts. When building a site, be sure to provide this information in a way that doesn't interfere with the site design (for example by providing an easily accessible link that points to information on what the site access keys are). Adding a tooltip to the button (using the [`title`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/title) attribute) can also help, although it's not a complete solution for accessibility purposes.

### Disabling and enabling a submit button

To disable a submit button, specify the [`disabled`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/disabled) attribute on it, like so:

```html
<input type="submit" value="Send" disabled />
```

You can enable and disable buttons at run time by setting `disabled` to `true` or `false`; in JavaScript this looks like `btn.disabled = true` or `btn.disabled = false`.

> [!NOTE]
> See the [`<input type="button">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/button#disabling_and_enabling_a_button) page for more ideas about enabling and disabling buttons.

## Validation

Submit buttons don't participate in constraint validation; they have no real value to be constrained.

## Examples

We've included basic examples above. There isn't really anything more to say about submit buttons. There's a reason this kind of control is sometimes called a "simple button."

# <input type="tel">

{{HTMLElement("input")}} elements of type **`tel`** are used to let the user enter and edit a telephone number. Unlike [`<input type="email">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/email) and [`<input type="url">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/url), the input value is not automatically validated to a particular format before the form can be submitted, because formats for telephone numbers vary so much around the world.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;input type=&quot;tel&quot;&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<label for="phone">
  Enter your phone number:<br />
  <small>Format: 123-456-7890</small>
</label>

<input
  type="tel"
  id="phone"
  name="phone"
  pattern="[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}"
  required />
```

```css interactive-example
label {
  display: block;
  font:
    1rem "Fira Sans",
    sans-serif;
}

input,
label {
  margin: 0.4rem 0;
}
```

Despite the fact that inputs of type `tel` are functionally identical to standard `text` inputs, they do serve useful purposes; the most quickly apparent of these is that mobile browsers — especially on mobile phones — may opt to present a custom keypad optimized for entering phone numbers. Using a specific input type for telephone numbers also makes adding custom validation and handling of phone numbers more convenient.

> [!NOTE]
> Browsers that don't support type `tel` fall back to being a standard {{HTMLElement("input/text", "text")}} input.

## Value

The {{HTMLElement("input")}} element's [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) attribute contains a string that either represents a telephone number or is an empty string (`""`).

## Additional attributes

In addition to the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes) and the attributes that operate on all {{HTMLElement("input")}} elements regardless of their type, telephone number inputs support the following attributes.

### list

The values of the list attribute is the {{domxref("Element.id", "id")}} of a {{HTMLElement("datalist")}} element located in the same document. The {{HTMLElement("datalist")}} provides a list of predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in the list that are not compatible with the [`type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#type) are not included in the suggested options. The values provided are suggestions, not requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a different value.

### maxlength

The maximum string length (measured in {{glossary("UTF-16", "UTF-16 code units")}}) that the user can enter into the telephone number field. This must be an integer value of 0 or higher. If no `maxlength` is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the telephone number field has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of `minlength`.

The input will fail [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation) if the length of the text entered into the field is greater than `maxlength` {{glossary("UTF-16", "UTF-16 code units")}} long. Constraint validation is only applied when the value is changed by the user.

### minlength

The minimum string length (measured in {{glossary("UTF-16", "UTF-16 code units")}}) that the user can enter into the telephone number field. This must be a non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by `maxlength`. If no `minlength` is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the telephone number input has no minimum length.

The telephone number field will fail [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation) if the length of the text entered into the field is fewer than `minlength` {{glossary("UTF-16", "UTF-16 code units")}} long. Constraint validation is only applied when the value is changed by the user.

### pattern

The `pattern` attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input's [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) must match for the value to pass [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation). It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the {{jsxref("RegExp")}} type, and as documented in our [guide on regular expressions](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions); the `'u'` flag is specified when compiling the regular expression so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as {{Glossary("ASCII")}}. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text.

If the specified pattern is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely.

> [!NOTE]
> Use the [`title`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#title) attribute to specify text that most browsers will display as a tooltip to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern. You should also include other explanatory text nearby.

See [Pattern validation](#pattern_validation) below for details and an example.

### placeholder

The `placeholder` attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of data, rather than an explanatory message. The text _must not_ include carriage returns or line feeds.

If the control's content has one directionality ({{Glossary("LTR")}} or {{Glossary("RTL")}}) but needs to present the placeholder in the opposite directionality, you can use Unicode bidirectional algorithm formatting characters to override directionality within the placeholder; see [How to use Unicode controls for bidi text](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-unicode-controls) for more information.

> [!NOTE]
> Avoid using the `placeholder` attribute if you can. It is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See [`<input>` labels](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#labels) for more information.

### readonly

A Boolean attribute which, if present, means this field cannot be edited by the user. Its `value` can, however, still be changed by JavaScript code directly setting the {{domxref("HTMLInputElement")}} `value` property.

> [!NOTE]
> Because a read-only field cannot have a value, `required` does not have any effect on inputs with the `readonly` attribute also specified.

### size

The `size` attribute is a numeric value indicating how many characters wide the input field should be. The value must be a number greater than zero, and the default value is 20. Since character widths vary, this may or may not be exact and should not be relied upon to be so; the resulting input may be narrower or wider than the specified number of characters, depending on the characters and the font ({{cssxref("font")}} settings in use).

This does _not_ set a limit on how many characters the user can enter into the field. It only specifies approximately how many can be seen at a time. To set an upper limit on the length of the input data, use the [`maxlength`](#maxlength) attribute.

## Using tel inputs

Telephone numbers are a very commonly collected type of data on the web. When creating any kind of registration or e-commerce site, for example, you will likely need to ask the user for a telephone number, whether for business purposes or for emergency contact purposes. Given how commonly-entered phone numbers are, it's unfortunate that a "one size fits all" solution for validating phone numbers is not practical.

Fortunately, you can consider the requirements of your own site and implement an appropriate level of validation yourself. See [Validation](#validation), below, for details.

### Custom keyboards

One of the main advantages of `<input type="tel">` is that it causes mobile browsers to display a special keyboard for entering phone numbers. For example, here's what the keypads look like on a couple of devices.

| Firefox for Android                                    | WebKit iOS (Safari/Chrome/Firefox)                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ![Firefox for Android screen shot](fx-android-tel.png) | ![Firefox for iOS screenshot](iphone-tel-keyboard-50pct.png) |

### A basic tel input

In its most basic form, a tel input can be implemented like this:

```html
<label for="telNo">Phone number:</label>
<input id="telNo" name="telNo" type="tel" />
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('A_basic_tel_input', 600, 40) }}

There is nothing magical going on here. When submitted to the server, the above input's data would be represented as, for example, `telNo=+12125553151`.

### Placeholders

Sometimes it's helpful to offer an in-context hint as to what form the input data should take. This can be especially important if the page design doesn't offer descriptive labels for each {{HTMLElement("input")}}. This is where **placeholders** come in. A placeholder is a value that demonstrates the form the `value` should take by presenting an example of a valid value, which is displayed inside the edit box when the element's `value` is `""`. Once data is entered into the box, the placeholder disappears; if the box is emptied, the placeholder reappears.

Here, we have an `tel` input with the placeholder `123-4567-8901`. Note how the placeholder disappears and reappears as you manipulate the contents of the edit field.

```html
<input id="telNo" name="telNo" type="tel" placeholder="123-4567-8901" />
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Placeholders', 600, 40) }}

### Controlling the input size

You can control not only the physical length of the input box, but also the minimum and maximum lengths allowed for the input text itself.

#### Physical input element size

The physical size of the input box can be controlled using the [`size`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#size) attribute. With it, you can specify the number of characters the input box can display at a time. In this example, for instance, the `tel` edit box is 20 characters wide:

```html
<input id="telNo" name="telNo" type="tel" size="20" />
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Physical_input_element_size', 600, 40) }}

#### Element value length

The `size` is separate from the length limitation on the entered telephone number. You can specify a minimum length, in characters, for the entered telephone number using the [`minlength`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#minlength) attribute; similarly, use [`maxlength`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#maxlength) to set the maximum length of the entered telephone number.

The example below creates a 20-character wide telephone number entry box, requiring that the contents be no shorter than 9 characters and no longer than 14 characters.

```html
<input
  id="telNo"
  name="telNo"
  type="tel"
  size="20"
  minlength="9"
  maxlength="14" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Element_value_length", 600, 40) }}

> [!NOTE]
> The above attributes do affect [Validation](#validation) — the above example's inputs will count as invalid if the length of the value is less than 9 characters, or more than 14. Most browser won't even let you enter a value over the max length.

### Providing default options

#### Providing a single default using the value attribute

As always, you can provide a default value for an `tel` input box by setting its [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) attribute:

```html
<input id="telNo" name="telNo" type="tel" value="333-4444-4444" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Providing_a_single_default_using_the_value_attribute", 600, 40)}}

#### Offering suggested values

Taking it a step further, you can provide a list of default phone number values from which the user can select. To do this, use the [`list`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#list) attribute. This doesn't limit the user to those options, but does allow them to select commonly-used telephone numbers more quickly. This also offers hints to [`autocomplete`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#autocomplete). The `list` attribute specifies the ID of a {{HTMLElement("datalist")}} element, which in turn contains one {{HTMLElement("option")}} element per suggested value; each `option`'s `value` is the corresponding suggested value for the telephone number entry box.

```html
<label for="telNo">Phone number: </label>
<input id="telNo" name="telNo" type="tel" list="defaultTels" />

<datalist id="defaultTels">
  <option value="111-1111-1111"></option>
  <option value="122-2222-2222"></option>
  <option value="333-3333-3333"></option>
  <option value="344-4444-4444"></option>
</datalist>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Offering_suggested_values", 600, 40)}}

With the {{HTMLElement("datalist")}} element and its {{HTMLElement("option")}}s in place, the browser will offer the specified values as potential values for the phone number; this is typically presented as a popup or drop-down menu containing the suggestions. While the specific user experience may vary from one browser to another, typically clicking in the edit box presents a drop-down of the suggested phone numbers. Then, as the user types, the list is adjusted to show only filtered matching values. Each typed character narrows down the list until the user makes a selection or types a custom value.

Here's a screenshot of what that might look like:

![An input box has focus with a blue focus ring. The input has a drop-down menu showing four phone numbers the user can select.](phone-number-with-options.png)

## Validation

As we've touched on before, it's quite difficult to provide a one-size-fits-all client-side validation solution for phone numbers. So what can we do? Let's consider some options.

> [!WARNING]
> HTML form validation is _not_ a substitute for server-side scripts that ensure the entered data is in the proper format before it is allowed into the database. It's far too easy for someone to make adjustments to the HTML that allow them to bypass the validation, or to remove it entirely. It's also possible for someone to bypass your HTML entirely and submit the data directly to your server. If your server-side code fails to validate the data it receives, disaster could strike when improperly-formatted data (or data which is too large, is of the wrong type, and so forth) is entered into your database.

### Making telephone numbers required

You can make it so that an empty input is invalid and won't be submitted to the server using the [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#required) attribute. For example, let's use this HTML:

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <label for="telNo">Enter a telephone number (required): </label>
    <input id="telNo" name="telNo" type="tel" required />
    <span class="validity"></span>
  </div>
  <div>
    <button>Submit</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

And let's include the following CSS to highlight valid entries with a checkmark and invalid entries with a cross:

```css
div {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  position: relative;
}

input[type="number"] {
  width: 100px;
}

input + span {
  padding-right: 30px;
}

input:invalid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✖";
  padding-left: 5px;
  color: darkred;
}

input:valid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✓";
  padding-left: 5px;
  color: #009000;
}
```

The output looks like this:

{{EmbedLiveSample("Making_telephone_numbers_required", 700, 70)}}

### Pattern validation

If you want to further restrict entered numbers so they also have to conform to a specific pattern, you can use the [`pattern`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#pattern) attribute, which takes as its value a {{Glossary("regular expression")}} that entered values have to match.

In this example we'll use the same CSS as before, but our HTML is changed to look like this:

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <label for="telNo">
      Enter a telephone number (in the form xxx-xxx-xxxx):
    </label>
    <input
      id="telNo"
      name="telNo"
      type="tel"
      required
      pattern="[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}" />
    <span class="validity"></span>
  </div>
  <div>
    <button>Submit</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

```css hidden
div {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  position: relative;
}

input[type="number"] {
  width: 100px;
}

input + span {
  padding-right: 30px;
}

input:invalid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✖";
  padding-left: 5px;
  color: darkred;
}

input:valid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✓";
  padding-left: 5px;
  color: #009000;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Pattern_validation", 700, 70)}}

Notice how the entered value is reported as invalid unless the pattern xxx-xxx-xxxx is matched; for instance, 41-323-421 won't be accepted. Neither will 800-MDN-ROCKS. However, 865-555-6502 will be accepted. This particular pattern is obviously only useful for certain locales — in a real application you'd probably have to vary the pattern used depending on the locale of the user.

## Examples

In this example, we present a {{htmlelement("select")}} element that lets the user choose which country they're in, and a set of `<input type="tel">` elements to let them enter each part of their phone number; there is no reason why you can't have multiple `tel` inputs.

Each input has a [`placeholder`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#placeholder) attribute to show a hint to sighted users about what to enter into it, a [`pattern`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#pattern) to enforce a specific number of characters for the desired section, and an [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) attribute to contain a hint to be read out to screen reader users about what to enter into it.

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <label for="country">Choose your country:</label>
    <select id="country" name="country">
      <option>UK</option>
      <option selected>US</option>
      <option>Germany</option>
    </select>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Enter your telephone number:</p>
    <span class="areaDiv">
      <input
        id="areaNo"
        name="areaNo"
        type="tel"
        required
        placeholder="Area code"
        pattern="[0-9]{3}"
        aria-label="Area code" />
      <span class="validity"></span>
    </span>
    <span class="number1Div">
      <input
        id="number1"
        name="number1"
        type="tel"
        required
        placeholder="First part"
        pattern="[0-9]{3}"
        aria-label="First part of number" />
      <span class="validity"></span>
    </span>
    <span class="number2Div">
      <input
        id="number2"
        name="number2"
        type="tel"
        required
        placeholder="Second part"
        pattern="[0-9]{4}"
        aria-label="Second part of number" />
      <span class="validity"></span>
    </span>
  </div>
  <div>
    <button>Submit</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

The JavaScript contains an {{domxref("HTMLElement.change_event", "onchange")}} event handler that, when the `<select>` value is changed, updates the `<input>` element's `pattern`, `placeholder`, and `aria-label` to suit the format of telephone numbers in that country/territory.

```js
const selectElem = document.querySelector("select");
const inputElems = document.querySelectorAll("input");

selectElem.onchange = () => {
  for (const e of inputElems) {
    e.value = "";
  }

  if (selectElem.value === "US") {
    inputElems[2].parentNode.style.display = "inline";

    inputElems[0].placeholder = "Area code";
    inputElems[0].pattern = "[0-9]{3}";

    inputElems[1].placeholder = "First part";
    inputElems[1].pattern = "[0-9]{3}";
    inputElems[1].setAttribute("aria-label", "First part of number");

    inputElems[2].placeholder = "Second part";
    inputElems[2].pattern = "[0-9]{4}";
    inputElems[2].setAttribute("aria-label", "Second part of number");
  } else if (selectElem.value === "UK") {
    inputElems[2].parentNode.style.display = "none";

    inputElems[0].placeholder = "Area code";
    inputElems[0].pattern = "[0-9]{3,6}";

    inputElems[1].placeholder = "Local number";
    inputElems[1].pattern = "[0-9]{4,8}";
    inputElems[1].setAttribute("aria-label", "Local number");
  } else if (selectElem.value === "Germany") {
    inputElems[2].parentNode.style.display = "inline";

    inputElems[0].placeholder = "Area code";
    inputElems[0].pattern = "[0-9]{3,5}";

    inputElems[1].placeholder = "First part";
    inputElems[1].pattern = "[0-9]{2,4}";
    inputElems[1].setAttribute("aria-label", "First part of number");

    inputElems[2].placeholder = "Second part";
    inputElems[2].pattern = "[0-9]{4}";
    inputElems[2].setAttribute("aria-label", "Second part of number");
  }
};
```

The example looks like this:

{{EmbedLiveSample('Examples', 600, 140)}}

This is an interesting idea, which goes to show a potential solution to the problem of dealing with international phone numbers. You would have to extend the example of course to provide the correct pattern for potentially every country, which would be a lot of work, and there would still be no foolproof guarantee that the users would enter their numbers correctly.

It makes you wonder if it is worth going to all this trouble on the client-side, when you could just let the user enter their number in whatever format they wanted on the client-side and then validate and sanitize it on the server. But this choice is yours to make.

```css hidden
div {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  position: relative;
}

input[type="number"] {
  width: 100px;
}

input + span {
  padding-right: 30px;
}

input:invalid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✖";
  padding-left: 5px;
  color: darkred;
}

input:valid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✓";
  padding-left: 5px;
  color: #009000;
}
```

# <input type="text">

{{HTMLElement("input")}} elements of type **`text`** create basic single-line text fields.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot;&gt;", "tabbed-shorter")}}

```html interactive-example
<label for="name">Name (4 to 8 characters):</label>

<input
  type="text"
  id="name"
  name="name"
  required
  minlength="4"
  maxlength="8"
  size="10" />
```

```css interactive-example
label {
  display: block;
  font:
    1rem "Fira Sans",
    sans-serif;
}

input,
label {
  margin: 0.4rem 0;
}
```

## Value

The [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) attribute is a string that contains the current value of the text entered into the text field. You can retrieve this using the {{domxref("HTMLInputElement")}} `value` property in JavaScript.

```js
let theText = myTextInput.value;
```

If no validation constraints are in place for the input (see [Validation](#validation) for more details), the value may be an empty string (`""`).

## Additional attributes

In addition to the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes) and the attributes that operate on all {{HTMLElement("input")}} elements regardless of their type, text inputs support the following attributes.

### `list`

The values of the list attribute is the {{domxref("Element.id", "id")}} of a {{HTMLElement("datalist")}} element located in the same document. The {{HTMLElement("datalist")}} provides a list of predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in the list that are not compatible with the [`type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#type) are not included in the suggested options. The values provided are suggestions, not requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a different value.

### `maxlength`

The maximum string length (measured in {{glossary("UTF-16", "UTF-16 code units")}}) that the user can enter into the `text` input. This must be an integer value of 0 or higher. If no `maxlength` is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the `text` input has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of `minlength`.

The input will fail [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation) if the length of the text value of the field is greater than `maxlength` {{glossary("UTF-16", "UTF-16 code units")}} long. Constraint validation is only applied when the value is changed by the user.

### `minlength`

The minimum string length (measured in {{glossary("UTF-16", "UTF-16 code units")}}) that the user can enter into the `text` input. This must be a non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by `maxlength`. If no `minlength` is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the `text` input has no minimum length.

The input will fail [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation) if the length of the text entered into the field is fewer than `minlength` {{glossary("UTF-16", "UTF-16 code units")}} long. Constraint validation is only applied when the value is changed by the user.

### `pattern`

The `pattern` attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input's [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) must match for the value to pass [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation). It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the {{jsxref("RegExp")}} type, and as documented in our [guide on regular expressions](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions); the `'u'` flag is specified when compiling the regular expression so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as {{Glossary("ASCII")}}. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text.

If the specified pattern is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely.

> [!NOTE]
> Use the [`title`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#title) attribute to specify text that most browsers will display as a tooltip to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern. You should also include other explanatory text nearby.

See [Specifying a pattern](#specifying_a_pattern) for further details and an example.

### `placeholder`

The `placeholder` attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of data, rather than an explanatory message. The text _must not_ include carriage returns or line feeds.

If the control's content has one directionality ({{Glossary("LTR")}} or {{Glossary("RTL")}}) but needs to present the placeholder in the opposite directionality, you can use Unicode bidirectional algorithm formatting characters to override directionality within the placeholder; see [How to use Unicode controls for bidi text](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-unicode-controls) for more information.

> [!NOTE]
> Avoid using the `placeholder` attribute if you can. It is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See [`<input>` accessibility concerns](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#accessibility) for more information.

### `readonly`

A Boolean attribute which, if present, means this field cannot be edited by the user. Its `value` can, however, still be changed by JavaScript code directly setting the {{domxref("HTMLInputElement")}} `value` property.

> [!NOTE]
> Because a read-only field cannot have a value, `required` does not have any effect on inputs with the `readonly` attribute also specified.

### `size`

The `size` attribute is a numeric value indicating how many characters wide the input field should be. The value must be a number greater than zero, and the default value is 20. Since character widths vary, this may or may not be exact and should not be relied upon to be so; the resulting input may be narrower or wider than the specified number of characters, depending on the characters and the font ({{cssxref("font")}} settings in use).

This does _not_ set a limit on how many characters the user can enter into the field. It only specifies approximately how many can be seen at a time. To set an upper limit on the length of the input data, use the [`maxlength`](#maxlength) attribute.

### `spellcheck`

The [`spellcheck`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/spellcheck) global attribute is used to indicate whether to enable spell-checking for an element. It can be used on any editable content, but here we consider specifics related to the use of `spellcheck` on {{HTMLElement("input")}} elements. The permitted values for `spellcheck` are:

- `false`
  - : Disable spell-checking for this element.
- `true`
  - : Enable spell-checking for this element.
- `""` (empty string) or no value
  - : Follow the element's default behavior for spell-checking. This may be based upon a parent's `spellcheck` setting or other factors.

An input field can have spell-checking enabled if it doesn't have the [readonly](#readonly) attribute set and is not disabled.

The value returned by reading `spellcheck` may not reflect the actual state of spell-checking within a control, if the {{Glossary("user agent", "user agent's")}} preferences override the setting.

## Using text inputs

`<input>` elements of type `text` create basic, single-line inputs. You should use them anywhere you want the user to enter a single-line value and there isn't a more specific input type available for collecting that value (for example, if it's a [date](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/datetime-local), [URL](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/url), [email](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/email), or [search term](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/search), you've got better options available).

### Basic example

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <label for="uname">Choose a username: </label>
    <input type="text" id="uname" name="name" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <button>Submit</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

This renders like so:

{{EmbedLiveSample("Basic_example", 600, 80)}}

When submitted, the data name/value pair sent to the server will be `name=Chris` (if "Chris" was entered as the input value before submission). You must remember to include [`name`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#name) attribute on the {{HTMLElement("input")}} element, otherwise the text field's value won't be included with the submitted data.

### Setting placeholders

You can provide a useful placeholder inside your text input that can provide a hint as to what to enter by including using the [`placeholder`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#placeholder) attribute. Look at the following example:

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <label for="uname">Choose a username: </label>
    <input
      type="text"
      id="uname"
      name="name"
      placeholder="Lower case, all one word" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <button>Submit</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

You can see how the placeholder is rendered below:

{{EmbedLiveSample("Setting_placeholders", 600, 80)}}

The placeholder is typically rendered in a lighter color than the element's foreground color, and automatically vanishes when the user begins to enter text into the field (or whenever the field has a value set programmatically by setting its `value` attribute).

### Physical input element size

The physical size of the input box can be controlled using the [`size`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#size) attribute. With it, you can specify the number of characters the text input can display at a time. This affects the width of the element, letting you specify the width in terms of characters rather than pixels. In this example, for instance, the input is 30 characters wide:

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <label for="uname">Choose a username: </label>
    <input
      type="text"
      id="uname"
      name="name"
      placeholder="Lower case, all one word"
      size="30" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <button>Submit</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Physical_input_element_size', 600, 80)}}

## Validation

`<input>` elements of type `text` have no automatic validation applied to them (since a basic text input needs to be capable of accepting any arbitrary string), but there are some client-side validation options available, which we'll discuss below.

> [!NOTE]
> HTML form validation is _not_ a substitute for server-scripts that ensure the entered data is in the proper format. It's far too easy for someone to make adjustments to the HTML that allow them to bypass the validation, or to remove it entirely. It's also possible for someone to bypass your HTML entirely and submit the data directly to your server. If your server-side code fails to validate the data it receives, disaster could strike when improperly-formatted data (or data which is too large, is of the wrong type, and so forth) is entered into your database.

### A note on styling

There are useful pseudo-classes available for styling form elements to help the user see when their values are valid or invalid. These are {{cssxref(":valid")}} and {{cssxref(":invalid")}}. In this section, we'll use the following CSS, which will place a check (tick) mark next to inputs containing valid values, and a cross (X) next to inputs containing invalid values.

```css
div {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  position: relative;
}

input + span {
  padding-right: 30px;
}

input:invalid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✖";
  padding-left: 5px;
}

input:valid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✓";
  padding-left: 5px;
}
```

The technique also requires a {{htmlelement("span")}} element to be placed after the form element, which acts as a holder for the icons. This was necessary because some input types on some browsers don't display icons placed directly after them very well.

### Making input required

You can use the [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#required) attribute as an easy way of making entering a value required before form submission is allowed:

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <label for="uname">Choose a username: </label>
    <input type="text" id="uname" name="name" required />
    <span class="validity"></span>
  </div>
  <div>
    <button>Submit</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

```css hidden
div {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  position: relative;
}
input + span {
  padding-right: 30px;
}
input:invalid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✖";
  padding-left: 5px;
}
input:valid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✓";
  padding-left: 5px;
}
```

This renders like so:

{{EmbedLiveSample('Making_input_required', 600, 100)}}

If you try to submit the form with no username entered into it, the browser will show an error message.

### Input value length

You can specify a minimum length (in characters) for the entered value using the [`minlength`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#minlength) attribute; similarly, use [`maxlength`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#maxlength) to set the maximum length of the entered value, in characters.

The example below requires that the entered value be 4–8 characters in length.

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <label for="uname">Choose a username: </label>
    <input
      type="text"
      id="uname"
      name="name"
      required
      size="10"
      placeholder="Username"
      minlength="4"
      maxlength="8" />
    <span class="validity"></span>
  </div>
  <div>
    <button>Submit</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

```css hidden
div {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  position: relative;
}
input + span {
  padding-right: 30px;
}
input:invalid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✖";
  padding-left: 5px;
}
input:valid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✓";
  padding-left: 5px;
}
```

This renders like so:

{{EmbedLiveSample('Input_value_length', 600, 100)}}

If you try to submit the form with less than 4 characters, you'll be given an appropriate error message (which differs between browsers). If you try to enter more than 8 characters, the browser won't let you.

> [!NOTE]
> If you specify a `minlength` but do not specify `required`, the input is considered valid, since the user is not required to specify a value.

### Specifying a pattern

You can use the [`pattern`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#pattern) attribute to specify a regular expression that the inputted value must match in order to be considered valid (see [Validating against a regular expression](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Form_validation#validating_against_a_regular_expression) for a crash course on using regular expressions to validate inputs).

The example below restricts the value to 4-8 characters and requires that it contain only lower-case letters.

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <label for="uname">Choose a username: </label>
    <input
      type="text"
      id="uname"
      name="name"
      required
      size="45"
      pattern="[a-z]{4,8}" />
    <span class="validity"></span>
    <p>Usernames must be lowercase and 4-8 characters in length.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <button>Submit</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

```css hidden
div {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  position: relative;
}

p {
  font-size: 80%;
  color: #999999;
}

input + span {
  padding-right: 30px;
}

input:invalid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✖";
  padding-left: 5px;
}

input:valid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✓";
  padding-left: 5px;
}
```

This renders like so:

{{EmbedLiveSample('Specifying_a_pattern', 600, 130)}}

{{htmlelement("input")}} elements of type **`time`** create input fields designed to let the user easily enter a time (hours and minutes, and optionally seconds).

While the control's user interface appearance is based on the browser and operating system, the features are the same. The value is always a 24-hour `HH:mm` or `HH:mm:ss` formatted time, with leading zeros, regardless of the UI's input format.

<small>Office hours are 9am to 6pm</small>
```

```css interactive-example

  display: block;
  font:
    1rem "Fira Sans",
    sans-serif;
}

input,
label {
  margin: 0.4rem 0;
}
```

### Setting the value attribute

You can set a default value for the input by including a valid time in the [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) attribute when creating the `<input>` element, like so:

```html
<label for="appointment-time">Choose an appointment time: </label>
<input
  id="appointment-time"
  type="time"
  name="appointment-time"
  value="13:30" />
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Setting_the_value_attribute', 600, 60) }}

### Setting the value using JavaScript

You can also get and set the time value in JavaScript using the {{domxref("HTMLInputElement")}} `value` property, for example:

```js
const timeControl = document.querySelector('input[type="time"]');
timeControl.value = "15:30";
```

### Time value format

The `value` of the `time` input is always in 24-hour format that includes leading zeros: `HH:mm`, regardless of the input format, which is likely to be selected based on the user's locale (or by the user agent). If the time includes seconds (see [Using the step attribute](#using_the_step_attribute)), the format is always `HH:mm:ss`. You can learn more about the format of the time value used by this input type in [Time strings](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Date_and_time_formats#time_strings).

In this example, you can see the time input's value by entering a time and seeing how it changes afterward.

First, a look at the HTML. We include a label and input, and add a {{HTMLElement("p")}} element with a {{HTMLElement("span")}} to display the value of the `time` input:

```html
<form>
  <label for="startTime">Start time: </label>
  <input type="time" id="startTime" />
  <p>
    Value of the <code>time</code> input:
    <code>"<span id="value">n/a</span>"</code>.
  </p>
</form>
```

The JavaScript code adds code to the time input to watch for the {{domxref("Element/input_event", "input")}} event, which is triggered every time the contents of an input element change. When this happens, the contents of the `<span>` are replaced with the new value of the input element.

```js
const startTime = document.getElementById("startTime");
const valueSpan = document.getElementById("value");

startTime.addEventListener("input", () => {
  valueSpan.innerText = startTime.value;
});
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Time_value_format", 600, 80)}}

When a form including a `time` input is submitted, the value is encoded before being included in the form's data. The form's data entry for a time input will always be in the form `name=HH%3Amm`, or `name=HH%3Amm%3Ass` if seconds are included (see [Using the step attribute](#using_the_step_attribute)).

## Additional attributes

In addition to the attributes common to all {{HTMLElement("input")}} elements, `time` inputs offer the following attributes.

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike many data types, time values have a **periodic domain**, meaning that the values reach the highest possible value, then wrap back around to the beginning again. For example, specifying a `min` of `14:00` and a `max` of `2:00` means that the permitted time values start at 2:00 PM, run through midnight to the next day, ending at 2:00 AM. See more in the [making min and max cross midnight](#making_min_and_max_cross_midnight) section of this article.

### list

The values of the list attribute is the {{domxref("Element.id", "id")}} of a {{HTMLElement("datalist")}} element located in the same document. The {{HTMLElement("datalist")}} provides a list of predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in the list that are not compatible with the [`type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#type) are not included in the suggested options. The values provided are suggestions, not requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a different value.

### max

A string indicating the latest time to accept, specified in the same [time value format](#time_value_format) as described above. If the specified string isn't a valid time, no maximum value is set.

### min

A string specifying the earliest time to accept, given in the [time value format](#time_value_format) described previously. If the value specified isn't a valid time string, no minimum value is set.

### readonly

A Boolean attribute which, if present, means this field cannot be edited by the user. Its `value` can, however, still be changed by JavaScript code directly setting the {{domxref("HTMLInputElement")}} `value` property.

> [!NOTE]
> Because a read-only field cannot have a value, `required` does not have any effect on inputs with the `readonly` attribute also specified.

### step

The `step` attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to, or the special value `any`, which is described below. Only values which are a whole number of steps from the step base are valid. The step base is [`min`](#min) if specified, [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) otherwise, or `0` (`00:00:00`) if neither is provided.

For `time` inputs, the value of `step` is given in seconds and is treated as a number of milliseconds equal to 1000 times the `step` value (the underlying numeric value is in milliseconds). The default value is 60, indicating 1 minute.

A string value of `any` means that no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as [`min`](#min) and [`max`](#max)). In reality, it has the same effect as `60` for `time` inputs because the picker UI in this case only allows selecting whole minutes.

> [!NOTE]
> When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping configuration, the {{Glossary("user agent")}} may round to the nearest valid value, preferring numbers in the positive direction when there are two equally close options.

## Using time inputs

### Basic uses of time

The most basic use of `<input type="time">` involves a basic `<input>` and {{htmlelement("label")}} element combination, as seen below:

```html
<form>
  <label for="appointment-time">Choose an appointment time: </label>
  <input id="appointment-time" type="time" name="appointment-time" />
</form>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Basic_uses_of_time', 600, 40)}}

### Controlling input size

`<input type="time">` doesn't support form sizing attributes such as [`size`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#size), since times are always about the same number of characters long. You'll have to resort to [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) for sizing needs.

### Using the step attribute

You can use the [`step`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#step) attribute to vary the amount of time jumped whenever the time is incremented or decremented (for example, so the time moves by 10 minutes at a time when clicking the little arrow widgets).

It takes an integer value defining the number of seconds you want to increment by; the default value is 60 seconds. With this as the default, most user agent time UIs display hours and minutes but not seconds. Including the [`step`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#step) attribute with any numeric value other than a value divisible by `60` adds seconds to the UI, if the `min` or `max` value has not already caused the seconds to be visible.

```html
<form>
  <label for="appointment-time">Choose an appointment time: </label>
  <input id="appointment-time" type="time" name="appointment-time" step="2" />
</form>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Using_the_step_attribute', 600, 40)}}

To specify minutes or hours as a step, specify the number of minutes or hours in seconds, such as 120 for 2 minutes, or 7200 for 2 hours.

## Validation

By default, `<input type="time">` does not apply any validation to entered values, other than the user agent's interface generally not allowing you to enter anything other than a time value. This is helpful, but you can't entirely rely on the value to be a proper time string, since it might be an empty string (`""`), which is allowed.

### Setting maximum and minimum times

You can use the [`min`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#min) and [`max`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#max) attributes to restrict the valid times that can be chosen by the user. In the following example we are setting a minimum time of `12:00` and a maximum time of `18:00`:

```html
<form>
  <label for="appointment-time">
    Choose an appointment time (opening hours 12:00 to 18:00):
  </label>
  <input
    id="appointment-time"
    type="time"
    name="appointment-time"
    min="12:00"
    max="18:00" />
  <span class="validity"></span>
</form>
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Setting_maximum_and_minimum_times', 600, 40) }}

Here's the CSS used in the above example. Here we make use of the {{cssxref(":valid")}} and {{cssxref(":invalid")}} CSS properties to style the input based on whether the current value is valid. We add an icon as generated content icon on a {{htmlelement("span")}} next to the input.

```css
div {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  position: relative;
}

input[type="number"] {
  width: 100px;
}

input + span {
  padding-right: 30px;
}

input:invalid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✖";
  padding-left: 5px;
}

input:valid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✓";
  padding-left: 5px;
}
```

The result here is that:

- Only times between 12:00 and 18:00 will be seen as valid; times outside that range will be denoted as invalid.

#### Making min and max cross midnight

By setting a [`min`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#min) attribute greater than the [`max`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#max) attribute, the valid time range will wrap around midnight to produce a valid time range. This functionality is not supported by any other input types.

```js
const input = document.createElement("input");
input.type = "time";
input.min = "23:00";
input.max = "01:00";
input.value = "23:59";

if (input.validity.valid && input.type === "time") {
  // <input type=time> reversed range supported
} else {
  // <input type=time> reversed range unsupported
}
```

### Making times required

In addition, you can use the [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#required) attribute to make filling in the time mandatory. Browsers will display an error if you try to submit a time that is outside the set bounds, or an empty time field.

Let's look at an example; here we've set minimum and maximum times, and also made the field required:

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <label for="appointment-time">
      Choose an appointment time (opening hours 12:00 to 18:00):
    </label>
    <input
      id="appointment-time"
      type="time"
      name="appointment-time"
      min="12:00"
      max="18:00"
      required />
    <span class="validity"></span>
  </div>
  <div>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit form" />
  </div>
</form>
```

If you try to submit the form with an incomplete time (or with a time outside the set bounds), the browser displays an error. Try playing with the example now:

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Making_times_required', 600, 120) }}

> [!WARNING]
> HTML form validation is _not_ a substitute for scripts that ensure that the entered data is in the proper format. It's far too easy for someone to make adjustments to the HTML that allow them to bypass the validation, or to remove it entirely. It's also possible for someone to bypass your HTML entirely and submit the data directly to your server. If your server-side code fails to validate the data it receives, disaster could strike when improperly-formatted data is submitted (or data which is too large, of the wrong type, and so forth).

## Examples

In this example, we create an interface element for choosing time using the native picker created with `<input type="time">`:

### HTML

```html
<form>
  <label for="appointment-time">
    Choose an appointment time (opening hours 12:00 to 18:00):
  </label>
  <input
    id="appointment-time"
    type="time"
    name="appointment-time"
    min="12:00"
    max="18:00"
    required />
  <span class="validity"></span>
</form>
```

### CSS

```css
input[type="time"] {
  width: 100px;
}

input + span {
  padding-right: 30px;
}

input:invalid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✖";
  padding-left: 5px;
}

input:valid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✓";
  padding-left: 5px;
}
```

# <input type="url">

{{HTMLElement("input")}} elements of type **`url`** are used to let the user enter and edit a URL.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;input type=&quot;url&quot;&gt;", "tabbed-shorter")}}

```html interactive-example
<form>
  <label for="url">Enter an https:// URL:</label>
  <input
    type="url"
    name="url"
    id="url"
    placeholder="https://example.com"
    pattern="https://.*"
    size="30"
    required />
</form>
```

```css interactive-example
label {
  display: block;
  font:
    1rem "Fira Sans",
    sans-serif;
}

input,
label {
  margin: 0.4rem 0;
}
```

The input value is automatically validated to ensure that it's either empty or a properly-formatted URL before the form can be submitted. The {{cssxref(":valid")}} and {{cssxref(":invalid")}} CSS pseudo-classes are automatically applied as appropriate to visually denote whether the current value of the field is a valid URL or not.

## Value

The {{HTMLElement("input")}} element's [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) attribute contains a string that is automatically validated as conforming to URL syntax. More specifically, there are two possible value formats that will pass validation:

1. An empty string ("") indicates the user did not enter a value or that the value was removed.
2. A single properly-formed absolute URL. This doesn't necessarily mean the URL address exists, but it is at least formatted correctly. An entry matching `urlscheme://rest-of-url` can be valid, even if the `urlscheme` entered doesn't exist.

See [Validation](#validation) for details on how URLs are validated to ensure that they're formatted properly.

## Additional attributes

In addition to the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes), and the attributes that operate on all {{HTMLElement("input")}} elements regardless of their type, `url` inputs support the following attributes.

> [!NOTE]
> The [`autocorrect`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/autocorrect) global attribute can be added to url inputs, but the stored state is always `off`.

### list

The values of the list attribute is the {{domxref("Element.id", "id")}} of a {{HTMLElement("datalist")}} element located in the same document. The {{HTMLElement("datalist")}} provides a list of predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in the list that are not compatible with the [`type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#type) are not included in the suggested options. The values provided are suggestions, not requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a different value.

### maxlength

The maximum string length (measured in {{glossary("UTF-16", "UTF-16 code units")}}) that the user can enter into the `url` input. This must be an integer value of `0` or higher. If no `maxlength` is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the `url` input has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of `minlength`.

The input will fail [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation) if the length of the text value of the field is greater than `maxlength` {{glossary("UTF-16", "UTF-16 code units")}} long. Constraint validation is only applied when the value is changed by the user.

### minlength

The minimum string length (measured in {{glossary("UTF-16", "UTF-16 code units")}}) that the user can enter into the `url` input. This must be a non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by `maxlength`. If no `minlength` is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the `url` input has no minimum length.

The input will fail [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation) if the length of the text entered into the field is fewer than `minlength` {{glossary("UTF-16", "UTF-16 code units")}} long. Constraint validation is only applied when the value is changed by the user.

### pattern

The `pattern` attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input's [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) must match for the value to pass [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation). It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the {{jsxref("RegExp")}} type, and as documented in our [guide on regular expressions](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions); the `'u'` flag is specified when compiling the regular expression so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as {{Glossary("ASCII")}}. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text.

If the specified pattern is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely.

> [!NOTE]
> Use the [`title`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#title) attribute to specify text that most browsers will display as a tooltip to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern. You should also include other explanatory text nearby.

See the section [Pattern validation](#pattern_validation) for details and an example.

### placeholder

The `placeholder` attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of data, rather than an explanatory message. The text _must not_ include carriage returns or line feeds.

If the control's content has one directionality ({{Glossary("LTR")}} or {{Glossary("RTL")}}) but needs to present the placeholder in the opposite directionality, you can use Unicode bidirectional algorithm formatting characters to override directionality within the placeholder; see [How to use Unicode controls for bidi text](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-unicode-controls) for more information.

> [!NOTE]
> Avoid using the `placeholder` attribute if you can. It is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See [`<input>` labels](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#labels) for more information.

### readonly

The [`readonly`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/readonly) Boolean attribute, if present, means this field cannot be edited by the user. Its `value` can, however, still be changed by JavaScript code directly setting the {{domxref("HTMLInputElement")}} `value` property.

> [!NOTE]
> Because a read-only field cannot have a value, [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/required) does not have any effect on inputs with the `readonly` attribute also specified.

### size

The `size` attribute is a numeric value indicating how many characters wide the input field should be. The value must be a number greater than zero, and the default value is 20. Since character widths vary, this may or may not be exact and should not be relied upon to be so; the resulting input may be narrower or wider than the specified number of characters, depending on the characters and the font ({{cssxref("font")}} settings in use).

This does _not_ set a limit on how many characters the user can enter into the field. It only specifies approximately how many can be seen at a time. To set an upper limit on the length of the input data, use the [`maxlength`](#maxlength) attribute.

### spellcheck

The [`spellcheck`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/spellcheck) global attribute is used to indicate whether to enable spell-checking for an element. It can be used on any editable content, but here we consider specifics related to the use of `spellcheck` on {{HTMLElement("input")}} elements. The permitted values for `spellcheck` are:

- `false`
  - : Disable spell-checking for this element.
- `true`
  - : Enable spell-checking for this element.
- "" (empty string) or no value
  - : Follow the element's default behavior for spell-checking. This may be based upon a parent's `spellcheck` setting or other factors.

An input field can have spell-checking enabled if it doesn't have the [readonly](#readonly) attribute set and is not disabled.

The value returned by reading `spellcheck` may not reflect the actual state of spell-checking within a control if the {{Glossary("user agent", "user agent's")}} preferences override the setting.

## Using URL inputs

When you create a URL input with the proper `type` value, `url`, you get automatic validation that the entered text is at least in the correct form to potentially be a legitimate URL. This can help avoid cases in which the user mistypes their website's address, or provides an invalid one.

It's important, however, to note that this is not enough to ensure that the specified text is a URL which actually exists, corresponds to the user of the site, or is acceptable in any other way. It ensures that the value of the field is properly formatted to be a URL.

> [!NOTE]
> A user can tinker with your HTML behind the scenes, so your site _must not_ use this validation for any security purposes. You _must_ verify the URL on the server-side of any transaction in which the provided text may have any security implications of any kind.

### A basic URL input

This element is implemented as a standard text input field with basic validation features. In its most basic form, a URL input can be implemented like this:

```html
<input id="myURL" name="myURL" type="url" />
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('A_basic_URL_input', 600, 40) }}

Notice that it's considered valid when empty and when a single validly-formatted URL address is entered, but is otherwise not considered valid. By adding the [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#required) attribute, only properly-formed URLs are allowed; the input is no longer considered valid when empty.

There is nothing magical going on here. Submitting this form would cause the following data to be sent to the server: `myURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.com`. Note how characters are escaped as necessary.

### Placeholders

Sometimes it's helpful to offer an in-context hint as to what form the input data should take. This can be especially important if the page design doesn't offer descriptive labels for each {{HTMLElement("input")}}. This is where **placeholders** come in. A placeholder is a value that demonstrates the form the `value` should take by presenting an example of a valid value, which is displayed inside the edit box when the element's `value` is "". Once data is entered into the box, the placeholder disappears; if the box is emptied, the placeholder reappears.

Here, we have a `url` input with the placeholder `http://www.example.com`. Note how the placeholder disappears and reappears as you manipulate the contents of the edit field.

```html
<input
  id="myURL"
  name="myURL"
  type="url"
  placeholder="http://www.example.com" />
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Placeholders', 600, 40) }}

### Controlling the input size

You can control both the physical length of the input box and the minimum and maximum lengths allowed for the input text.

#### Physical input element size

The physical size of the input box can be controlled using the [`size`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#size) attribute. With it, you can specify the number of characters the input box can display at a time. In this example, for instance, the `url` edit box is 30 characters wide:

```html
<input id="myURL" name="myURL" type="url" size="30" />
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Physical_input_element_size', 600, 40) }}

#### Element value length

The `size` is separate from the length limitation on the entered URL itself. You can specify a minimum length, in characters, for the entered URL using the [`minlength`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#minlength) attribute; similarly, use [`maxlength`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#maxlength) to set the maximum length of the entered URL. If `maxLength` exceeds `size`, the input box's contents will scroll as needed to show the current selection or insertion point as the content is manipulated.

The example below creates a 30-character wide URL address entry box, requiring that the contents be no shorter than 10 characters and no longer than 80 characters.

```html
<input
  id="myURL"
  name="myURL"
  type="url"
  size="30"
  minlength="10"
  maxlength="80" />
```

> These attributes also affect validation; a value shorter or longer than the specified minimum/maximum lengths will be classified as invalid; in addition most browsers will refuse to let the user enter a value longer than the specified maximum length.

### Providing default options

#### Providing a single default using the value attribute

As always, you can provide a default value for a `url` input box by setting its [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) attribute:

```html
<input id="myURL" name="myURL" type="url" value="http://www.example.com" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Providing_a_single_default_using_the_value_attribute", 600, 40)}}

#### Offering suggested values

Taking it a step further, you can provide a list of default options from which the user can select by specifying the [`list`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#list) attribute. This doesn't limit the user to those options, but does allow them to select commonly-used URLs more quickly. This also offers hints to [`autocomplete`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#autocomplete). The `list` attribute specifies the ID of a {{HTMLElement("datalist")}}, which in turn contains one {{HTMLElement("option")}} element per suggested value; each `option`'s `value` is the corresponding suggested value for the URL entry box.

```html
<input id="myURL" name="myURL" type="url" list="defaultURLs" />

<datalist id="defaultURLs">
  <option value="https://developer.mozilla.org/"></option>
  <option value="http://www.google.com/"></option>
  <option value="http://www.microsoft.com/"></option>
  <option value="https://www.mozilla.org/"></option>
  <option value="http://w3.org/"></option>
</datalist>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Offering_suggested_values", 600, 40)}}

With the {{HTMLElement("datalist")}} element and its {{HTMLElement("option")}}s in place, the browser will offer the specified values as potential values for the URL; this is typically presented as a popup or drop-down menu containing the suggestions. While the specific user experience may vary from one browser to another, typically clicking in the edit box presents a drop-down of the suggested URLs. Then, as the user types, the list is adjusted to show only matching values. Each typed character narrows down the list until the user makes a selection or types a custom value.

#### Using labels for suggested values

You can opt to include the [`label`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/option#label) attribute on one or all of your `<option>` elements to provide textual labels. Some browsers may display only the labels, while others may display both the label and the URL.

```html
<input id="myURL" name="myURL" type="url" list="defaultURLs" />

<datalist id="defaultURLs">
  <option value="https://developer.mozilla.org/" label="MDN Web Docs"></option>
  <option value="http://www.google.com/" label="Google"></option>
  <option value="http://www.microsoft.com/" label="Microsoft"></option>
  <option value="https://www.mozilla.org/" label="Mozilla"></option>
  <option value="http://w3.org/" label="W3C"></option>
</datalist>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Using_labels_for_suggested_values", 600, 40)}}

## Validation

There are two levels of content validation available for `url` inputs. First, there's the standard level of validation offered to all {{HTMLElement("input")}}s, which automatically ensures that the contents meet the requirements to be a valid URL. But there's also the option to add additional filtering to ensure that your own specialized needs are met, if you have any.

> [!WARNING]
> HTML form validation is _not_ a substitute for scripts that ensure that the entered data is in the proper format. It's far too easy for someone to make adjustments to the HTML that allow them to bypass the validation, or to remove it entirely. It's also possible for someone to bypass your HTML entirely and submit the data directly to your server. If your server-side code fails to validate the data it receives, disaster could strike when improperly-formatted data (or data which is too large, is of the wrong type, and so forth) is entered into your database.

### Basic validation

Browsers that support the `url` input type automatically provide validation to ensure that only text that matches the standard format for URLs is entered into the input box.

The syntax of a URL is fairly intricate. It's defined by WHATWG's [URL Living Standard](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/) and is described for newcomers in our article [What is a URL?](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_URL)

### Making a URL required

As mentioned earlier, to make a URL entry required before the form can be submitted (you can't leave the field blank), you just need to include the [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#required) attribute on the input.

### Pattern validation

If you need the entered URL to be restricted further than just "any string that looks like a URL," you can use the [`pattern`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#pattern) attribute to specify a {{Glossary("regular expression")}} the value must match for the value to be valid.

## Examples

### URL validation

In this example, we make sure that a URL is filled in using the [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#required) attribute and that the URL is something on `mozilla.org` using the [`pattern`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#pattern) attribute for illustration.

#### HTML

In the `url` input, we set `pattern` to `".*\.mozilla\.org.*"`. This regular expression validates a string that has any number of characters, followed by ".mozilla.org", followed by any number of characters. Because the browser runs both the standard URL filter _and_ our custom pattern against the specified text, we wind up with a validation that says "make sure this is a valid URL, and also contains `.mozilla.org`."

Note that a strict pattern like `https://developer\.mozilla\.org.*` would be more robust, but that would make the `type="url"` attribute redundant in this case.

The [`title`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/title) attribute also describes the `pattern` for users with assistive technologies.

```html live-sample___url-validation
<form>
  <label for="myURL">
    Enter a url from this site:
    <input
      id="myURL"
      name="myURL"
      type="url"
      required
      pattern=".*\.mozilla\.org.*"
      title="URL should include mozilla.org" />
    <span class="validity"></span>
  </label>
  <button>Submit</button>
</form>
```

#### CSS

The CSS gives visual clues to show the user if the content is {{cssxref(":valid")}} or {{cssxref(":invalid")}} by adding an appropriate {{cssxref("content")}} property and includes [alternative text](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content#alternative_text_string_counter) for users with assistive technologies.

```css live-sample___url-validation
input:focus:invalid {
  outline: 2px solid red;
}

input:focus:valid {
  outline: 2px solid green;
}

input + span {
  padding: 0 0.3rem;
}

input:invalid + span::after {
  content: "✖" / "Content is not valid";
  color: red;
}

input:valid + span::after {
  content: "✓" / "Content is valid";
  color: green;
}
```

#### Result

Copy this page's url and paste it in the input field and you will see a green outline and green tick. Enter any other URL that doesn't contain **mozilla.org** or an invalid URL and you will see a red outline and red cross.

# <input type="week">

{{HTMLElement("input")}} elements of type **`week`** create input fields allowing easy entry of a year plus the [ISO 8601 week number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Week_dates) during that year (i.e., week 1 to [52 or 53](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Week_dates)).

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;input type=&quot;week&quot;&gt;", "tabbed-shorter")}}

```html interactive-example
<label for="camp-week">Choose a week in May or June:</label>

<input
  type="week"
  name="week"
  id="camp-week"
  min="2018-W18"
  max="2018-W26"
  required />
```

```css interactive-example
label {
  display: block;
  font:
    1rem "Fira Sans",
    sans-serif;
}

input,
label {
  margin: 0.4rem 0;
}
```

The control's user interface varies from browser to browser; cross-browser support is currently a bit limited, with only Chrome/Opera and Microsoft Edge supporting it at this time. In non-supporting browsers, the control degrades gracefully to function identically to [`<input type="text">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/text).

![An input reading 'week 01, 2017'. The background of the 2017 is the same blue as the focus ring. There are 3 icons in the input: x or clear, a spinner with small up and down arrows, and a larger down arrow. A calendar is a pop-up below the input set to January 2017. The first column of the calendar is the week: 52, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. the full month calendar is to the right of that. The row with Week 1 and January 2 to 8 is highlighted. On the same line as the month, there are buttons to move right and left for the next and previous months.](week-control-chrome.png)

## Value

A string representing the value of the week/year entered into the input. The format of the date and time value used by this input type is described in [Week strings](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Date_and_time_formats#week_strings).

You can set a default value for the input by including a value inside the [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) attribute, like so:

```html
<label for="week">What week would you like to start?</label>
<input id="week" type="week" name="week" value="2017-W01" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Value', 600, 60)}}

One thing to note is that the displayed format may differ from the actual `value`, which is always formatted `yyyy-Www`. When the above value is submitted to the server, for example, browsers may display it as `Week 01, 2017`, but the submitted value will always look like `week=2017-W01`.

You can also get and set the value in JavaScript using the input element's {{domxref("HTMLInputElement.value", "value")}} property, for example:

```js
const weekControl = document.querySelector('input[type="week"]');
weekControl.value = "2017-W45";
```

## Additional attributes

In addition to the attributes common to {{HTMLElement("input")}} elements, week inputs offer the following attributes.

### max

The latest (time-wise) year and week number, in the string format discussed in the [Value](#value) section above, to accept. If the [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) entered into the element exceeds this, the element fails [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation). If the value of the `max` attribute isn't a valid week string, then the element has no maximum value.

This value must be greater than or equal to the year and week specified by the `min` attribute.

### min

The earliest year and week to accept. If the [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) of the element is less than this, the element fails [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Constraint_validation). If a value is specified for `min` that isn't a valid week string, the input has no minimum value.

This value must be less than or equal to the value of the `max` attribute.

### readonly

A Boolean attribute which, if present, means this field cannot be edited by the user. Its `value` can, however, still be changed by JavaScript code directly setting the {{domxref("HTMLInputElement")}} `value` property.

> [!NOTE]
> Because a read-only field cannot have a value, `required` does not have any effect on inputs with the `readonly` attribute also specified.

### step

The `step` attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to, or the special value `any`, which is described below. Only values which are a whole number of steps from the step base are valid. The step base is [`min`](#min) if specified, [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#value) otherwise, or −259,200,000 (the start of week `1970-W01`) if neither is provided.

For `week` inputs, the value of `step` is given in weeks and is treated as a number of milliseconds equal to 604,800,000 times the `step` value (the underlying numeric value is in milliseconds). The default value is 1, indicating 1 week.

A string value of `any` means that no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as [`min`](#min) and [`max`](#max)). In reality, it has the same effect as `1` for `week` inputs because the picker UI only allows selecting whole weeks.

> [!NOTE]
> When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping configuration, the {{Glossary("user agent")}} may round to the nearest valid value, preferring numbers in the positive direction when there are two equally close options.

## Using week inputs

Week inputs sound convenient at first glance, since they provide an easy UI for choosing weeks, and they normalize the data format sent to the server, regardless of the user's browser or locale. However, there are issues with `<input type="week">` because browser support is not guaranteed across all browsers.

We'll look at basic and more complex uses of `<input type="week">`, then offer advice on mitigating the browser support issue later on (see [Handling browser support](#handling_browser_support)).

### Basic uses of week

The most basic use of `<input type="week">` involves a basic `<input>` and {{htmlelement("label")}} element combination, as seen below:

```html
<form>
  <label for="week">What week would you like to start?</label>
  <input id="week" type="week" name="week" />
</form>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Basic_uses_of_week', 600, 40)}}

### Controlling input size

`<input type="week">` doesn't support form sizing attributes such as [`size`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#size). You'll have to resort to [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) for sizing needs.

### Using the step attribute

You should be able to use the [`step`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#step) attribute to vary the number of weeks jumped whenever they are incremented or decremented, however it doesn't seem to have any effect on supporting browsers.

## Validation

By default, `<input type="week">` does not apply any validation to entered values. The UI implementations generally don't let you specify anything that isn't a valid week/year, which is helpful, but it's still possible to submit with the field empty, and you might want to restrict the range of choosable weeks.

### Setting maximum and minimum weeks

You can use the [`min`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#min) and [`max`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#max) attributes to restrict the valid weeks that can be chosen by the user. In the following example we are setting a minimum value of `Week 01, 2017` and a maximum value of `Week 52, 2017`:

```html
<form>
  <label for="week">What week would you like to start?</label>
  <input id="week" type="week" name="week" min="2017-W01" max="2017-W52" />
  <span class="validity"></span>
</form>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Setting_maximum_and_minimum_weeks', 600, 40)}}

Here's the CSS used in the above example. Here we make use of the {{cssxref(":valid")}} and {{cssxref(":invalid")}} CSS properties to style the input based on whether the current value is valid. We had to put the icons on a {{htmlelement("span")}} next to the input, not on the input itself, because in Chrome the generated content is placed inside the form control, and can't be styled or shown effectively.

```css
div {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  position: relative;
}

input[type="number"] {
  width: 100px;
}

input + span {
  padding-right: 30px;
}

input:invalid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✖";
  padding-left: 5px;
}

input:valid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✓";
  padding-left: 5px;
}
```

The result here is that only weeks between W01 and W52 in 2017 will be seen as valid and be selectable in supporting browsers.

### Making week values required

In addition you can use the [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#required) attribute to make filling in the week mandatory. As a result, supporting browsers will display an error if you try to submit an empty week field.

Let's look at an example; here we've set minimum and maximum weeks, and also made the field required:

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <label for="week">What week would you like to start?</label>
    <input
      id="week"
      type="week"
      name="week"
      min="2017-W01"
      max="2017-W52"
      required />
    <span class="validity"></span>
  </div>
  <div>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit form" />
  </div>
</form>
```

If you try to submit the form with no value, the browser displays an error. Try playing with the example now:

{{EmbedLiveSample('Making_week_values_required', 600, 120)}}

Here is a screenshot for those of you who aren't using a supporting browser:

![The week form control has two dashes where the week number should be. A popup with a yellow warning symbol and a 'Please fill out this field' is emanating from the two dashes, which are highlighted in blue, the same blue as the input's focus ring.](week-validation-chrome.png)

> [!WARNING]
> HTML form validation is _not_ a substitute for scripts that ensure that the entered data is in the proper format. It's far too easy for someone to make adjustments to the HTML that allow them to bypass the validation, or to remove it entirely. It's also possible for someone to bypass your HTML entirely and submit the data directly to your server. If your server-side code fails to validate the data it receives, disaster could strike when improperly-formatted data is submitted (or data which is too large, of the wrong type, and so forth).

## Handling browser support

As mentioned above, the major problem with using week inputs right now is browser support: Safari and Firefox don't support it on desktop, and old versions of IE don't support it.

Mobile platforms such as Android and iOS make perfect use of such input types, providing specialist UI controls that make it really easy to select values in a touchscreen environment. For example, the `week` picker on Chrome for Android looks like this:

![A modal popup. The header reads 'set week'. There are two columns: the left has 36 in the middle at full opacity, with 35 above it and 37 below being semi-opaque. On the right side, 2017 is fully opaque. There are no other options. Three text links or buttons on the bottom include 'clear' on the 'left' and 'cancel' and 'set' on the right.](week-chrome-android.png)

Non-supporting browsers gracefully degrade to a text input, but this creates problems both in terms of consistency of user interface (the presented control will be different), and data handling.

The second problem is the more serious. As mentioned earlier, with a `week` input the actual value is always normalized to the format `yyyy-Www`. When the browser falls back to a generic text input, there's nothing to guide the user toward correctly formatting the input (and it's certainly not intuitive). There are multiple ways in which people could write week values; for example:

- `Week 1 2017`
- `Jan 2-8 2017`
- `2017-W01`
- etc.

The best way to deal with week/years in forms in a cross-browser way at the moment is to get the user to enter the week number and year in separate controls ({{htmlelement("select")}} elements being popular; see below for an example), or use JavaScript libraries such as [jQuery date picker](https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/).

## Examples

In this example we create two sets of UI elements for choosing weeks: a native picker created using `<input type="week">`, and a set of two {{htmlelement("select")}} elements for choosing weeks/years in older browsers that don't support the `week` input type.

{{EmbedLiveSample('Examples', 600, 140)}}

The HTML looks like so:

```html
<form>
  <div class="nativeWeekPicker">
    <label for="week">What week would you like to start?</label>
    <input
      id="week"
      type="week"
      name="week"
      min="2017-W01"
      max="2018-W52"
      required />
    <span class="validity"></span>
  </div>
  <p class="fallbackLabel">What week would you like to start?</p>
  <div class="fallbackWeekPicker">
    <div>
      <span>
        <label for="week">Week:</label>
        <select id="fallbackWeek" name="week"></select>
      </span>
      <span>
        <label for="year">Year:</label>
        <select id="year" name="year">
          <option value="2017" selected>2017</option>
          <option value="2018">2018</option>
        </select>
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>
</form>
```

The week values are dynamically generated by the JavaScript code below.

```css hidden
div {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  position: relative;
}

input[type="number"] {
  width: 100px;
}

input + span {
  padding-right: 30px;
}

input:invalid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✖";
  padding-left: 5px;
}

input:valid + span::after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "✓";
  padding-left: 5px;
}
```

The other part of the code that may be of interest is the feature detection code. To detect whether the browser supports `<input type="week">`, we create a new {{htmlelement("input")}} element, try setting its `type` to `week`, then immediately check what its `type` is set to. Non-supporting browsers will return `text`, because the `week` type falls back to type `text`. If `<input type="week">` is not supported, we hide the native picker and show the fallback picker UI ({{htmlelement("select")}}s) instead.

```js
// Get UI elements
const nativePicker = document.querySelector(".nativeWeekPicker");
const fallbackPicker = document.querySelector(".fallbackWeekPicker");
const fallbackLabel = document.querySelector(".fallbackLabel");

const yearSelect = document.querySelector("#year");
const weekSelect = document.querySelector("#fallbackWeek");

// Hide fallback initially
fallbackPicker.style.display = "none";
fallbackLabel.style.display = "none";

// Test whether a new date input falls back to a text input or not
const test = document.createElement("input");

try {
  test.type = "week";
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e.description);
}

// If it does, run the code inside the if () {} block
if (test.type === "text") {
  // Hide the native picker and show the fallback
  nativePicker.style.display = "none";
  fallbackPicker.style.display = "block";
  fallbackLabel.style.display = "block";

  // populate the weeks dynamically
  populateWeeks();
}

function populateWeeks() {
  // Populate the week select with 52 weeks
  for (let i = 1; i <= 52; i++) {
    const option = document.createElement("option");
    option.textContent = i < 10 ? `0${i}` : i;
    weekSelect.appendChild(option);
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Remember that some years have 53 weeks in them (see [Weeks per year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date#Weeks_per_year))! You'll need to take this into consideration when developing production apps.

# <ins>: The Inserted Text element

The **`<ins>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a range of text that has been added to a document. You can use the {{HTMLElement("del")}} element to similarly represent a range of text that has been deleted from the document.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;ins&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<p>&ldquo;You're late!&rdquo;</p>
<del>
  <p>&ldquo;I apologize for the delay.&rdquo;</p>
</del>
<ins cite="../how-to-be-a-wizard.html" datetime="2018-05">
  <p>&ldquo;A wizard is never late &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
</ins>
```

```css interactive-example
del,
ins {
  display: block;
  text-decoration: none;
  position: relative;
}

del {
  background-color: #ffbbbb;
}

ins {
  background-color: #d4fcbc;
}

del::before,
ins::before {
  position: absolute;
  left: 0.5rem;
  font-family: monospace;
}

del::before {
  content: "−";
}

ins::before {
  content: "+";
}

p {
  margin: 0 1.8rem;
  font-family: "Georgia", serif;
  font-size: 1rem;
}
```

## Attributes

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

- `cite`
  - : This attribute defines the URI of a resource that explains the change, such as a link to meeting minutes or a ticket in a troubleshooting system.
- `datetime`
  - : This attribute indicates the time and date of the change and must be a valid date with an optional time string. If the value cannot be parsed as a date with an optional time string, the element does not have an associated timestamp. For the format of the string without a time, see [Format of a valid date string](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Date_and_time_formats#date_strings). The format of the string if it includes both date and time is covered in [Format of a valid local date and time string](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Date_and_time_formats#local_date_and_time_strings).

## Accessibility

The presence of the `<ins>` element is not announced by most screen reading technology in its default configuration. It can be made to be announced by using the CSS {{cssxref("content")}} property, along with the {{cssxref("::before")}} and {{cssxref("::after")}} pseudo-elements.

```css
ins::before,
ins::after {
  clip-path: inset(100%);
  clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
  height: 1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  position: absolute;
  white-space: nowrap;
  width: 1px;
}

ins::before {
  content: " [insertion start] ";
}

ins::after {
  content: " [insertion end] ";
}
```

Some people who use screen readers deliberately disable announcing content that creates extra verbosity. Because of this, it is important to not abuse this technique and only apply it in situations where not knowing content has been inserted would adversely affect understanding.

# <kbd>: The Keyboard Input element

The **`<kbd>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a span of inline text denoting textual user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text entry device. By convention, the {{Glossary("user agent")}} defaults to rendering the contents of a `<kbd>` element using its default monospace font, although this is not mandated by the HTML standard.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;kbd&gt;", "tabbed-shorter")}}

```html interactive-example
<p>
  Please press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to re-render an
  MDN page.
</p>
```

```css interactive-example
kbd {
  background-color: #eeeeee;
  border-radius: 3px;
  border: 1px solid #b4b4b4;
  box-shadow:
    0 1px 1px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.2),
    0 2px 0 0 rgb(255 255 255 / 0.7) inset;
  color: #333333;
  display: inline-block;
  font-size: 0.85em;
  font-weight: 700;
  line-height: 1;
  padding: 2px 4px;
  white-space: nowrap;
}
```

`<kbd>` may be nested in various combinations with the {{HTMLElement("samp")}} (Sample Output) element to represent various forms of input or output based on visual cues.

## Attributes

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

## Usage notes

Other elements can be used in tandem with `<kbd>` to represent more specific scenarios:

- Nesting a `<kbd>` element within another `<kbd>` element represents an actual key or other unit of input as a portion of a larger input. See [Representing keystrokes within an input](#representing_keystrokes_within_an_input) below.
- Nesting a `<kbd>` element inside a {{HTMLElement("samp")}} element represents input that has been echoed back to the user by the system. See [Echoed input](#echoed_input), below, for an example.
- Nesting a `<samp>` element inside a `<kbd>` element, on the other hand, represents input which is based on text presented by the system, such as the names of menus and menu items, or the names of buttons displayed on the screen. See the example under [Representing onscreen input options](#representing_onscreen_input_options) below.

> [!NOTE]
> You can define a custom style to override the browser's default font selection for the `<kbd>` element, although the user's preferences may potentially override your CSS.

## Examples

### Basic example

```html
<p>
  Use the command <kbd>help my-command</kbd> to view documentation for the
  command "my-command".
</p>
```

#### Result

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Basic_example', 350, 80) }}

### Representing keystrokes within an input

To describe an input comprised of multiple keystrokes, you can nest multiple `<kbd>` elements, with an outer `<kbd>` element representing the overall input and each individual keystroke or component of the input enclosed within its own `<kbd>`.

#### Unstyled

First, let's look at what this looks like as just plain HTML.

##### HTML

```html
<p>
  You can also create a new document using the
  <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd></kbd> keyboard shortcut.
</p>
```

This wraps the entire key sequence in an outer `<kbd>` element, then each individual key within its own, in order to denote the components of the sequence.

> [!NOTE]
> You don't need to do all this wrapping; you can choose to simplify it by leaving out the external `<kbd>` element. In other words, simplifying this to just `<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd>` would be perfectly valid.
>
> Depending on your style sheet, though, you may find it useful to do this kind of nesting.

##### Result

The output looks like this without a style sheet applied:

{{EmbedLiveSample("Unstyled", 650, 80)}}

#### With custom styles

We can make more sense of this by adding some CSS:

##### CSS

We add a new selector for nested `<kbd>` elements, `kbd>kbd`, which we can apply when rendering keyboard keys:

```css
kbd > kbd {
  border-radius: 3px;
  padding: 1px 2px 0;
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```

##### HTML

Then we update the HTML to use this class on the keys in the output to be presented:

```html
<p>
  You can also create a new document by pressing the
  <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd></kbd> shortcut.
</p>
```

##### Result

The result is just what we want!

{{EmbedLiveSample("With_custom_styles", 650, 80)}}

### Echoed input

Nesting a `<kbd>` element inside a {{HTMLElement("samp")}} element represents input that has been echoed back to the user by the system.

```html
<p>
  If a syntax error occurs, the tool will output the initial command you typed
  for your review:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <samp><kbd>custom-git ad my-new-file.cpp</kbd></samp>
</blockquote>
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Echoed_input", 650, 100)}}

### Representing onscreen input options

Nesting a `<samp>` element inside a `<kbd>` element represents input which is based on text presented by the system, such as the names of menus and menu items, or the names of buttons displayed on the screen.

For example, you can explain how to choose the "New Document" option in the "File" menu using HTML that looks like this:

```html-nolint
<p>
  To create a new file, choose the <kbd><kbd><samp>File</samp></kbd>
  ⇒<kbd><samp>New Document</samp></kbd></kbd> menu option.
</p>

<p>
  Don't forget to click the <kbd><samp>OK</samp></kbd> button to confirm once
  you've entered the name of the new file.
</p>
```

This does some interesting nesting. For the menu option description, the entire input is enclosed in a `<kbd>` element. Then, inside that, both the menu and menu item names are contained within both `<kbd>` and `<samp>`, indicating an input which is selected from a screen widget.

#### Result

# <label>: The Label element

}
```

## Attributes

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

- [`for`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/for)
  - : The value is the [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/id) of the [labelable](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Content_categories#labelable) form control in the same document, [associating the `<label>` with that form control](#associating_a_label_with_a_form_control). Note that its JavaScript reflection property is [`htmlFor`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLLabelElement/htmlFor).

## Usage notes

### Associating a label with a form control

The first element in the document with an `id` attribute matching the value of the `for` attribute is the _labeled control_ for this `label` element — if the element with that `id` is actually a [labelable element](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Content_categories#labelable). If it is _not_ a labelable element, then the `for` attribute has no effect. If there are other elements that also match the `id` value, later in the document, they are not considered.

Multiple `<label>` elements can be associated with the same form control by having multiple `<label>` elements with the same `for` attribute value, which gives the form control multiple labels.

Associating a `<label>` with a form control, such as {{htmlelement("input")}} or {{htmlelement("textarea")}} offers some major advantages:

- The label text is not only visually associated with its corresponding text input; it is programmatically associated with it too. This means that, for example, a screen reader will read out the label when the user is focused on the form input, making it easier for an assistive technology user to understand what data should be entered.
- When a user clicks or touches/taps a label, the browser passes the focus to its associated input (the resulting event is also raised for the input). That increased hit area for focusing the input provides an advantage to anyone trying to activate it — including those using a touch-screen device.

There are two ways to associate a `<label>` with a form control, commonly referred to as _explicit_ and _implicit_ association.

To explicitly associate a `<label>` element with an `<input>` element, you first need to add the `id` attribute to the `<input>` element. Next, you add the `for` attribute to the `<label>` element, where the value of `for` is the same as the `id` in the `<input>` element.

```html
<label for="peas">I like peas.</label>
<input type="checkbox" name="peas" id="peas" />
```

Alternatively, you can nest the `<input>` directly inside the `<label>`, in which case the `for` and `id` attributes are not needed because the association is implicit:

```html
<label>
  I like peas.
  <input type="checkbox" name="peas" />
</label>
```

> [!NOTE]
> A `<label>` element can have both a `for` attribute and a contained control element, as long as the `for` attribute points to the contained control element.

These two methods are equivalent, but there are a few considerations:

- While common browser and {{glossary("screen reader")}} combinations support implicit association, not all assistive technologies do.
- Depending on your design, the type of association may impact stylability. Making the `<label>` and form control sibling elements instead of parent-child means they are separate, adjacent boxes, enabling more customizable layout such as lining them up with grid or flex layout methods.
- Explicit association requires the form control to have an `id`, which must be unique in the whole document. This is hard especially in a componentized application. Frameworks often provide their own solutions, such as React's [`useId()`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useId), but it still requires extra orchestration to get right.

Generally, we recommend using explicit association with the `for` attribute, to ensure compatibility with external tools and assistive technologies. In fact, you can simultaneously nest _and_ provide `id`/`for` for maximum compatibility.

The form control that a label is labeling is called the _labeled control_ of the label element. Multiple labels can be associated with the same form control:

```html
<label for="username">Enter your username:</label>
<input id="username" name="username" type="text" />
<label for="username">Forgot your username?</label>
```

Elements that can be associated with a `<label>` element include {{HTMLElement('button')}}, {{HTMLElement('input')}} (except for `type="hidden"`), {{HTMLElement('meter')}}, {{HTMLElement('output')}}, {{HTMLElement('progress')}}, {{HTMLElement('select')}} and {{HTMLElement('textarea')}}.

## Accessibility

### Interactive content

Other than the [implicitly associated](#associating_a_label_with_a_form_control) form control, don't place additional interactive elements such as {{HTMLElement("a", "anchors")}} or {{HTMLElement("button", "buttons")}} inside a `<label>`. Doing so makes it difficult for people to activate the form input associated with the `label`.

**Don't do this:**

```html example-bad
<label for="tac">
  <input id="tac" type="checkbox" name="terms-and-conditions" />
  I agree to the <a href="terms-and-conditions.html">Terms and Conditions</a>
</label>
```

**Prefer this:**

```html example-good
<p>
  <a href="terms-and-conditions.html">Read our Terms and Conditions</a>
</p>
<label for="tac">
  <input id="tac" type="checkbox" name="terms-and-conditions" />
  I agree to the Terms and Conditions
</label>
```

> [!NOTE]
> It is a good practice to place any necessary context, such as the link to the terms and conditions, before the form control, so that the user can read it before they interact with the control.

### Headings

Placing [heading elements](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/Heading_Elements) within a `<label>` interferes with many kinds of assistive technology, because headings are commonly used as [a navigation aid](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/Heading_Elements#navigation). If the label's text needs to be adjusted visually, use CSS classes applied to the `<label>` element instead.

If a [form](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form), or a section of a form needs a title, use the {{HTMLElement("legend")}} element placed within a {{HTMLElement("fieldset")}}.

**Don't do this:**

```html example-bad
<label for="your-name">
  <h3>Your name</h3>
  <input id="your-name" name="your-name" type="text" />
</label>
```

**Prefer this:**

```html example-good
<label class="large-label" for="your-name">
  Your name
  <input id="your-name" name="your-name" type="text" />
</label>
```

### Buttons

An {{HTMLElement("input")}} element with a `type="button"` declaration and a valid `value` attribute does not need a label associated with it. Doing so may actually interfere with how assistive technology parses the button input. The same applies for the {{HTMLElement("button")}} element.

## Examples

### Defining an implicit label

```html
<label>Click me <input type="text" /></label>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Defining an implicit label', '200', '50')}}

### Defining an explicit label with the "for" attribute

```html
<label for="username">Click me to focus on the input field</label>
<input type="text" id="username" />
```

# <legend>: The Field Set Legend element

The **`<legend>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a caption for the content of its parent {{HTMLElement("fieldset")}}.

In [customizable `<select>` elements](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Customizable_select), the `<legend>` element is allowed as a child of `<optgroup>`, to provide a label that is easy to target and style. This replaces any text set in the `<optgroup>` element's `label` attribute, and it has the same semantics.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;legend&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<fieldset>
  <legend>Choose your favorite monster</legend>

  <input type="radio" id="kraken" name="monster" value="K" />
  <label for="kraken">Kraken</label><br />

  <input type="radio" id="sasquatch" name="monster" value="S" />
  <label for="sasquatch">Sasquatch</label><br />

  <input type="radio" id="mothman" name="monster" value="M" />
  <label for="mothman">Mothman</label>
</fieldset>
```

```css interactive-example
legend {
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
  padding: 3px 6px;
}

input {
  margin: 0.4rem;
}
```

# <li>: The List Item element

The **`<li>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used to represent an item in a list. It must be contained in a parent element: an ordered list ({{HTMLElement("ol")}}), an unordered list ({{HTMLElement("ul")}}), or a menu ({{HTMLElement("menu")}}). In menus and unordered lists, list items are usually displayed using bullet points. In ordered lists, they are usually displayed with an ascending counter on the left, such as a number or letter.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;li&gt;", "tabbed-shorter")}}

```html interactive-example
<p>Apollo astronauts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Neil Armstrong</li>
  <li>Alan Bean</li>
  <li>Peter Conrad</li>
  <li>Edgar Mitchell</li>
  <li>Alan Shepard</li>
</ul>
```

```css interactive-example
p,
li {
  font:
    1rem "Fira Sans",
    sans-serif;
}

p {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

## Attributes

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

- `value`
  - : This integer attribute indicates the current ordinal value of the list item as defined by the {{HTMLElement("ol")}} element. The only allowed value for this attribute is a number, even if the list is displayed with Roman numerals or letters. List items that follow this one continue numbering from the value set. This attribute has no meaning for unordered lists ({{HTMLElement("ul")}}) or for menus ({{HTMLElement("menu")}}).
- `type` {{Deprecated_inline}}
  - : This character attribute indicates the numbering type:
    - `a`: lowercase letters
    - `A`: uppercase letters
    - `i`: lowercase Roman numerals
    - `I`: uppercase Roman numerals
    - `1`: numbers

    This type overrides the one used by its parent {{HTMLElement("ol")}} element, if any.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This attribute has been deprecated; use the CSS {{cssxref("list-style-type")}} property instead.

## Examples

# <link>: The External Resource Link element

The **`<link>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource.
This element is most commonly used to link to {{Glossary("CSS", "stylesheets")}}, but is also used to establish site icons (both "favicon" style icons and icons for the home screen and apps on mobile devices) among other things.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;link&gt;", "tabbed-shorter")}}

```html interactive-example
<link href="/shared-assets/misc/link-element-example.css" rel="stylesheet" />

<p>This text will be red as defined in the external stylesheet.</p>
<p style="color: blue">
  The <code>style</code> attribute can override it, though.
</p>
```

To link an external stylesheet, you'd include a `<link>` element inside your {{HTMLElement("head")}} like this:

```html
<link href="main.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

This example provides the path to the stylesheet inside an `href` attribute and a [`rel`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel) attribute with a value of `stylesheet`. The `rel` stands for "relationship", and is one of the key features of the `<link>` element — the value denotes how the item being linked to is related to the containing document.

There are a number of other common types you'll come across. For example, a link to the site's favicon:

```html
<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" />
```

There are a number of other icon `rel` values, mainly used to indicate special icon types for use on various mobile platforms, e.g.:

```html
<link
  rel="apple-touch-icon"
  sizes="114x114"
  href="apple-icon-114.png"
  type="image/png" />
```

The `sizes` attribute indicates the icon size, while the `type` contains the MIME type of the resource being linked.
These provide useful hints to allow the browser to choose the most appropriate icon available.

You can also provide a media type or query inside a `media` attribute; this resource will then only be loaded if the media condition is true. For example:

```html
<link href="print.css" rel="stylesheet" media="print" />
<link href="mobile.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (width <= 600px)" />
```

Some interesting new performance and security features have been added to the `<link>` element too. Take this example:

```html
<link
  rel="preload"
  href="myFont.woff2"
  as="font"
  type="font/woff2"
  crossorigin="anonymous" />
```

A `rel` value of `preload` indicates that the browser should preload this resource (see [`rel="preload"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel/preload) for more details), with the `as` attribute indicating the specific class of content being fetched.
The `crossorigin` attribute indicates whether the resource should be fetched with a {{Glossary("CORS")}} request.

Other usage notes:

- A `<link>` element can occur either in the {{HTMLElement("head")}} or {{HTMLElement("body")}} element, depending on whether it has a [link type](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/links.html#body-ok) that is **body-ok**.
  For example, the `stylesheet` link type is body-ok, and therefore `<link rel="stylesheet">` is permitted in the body.
  However, this isn't a good practice to follow; it makes more sense to separate your `<link>` elements from your body content, putting them in the `<head>`.
- When using `<link>` to establish a favicon for a site, and your site uses a Content Security Policy (CSP) to enhance its security, the policy applies to the favicon.
  If you encounter problems with the favicon not loading, verify that the {{HTTPHeader("Content-Security-Policy")}} header's [`img-src` directive](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/img-src) is not preventing access to it.
- The HTML and XHTML specifications define event handlers for the `<link>` element, but it is unclear how they would be used.
- Under XHTML 1.0, {{glossary("void element", "void elements")}} such as `<link>` require a trailing slash: `<link />`.
- WebTV supports the use of the value `next` for `rel` to preload the next page in a document series.

## Attributes

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

- `as`
  - : This attribute is required when [`rel="preload"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel/preload) has been set on the `<link>` element, optional when [`rel="modulepreload"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel/modulepreload) has been set, and otherwise should not be used.
    It specifies the type of content being loaded by the `<link>`, which is necessary for request matching, application of correct [content security policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP), and setting of correct {{HTTPHeader("Accept")}} request header.

    Furthermore, `rel="preload"` uses this as a signal for request prioritization.
    The table below lists the valid values for this attribute and the elements or resources they apply to.

- `blocking`
  - : This attribute explicitly indicates that certain operations should be blocked until specific conditions are met. It must only be used when the `rel` attribute contains the `expect` or `stylesheet` keywords. With [`rel="expect"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel#expect), it indicates that operations should be blocked until a specific DOM node has been parsed. With [`rel="stylesheet"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel#stylesheet), it indicates that operations should be blocked until an external stylesheet and its critical subresources have been fetched and applied to the document. The operations that are to be blocked must be a space-separated list of blocking tokens listed below. Currently there is only one token:
    - `render`: The rendering of content on the screen is blocked.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Only `link` elements in the document's `<head>` can possibly block rendering. By default, a `link` element with `rel="stylesheet"` in the `<head>` blocks rendering when the browser discovers it during parsing. If such a `link` element is added dynamically via script, you must additionally set `blocking = "render"` for it to block rendering.

- [`crossorigin`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/crossorigin)
  - : This [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) attribute indicates whether {{Glossary("CORS")}} must be used when fetching the resource.
    [CORS-enabled images](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/How_to/CORS_enabled_image) can be reused in the {{HTMLElement("canvas")}} element without being _tainted_.
    The allowed values are:
    - `anonymous`
      - : A cross-origin request (i.e., with an {{HTTPHeader("Origin")}} HTTP header) is performed, but no credential is sent (i.e., no cookie, X.509 certificate, or HTTP Basic authentication).
        If the server does not give credentials to the origin site (by not setting the {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin")}} HTTP header) the resource will be tainted and its usage restricted.
    - `use-credentials`
      - : A cross-origin request (i.e., with an `Origin` HTTP header) is performed along with a credential sent (i.e., a cookie, certificate, and/or HTTP Basic authentication is performed).
        If the server does not give credentials to the origin site (through {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Credentials")}} HTTP header), the resource will be _tainted_ and its usage restricted.

    If the attribute is not present, the resource is fetched without a {{Glossary("CORS")}} request (i.e., without sending the `Origin` HTTP header), preventing its non-tainted usage. If invalid, it is handled as if the enumerated keyword **anonymous** was used.
    See [CORS settings attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/crossorigin) for additional information.

- `disabled`
  - : For `rel="stylesheet"` only, the `disabled` Boolean attribute indicates whether the described stylesheet should be loaded and applied to the document.
    If `disabled` is specified in the HTML when it is loaded, the stylesheet will not be loaded during page load.
    Instead, the stylesheet will be loaded on-demand, if and when the `disabled` attribute is changed to `false` or removed.

    Setting the `disabled` property in the DOM causes the stylesheet to be removed from the document's {{domxref("Document.styleSheets")}} list.

- `fetchpriority`
  - : Provides a hint of the relative priority to use when fetching a resource of a particular type.
    Allowed values:
    - `high`
      - : Fetch the resource at a high priority relative to other resources of the same type.
    - `low`
      - : Fetch the resource at a low priority relative to other resources of the same type.
    - `auto`
      - : Don't set a preference for the fetch priority.
        This is the default.
        It is used if no value or an invalid value is set.

    See {{domxref("HTMLLinkElement.fetchPriority")}} for more information.

- `href`
  - : This attribute specifies the {{glossary("URL")}} of the linked resource. A URL can be absolute or relative.
- `hreflang`
  - : This attribute indicates the language of the linked resource.
    It is purely advisory.
    Values should be valid {{glossary("BCP 47 language tag", "BCP 47 language tags")}}.
    Use this attribute only if the [`href`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/a#href) attribute is present.
- `imagesizes`
  - : For `rel="preload"` and `as="image"` only, the `imagesizes` attribute has similar syntax and semantics as the [`sizes`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/img#sizes) attribute that indicates to preload the appropriate resource used by an `img` element with corresponding values for its `srcset` and `sizes` attributes.
- `imagesrcset`
  - : For `rel="preload"` and `as="image"` only, the `imagesrcset` attribute has similar syntax and semantics as the [`srcset`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/img#srcset) attribute that indicates to preload the appropriate resource used by an `img` element with corresponding values for its `srcset` and `sizes` attributes.
- `integrity`
  - : Contains inline metadata — a base64-encoded cryptographic hash of the resource (file) you're telling the browser to fetch.
    The browser can use this to verify that the fetched resource has been delivered without unexpected manipulation.
    The attribute must only be specified when the `rel` attribute is specified to `stylesheet`, `preload`, or `modulepreload`.
    See [Subresource Integrity](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity).
- `media`
  - : This attribute specifies the media that the linked resource applies to. Its value must be a media type / [media query](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries).
    This attribute is mainly useful when linking to external stylesheets — it allows the user agent to pick the best adapted one for the device it runs on.

- `referrerpolicy`
  - : A string indicating which referrer to use when fetching the resource:
    - `no-referrer` means that the {{HTTPHeader("Referer")}} header will not be sent.
    - `no-referrer-when-downgrade` means that no {{HTTPHeader("Referer")}} header will be sent when navigating to an origin without TLS (HTTPS).
      This is a user agent's default behavior, if no policy is otherwise specified.
    - `origin` means that the referrer will be the origin of the page, which is roughly the scheme, the host, and the port.
    - `origin-when-cross-origin` means that navigating to other origins will be limited to the scheme, the host, and the port, while navigating on the same origin will include the referrer's path.
    - `unsafe-url` means that the referrer will include the origin and the path (but not the fragment, password, or username).
      This case is unsafe because it can leak origins and paths from TLS-protected resources to insecure origins.

- [`rel`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel)
  - : This attribute names a relationship of the linked document to the current document. The attribute must be a space-separated list of [link type values](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel).
- `sizes`
  - : This attribute defines the sizes of the icons for visual media contained in the resource.
    It must be present only if the [`rel`](#rel) contains a value of `icon` or a non-standard type such as Apple's `apple-touch-icon`.
    It may have the following values:
    - `any`, meaning that the icon can be scaled to any size as it is in a vector format, like `image/svg+xml`.
    - a white-space separated list of sizes, each in the format `<width in pixels>x<height in pixels>` or `<width in pixels>X<height in pixels>`. Each of these sizes must be contained in the resource.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Most icon formats are only able to store one single icon; therefore, most of the time, the [`sizes`](#sizes) attribute contains only one entry.
    > Microsoft's ICO format and Apple's ICNS format can store multiple icon sizes in a single file. ICO has better browser support, so you should use this format if cross-browser support is a concern.

- `title`
  - : The `title` attribute has special semantics on the `<link>` element.
    When used on a `<link rel="stylesheet">` it defines a [default or an alternate stylesheet](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel/alternate_stylesheet).
- `type`
  - : This attribute is used to define the type of the content linked to.
    The value of the attribute should be a MIME type such as **text/html**, **text/css**, and so on.
    The common use of this attribute is to define the type of stylesheet being referenced (such as **text/css**), but given that CSS is the only stylesheet language used on the web, not only is it possible to omit the `type` attribute, but is actually now recommended practice.
    It is also used on `rel="preload"` link types, to make sure the browser only downloads file types that it supports.

### Non-standard attributes

- `target` {{Deprecated_Inline}}
  - : Defines the frame or window name that has the defined linking relationship or that will show the rendering of any linked resource.

### Obsolete attributes

- `charset` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : This attribute defines the character encoding of the linked resource.
    The value is a space- and/or comma-delimited list of character sets as defined in {{rfc(2045)}}.
    The default value is `iso-8859-1`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To produce the same effect as this obsolete attribute, use the {{HTTPHeader("Content-Type")}} HTTP header on the linked resource.

- `rev` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : The value of this attribute shows the relationship of the current document to the linked document, as defined by the [`href`](#href) attribute.
    The attribute thus defines the reverse relationship compared to the value of the `rel` attribute.
    [Link type values](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel) for the attribute are similar to the possible values for [`rel`](#rel).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Instead of `rev`, you should use the [`rel`](#rel) attribute with the opposite [link type value](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel).
    > For example, to establish the reverse link for `made`, specify `author`. Also, this attribute doesn't stand for "revision" and must not be used with a version number, even though many sites misuse it in this way.

## Examples

### Including a stylesheet

To include a stylesheet in a page, use the following syntax:

```html
<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

### Providing alternative stylesheets

You can also specify [alternative style sheets](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel/alternate_stylesheet).

The user can choose which style sheet to use by choosing it from the **View > Page Style** menu.
This provides a way for users to see multiple versions of a page.

```html
<link href="default.css" rel="stylesheet" title="Default Style" />
<link href="fancy.css" rel="alternate stylesheet" title="Fancy" />
<link href="basic.css" rel="alternate stylesheet" title="Basic" />
```

### Providing icons for different usage contexts

You can include links to several icons on the same page, and the browser will choose which one works best for its particular context using the `rel` and `sizes` values as hints.

```html
<!-- iPad Pro with high-resolution Retina display: -->
<link
  rel="apple-touch-icon"
  sizes="167x167"
  href="/apple-touch-icon-167x167.png" />
<!-- 3x resolution iPhone: -->
<link
  rel="apple-touch-icon"
  sizes="180x180"
  href="/apple-touch-icon-180x180.png" />
<!-- non-Retina iPad, iPad mini, etc.: -->
<link
  rel="apple-touch-icon"
  sizes="152x152"
  href="/apple-touch-icon-152x152.png" />
<!-- 2x resolution iPhone and other devices: -->
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/apple-touch-icon-120x120.png" />
<!-- basic favicon -->
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
```

For information about what `sizes` to choose for Apple icons, see [Apple's documentation on configuring web applications](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002051-CH3-SW4) and the referenced [Apple human interface guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons#App-icon-sizes). Usually, it is sufficient to provide a large image, such as 192x192, and let the browser scale it down as needed, but you may want to provide images with different levels of detail for different sizes, as the Apple design guideline recommends. Providing smaller icons for lower resolutions also saves bandwidth.

It may not be necessary to provide `<link>` elements at all. For example, browsers automatically request `/favicon.ico` from the root of a site, and Apple also automatically requests `/apple-touch-icon-[size].png`, `/apple-touch-icon.png`, etc. However, providing explicit links protects you against changes to these conventions.

### Conditionally loading resources with media queries

You can provide a media type or query inside a `media` attribute;
this resource will then only be loaded if the media condition is true. For example:

```html
<link href="print.css" rel="stylesheet" media="print" />
<link href="mobile.css" rel="stylesheet" media="all" />
<link href="desktop.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (width >= 600px)" />
<link
  href="highres.css"
  rel="stylesheet"
  media="screen and (resolution >= 300dpi)" />
```

### Stylesheet load events

You can determine when a style sheet has been loaded by watching for a `load` event to fire on it; similarly, you can detect if an error has occurred while processing a style sheet by watching for an `error` event:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystylesheet.css" id="my-stylesheet" />
```

```js
const stylesheet = document.getElementById("my-stylesheet");

stylesheet.onload = () => {
  // Do something interesting; the sheet has been loaded
};

stylesheet.onerror = () => {
  console.log("An error occurred loading the stylesheet!");
};
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `load` event fires once the stylesheet and all of its imported content has been loaded and parsed, and immediately before the styles start being applied to the content.

### Preload examples

You can find a number of `<link rel="preload">` examples in [Preloading content with `rel="preload"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel/preload).

### Blocking rendering till a resource is fetched

You can include `render` token inside a `blocking` attribute;
the rendering of the page will be blocked till the resource and its critical subresources are fetched and applied to the document. For example:

```html
<link blocking="render" rel="stylesheet" href="example.css" crossorigin />
```

# <main>: The Main element

The **`<main>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents the dominant content of the {{HTMLElement("body")}} of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;main&gt;", "tabbed-shorter")}}

```html interactive-example
<header>Gecko facts</header>

<main>
  <p>
    Geckos are a group of usually small, usually nocturnal lizards. They are
    found on every continent except Antarctica.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many species of gecko have adhesive toe pads which enable them to climb
    walls and even windows.
  </p>
</main>
```

```css interactive-example
header {
  font:
    bold 7vw "Arial",
    sans-serif;
}
```

A document mustn't have more than one `<main>` element that doesn't have the [`hidden`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/hidden) attribute specified.

## Attributes

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

## Usage notes

The content of a `<main>` element should be unique to the document. Content that is repeated across a set of documents or document sections such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms shouldn't be included unless the search form is the main function of the page.

`<main>` doesn't contribute to the document's outline; that is, unlike elements such as {{HTMLElement("body")}}, headings such as {{HTMLElement("Heading_Elements", "h2")}}, and such, `<main>` doesn't affect the {{glossary("DOM", "DOM's")}} concept of the structure of the page. It's strictly informative.

## Accessibility

### Landmark

The `<main>` element behaves like a [`main` landmark](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/main_role) role. [Landmarks](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Guides/Techniques#landmark_roles) can be used by assistive technology to quickly identify and navigate to large sections of the document. Prefer using the `<main>` element over declaring `role="main"`, unless there are [legacy browser support concerns](#browser_compatibility).

### Skip navigation

Skip navigation, also known as "skipnav", is a technique that allows an assistive technology user to quickly bypass large sections of repeated content (main navigation, info banners, etc.). This lets the user access the main content of the page faster.

Adding an [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/id) attribute to the `<main>` element lets it be a target of a skip navigation link.

```html
<body>
  <a href="#main-content">Skip to main content</a>

  <!-- navigation and header content -->

  <main id="main-content">
    <!-- main page content -->
  </main>
</body>
```

- [WebAIM: "Skip Navigation" Links](https://webaim.org/techniques/skipnav/)

### Reader mode

Browser reader mode functionality looks for the presence of the `<main>` element, as well as [heading](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/Heading_Elements) and [content sectioning elements](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements#content_sectioning) when converting content into a specialized reader view.

# <map>: The Image Map element

The **`<map>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used with {{HTMLElement("area")}} elements to define an image map (a clickable link area).

```

## Attributes

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

- `name`
  - : The `name` attribute gives the map a name so that it can be referenced. The attribute must be present and must have a non-empty value with no space characters. The value of the `name` attribute must not be equal to the value of the `name` attribute of another `<map>` element in the same document. If the [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/id) attribute is also specified, both attributes must have the same value.

# <mark>: The Mark Text element

The **`<mark>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents text which is **marked** or **highlighted** for reference or notation purposes due to the marked passage's relevance in the enclosing context.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;mark&gt;", "tabbed-shorter")}}

```html interactive-example
<p>Search results for "salamander":</p>

<hr />

<p>
  Several species of <mark>salamander</mark> inhabit the temperate rainforest of
  the Pacific Northwest.
</p>

<p>
  Most <mark>salamander</mark>s are nocturnal, and hunt for insects, worms, and
  other small creatures.
</p>
```

```css interactive-example
mark {
  /* Add your styles here */
}
```

## Attributes

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

## Usage notes

Typical use cases for `<mark>` include:

- When used in a quotation ({{HTMLElement("q")}}) or block quote ({{HTMLElement("blockquote")}}), it generally indicates text which is of special interest but is not marked in the original source material, or material which needs special scrutiny even though the original author didn't think it was of particular importance. Think of this like using a highlighter pen in a book to mark passages that you find of interest.
- Otherwise, `<mark>` indicates a portion of the document's content which is likely to be relevant to the user's current activity. This might be used, for example, to indicate the words that matched a search operation.
- Don't use `<mark>` for syntax highlighting purposes; instead, use the {{HTMLElement("span")}} element with appropriate CSS applied to it.

> [!NOTE]
> Don't confuse `<mark>` with the {{HTMLElement("strong")}} element; `<mark>` is used to denote content which has a degree of _relevance_, while `<strong>` indicates spans of text of _importance_.

## Accessibility

The presence of the `mark` element is not announced by most screen reading technology in its default configuration. It can be made to be announced by using the CSS {{cssxref("content")}} property, along with the {{cssxref("::before")}} and {{cssxref("::after")}} pseudo-elements.

```css
mark::before,
mark::after {
  clip-path: inset(100%);
  clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
  height: 1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  position: absolute;
  white-space: nowrap;
  width: 1px;
}

mark::before {
  content: " [highlight start] ";
}

mark::after {
  content: " [highlight end] ";
}
```

Some people who use screen readers deliberately disable announcing content that creates extra verbosity. Because of this, it is important to not abuse this technique and only apply it in situations where not knowing content has been highlighted would adversely affect understanding.

## Examples

### Marking text of interest

In this first example, a `<mark>` element is used to mark some text within a quote which is of particular interest to the user.

```html
<blockquote>
  It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base,
  have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the
  battle, <mark>Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans</mark> to the Empire's
  ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armored space station with enough power to
  destroy an entire planet.
</blockquote>
```

### Identifying context-sensitive passages

This example demonstrates using `<mark>` to mark search results within a passage.

```html
<p>
  It is a dark time for the Rebellion. Although the Death Star has been
  destroyed, <mark class="match">Imperial</mark> troops have driven the Rebel
  forces from their hidden base and pursued them across the galaxy.
</p>

<p>
  Evading the dreaded <mark class="match">Imperial</mark> Starfleet, a group of
  freedom fighters led by Luke Skywalker has established a new secret base on
  the remote ice world of Hoth.
</p>
```

To help distinguish the use of `<mark>` for search results from other potential usage, this example applies the custom class `"match"` to each match.

# <marquee>: The Marquee element

{{Deprecated_Header}}

The **`<marquee>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used to insert a scrolling area of text. You can control what happens when the text reaches the edges of its content area using its attributes.

The HTML `<marquee>` element is deprecated and its use is strongly discouraged. If you must create the effect of scrolling text or continuous elements, consider using [CSS animations](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animations) with [CSS transforms](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_transforms/Using_CSS_transforms) instead of `<marquee>` elements to smoothly animate content. Additionally, include the [`prefers-reduced-motion`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion) CSS {{cssxref("@media")}} query to stop the animation based on user preference, thereby improving user experience and accessibility.

## Attributes

- `behavior` {{Deprecated_Inline}}
  - : Sets how the text is scrolled within the marquee. Possible values are `scroll`, `slide` and `alternate`. If no value is specified, the default value is `scroll`.
- `bgcolor` {{Deprecated_Inline}}
  - : Sets the background color through color name or hexadecimal value.
- `direction` {{Deprecated_Inline}}
  - : Sets the direction of the scrolling within the marquee. Possible values are `left`, `right`, `up` and `down`. If no value is specified, the default value is `left`.
- `height` {{Deprecated_Inline}}
  - : Sets the height in pixels or percentage value.
- `hspace` {{Deprecated_Inline}}
  - : Sets the horizontal margin
- `loop` {{Deprecated_Inline}}
  - : Sets the number of times the marquee will scroll. If no value is specified, the default value is −1, which means the marquee will scroll continuously.
- `scrollamount` {{Deprecated_Inline}}
  - : Sets the amount of scrolling at each interval in pixels. The default value is 6.
- `scrolldelay` {{Deprecated_Inline}}
  - : Sets the interval between each scroll movement in milliseconds. The default value is 85. Note that any value smaller than 60 is ignored and the value 60 is used instead unless `truespeed` is specified.
- `truespeed` {{Deprecated_Inline}}
  - : By default, `scrolldelay` values lower than 60 are ignored. If `truespeed` is present, those values are not ignored.
- `vspace` {{Deprecated_Inline}}
  - : Sets the vertical margin in pixels or percentage value.
- `width` {{Deprecated_Inline}}
  - : Sets the width in pixels or percentage value.

## Examples

```html
<marquee>This text will scroll from right to left</marquee>

<marquee direction="up">This text will scroll from bottom to top</marquee>

<marquee
  direction="down"
  width="250"
  height="200"
  behavior="alternate"
  class="outlined">
  <marquee behavior="alternate">This text will bounce</marquee>
</marquee>
```

# <menu>: The Menu element

The **`<menu>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is described in the HTML specification as a semantic alternative to {{HTMLElement("ul")}}, but treated by browsers (and exposed through the accessibility tree) as no different than {{HTMLElement("ul")}}. It represents an unordered list of items (which are represented by {{HTMLElement("li")}} elements).

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;menu&gt;", "tabbed-shorter")}}

```html interactive-example
<div class="news">
  <a href="#">NASA’s Webb Delivers Deepest Infrared Image of Universe Yet</a>
  <menu>
    <li><button id="save">Save for later</button></li>
    <li><button id="share">Share this news</button></li>
  </menu>
</div>
```

```css interactive-example
.news {
  background-color: bisque;
  padding: 1em;
  border: solid thin black;
}

menu {
  list-style-type: none;
  display: flex;
  padding: 0;
  margin-bottom: 0;
  gap: 1em;
}
```

## Attributes

This element also accepts the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

- `compact` {{Deprecated_inline}}
  - : This Boolean attribute hints that the list should be rendered in a compact style. The interpretation of this attribute is browser-specific. Use [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) instead: to give a similar effect as the `compact` attribute, the CSS property {{cssxref("line-height")}} can be used with a value of `80%`.

## Usage notes

The `<menu>` and {{HTMLElement("ul")}} elements both represent an unordered list of items. The key difference is that {{HTMLElement("ul")}} primarily contains items for display, while `<menu>` represents a toolbar containing commands that the user can perform or activate.

> [!NOTE]
> In early versions of the HTML specification, the `<menu>` element had an additional use case as a context menu. This functionality is considered obsolete and is not in the specification.

## Examples

### Toolbar

In this example, a `<menu>` is used to create a toolbar for an editing application.

#### HTML

```html
<menu>
  <li><button onclick="copy()">Copy</button></li>
  <li><button onclick="cut()">Cut</button></li>
  <li><button onclick="paste()">Paste</button></li>
</menu>
```

Note that this is functionally no different from:

```html
<ul>
  <li><button onclick="copy()">Copy</button></li>
  <li><button onclick="cut()">Cut</button></li>
  <li><button onclick="paste()">Paste</button></li>
</ul>
```

#### CSS

```css
menu,
ul {
  display: flex;
  list-style: none;
  padding: 0;
  width: 400px;
}

li {
  flex-grow: 1;
}

button {
  width: 100%;
}
```

# <meta> http-equiv attribute

The **`http-equiv`** attribute of the {{htmlelement("meta")}} element allows you to provide processing instructions for the browser as if the response that returned the document included certain HTTP headers.
The metadata is _document-level metadata_ that applies to the whole page.

When a `<meta>` element has an `http-equiv` attribute, a [`content`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/content) attribute defines the corresponding `http-equiv` value.
For example, the following `<meta>` tag tells the browser to refresh the page after 5 minutes:

```html
<meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="300" />
```

## Value

Only a subset of the HTTP headers are supported as `http-equiv` values.
These include:

- `content-language` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : Sets a default language for the document used by assistive technologies or styling by the browser.
    Similar to the {{httpheader("Content-Language")}} HTTP header.
    Use the [`lang`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/lang) attribute instead.
- `content-type`
  - : Declares the document's [media type (MIME type)](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/MIME_types) and character encoding.
    The `content` attribute must be `"text/html; charset=utf-8"` if specified.
    This is equivalent to a `<meta>` element with the [`charset`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta#charset) attribute specified and carries the same restriction on placement within the document.
    Can only be used in documents served with a `text/html` media type — not in documents served with an XML (`application/xml` or `application/xhtml+xml`) type.
    See the {{httpheader("Content-Type")}} HTTP header.
- `content-security-policy`
  - : Allows page authors to define a content security policy (CSP) for the current page, typically to specify allowed origins and script endpoints to guard against cross-site scripting attacks.
    See the {{httpheader("Content-Security-Policy")}} HTTP header.
- `default-style`
  - : Sets the name of the default [CSS style sheet](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) set.
- `refresh`
  - : Equivalent to the {{httpheader("Refresh")}} HTTP header.
    This instruction specifies:
    - The number of seconds until the page should be reloaded if the `content` attribute is a non-negative integer.
    - The number of seconds until the page should redirect to another URL if the `content` attribute is a non-negative integer followed by `;url=` and a valid URL.

    The timer starts when the page is _completely loaded_, which is after the {{domxref("Window/load_event", "load")}} and {{domxref("Window/pageshow_event", "pageshow")}} events have both fired.
    See [Accessibility concerns](#accessibility_concerns) for more information.

- `set-cookie` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : Sets a cookie for the document.
    Browsers now ignore this pragma; use the {{httpheader("Set-Cookie")}} HTTP response header or [`document.cookie`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/cookie) instead.
- `x-ua-compatible` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : Used by legacy versions of the now-retired {{glossary("Microsoft Internet Explorer")}} so that it more closely followed specified behavior.
    If specified, the `content` attribute must have the value `"IE=edge"`.
    User agents now ignore this pragma.
    The name derives from the `X-UA-Compatible` HTTP header.

> [!WARNING]
> Some browsers process additional headers that are not listed above.
> Since unrecognized headers or invalid values are ignored, this can lead to inconsistent behavior across browser implementations.
> In particular, **Do not set other security headers** using `<meta http-equiv=`, as this can lead to a false sense of security!

## Accessibility concerns

Pages set with a `http-equiv="Refresh"` value run the risk of having the refresh interval being too short.
People navigating with the aid of assistive technology such as a screen reader may be unable to read through and understand the page's content before being automatically redirected.
Abrupt, unannounced page updates may also be disorienting for people experiencing low vision conditions.

## Examples

### Disable unsafe inline code and only allow HTTPS resources

This HTML `<meta>` element sets the default CSP to only allow resource loading (images, fonts, scripts, etc.) over HTTPS.
Because the `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` directives are not set, inline scripts will be blocked:

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src https:" />
```

The same restrictions can be applied using the HTTP {{httpheader("Content-Security-Policy")}} header:

```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src https:
```

### Setting a page redirect

The following example uses `http-equiv="refresh"` to direct the browser to perform a redirect.
The `content="3;url=https://www.mozilla.org"` attribute will redirect page to `https://www.mozilla.org` after 3 seconds:

```html
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="3;url=https://www.mozilla.org" />
```

# <meta>: The metadata element

The **`<meta>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents {{Glossary("Metadata","metadata")}} that cannot be represented by other meta-related elements, such as {{HTMLElement("base")}}, {{HTMLElement("link")}}, {{HTMLElement("script")}}, {{HTMLElement("style")}}, or {{HTMLElement("title")}}.

The type of metadata provided by the `<meta>` element can be one of the following:

- If the [`name`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/name) attribute is set, the `<meta>` element provides _document-level metadata_ that applies to the whole page.
- If the [`http-equiv`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/http-equiv) attribute is set, the `<meta>` element acts as a _pragma directive_ to simulate directives that could otherwise be given by an HTTP header.
- If the [`charset`](#charset) attribute is set, the `<meta>` element is a _charset declaration_, giving the character encoding in which the document is encoded.
- If the [`itemprop`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/itemprop) attribute is set, the `<meta>` element provides _user-defined metadata_.

## Attributes

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

> [!NOTE]
> The [`name`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/name) attribute has a specific meaning for the `<meta>` element.
> The [`itemprop`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/itemprop) attribute must not be set on a `<meta>` element that includes a [`name`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/name), [`http-equiv`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/http-equiv), or [`charset`](#charset) attribute.

- `charset`
  - : This attribute declares the document's character encoding. If the attribute is present, its value must be an ASCII case-insensitive match for the string `"utf-8"`, because UTF-8 is the only valid encoding for HTML5 documents. `<meta>` elements which declare a character encoding must be located entirely within the first 1024 bytes of the document.
- [`content`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/content)
  - : This attribute contains the value for the [`http-equiv`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/http-equiv) or [`name`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/name) attribute, depending on which is used.
- [`http-equiv`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/http-equiv)
  - : Defines a pragma directive, which are instructions for the browser for processing the document.
    The attribute's name is short for `http-equivalent` because the allowed values are names of equivalent HTTP headers.
- `media`
  - : The `media` attribute defines which media the theme color defined in the `content` attribute should be applied to.
    Its value is a [media query](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries), which defaults to `all` if the attribute is missing.
    This attribute is only relevant when the element's [`name`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/name) attribute is set to [`theme-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/name/theme-color).
    Otherwise, it has no effect, and should not be included.
- [`name`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/name)
  - : The `name` and `content` attributes can be used together to provide document metadata in terms of name-value pairs, with the `name` attribute giving the metadata name, and the `content` attribute giving the value.

## Examples

### Setting a meta description

The following `<meta>` tag provides a `description` as metadata for the web page:

```html
<meta
  name="description"
  content="The HTML reference describes all elements and attributes of HTML, including global attributes that apply to all elements." />
```

### Setting a page redirect

The following example uses `http-equiv="refresh"` to direct the browser to perform a redirect.
The `content="3;url=https://www.mozilla.org"` attribute will redirect page to `https://www.mozilla.org` after 3 seconds:

```html
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="3;url=https://www.mozilla.org" />
```

# <meta name="color-scheme">

The **`color-scheme`** value for the [`name`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/name) attribute of the {{htmlelement("meta")}} element indicates a suggested color scheme that user agents should use for a page.
If specified, you define the color scheme using a [`content`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta#content) attribute in the `<meta>` element with a valid CSS {{cssxref("color-scheme")}} value.

The theme color works at the _document level_ in the same way that the CSS {{cssxref("color-scheme")}} property specifies the preferred and accepted color schemes of _individual elements_.
The primary use for `<meta name="color-scheme">` is to indicate compatibility and order of preference for light and dark color modes.
For example, to indicate that a document prefers dark mode but also supports light mode:

```html
<meta name="color-scheme" content="dark light" />
```

Your styles can adapt to the current color scheme using the {{cssxref("@media/prefers-color-scheme", "prefers-color-scheme")}} CSS media feature.

## Usage notes

A `<meta name="color-scheme">` element has the following additional attributes:

- [`content`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta#content)
  - : A `<meta>` element with `name=color-scheme` must have a `content` attribute that defines the color scheme as a CSS {{cssxref("color-scheme")}} value.
    The `content` attribute may be one of the following:
    - `normal`
      - : The document is unaware of color schemes and should be rendered using the default color palette.
    - `light`, `dark`, `light dark`, `dark light`
      - : One or more color schemes supported by the document.
        Multiple color schemes indicates that the first scheme is preferred by the document, but that the second scheme is acceptable if the user prefers it.
        Specifying the same color scheme multiple times has the same effect as specifying it once.
    - `only light`
      - : Indicates that the document _only_ supports light mode, with a light background and dark foreground colors.
        `only dark` _is invalid_, because forcing a document to render in dark mode when it isn't compatible can result in unreadable content and all major browsers default to light mode if not otherwise configured.
- `media` {{optional_inline}}
  - : Any valid media type or query.
    If provided, the options for the document's color scheme defined in the `content` attribute are suggested to the browser when the media query matches.
    This is mostly useful for the {{cssxref("@media/prefers-color-scheme", "prefers-color-scheme")}} CSS media feature.

## Examples

### Using a color-scheme keyword

The following example indicates to the browser that the page supports both light and dark themes.
Whether the light or dark color scheme is used depends on user preferences such as OS-level settings or the browser settings:

```html
<meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark" />
```

# <meta> name attribute

The **`name`** attribute of the {{htmlelement("meta")}} element provides metadata in name-value pairs.
When a `<meta>` element has a `name` attribute, a [`content`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/content) attribute defines the corresponding value.
The metadata is _document-level metadata_ that applies to the whole page.

For example, the following `<meta>` tag provides a `description` as metadata for a document:

```html
<meta
  name="description"
  content="The HTML reference describes all elements and attributes of HTML, including global attributes that apply to all elements." />
```

## Value

### Meta names defined in the HTML specification

The HTML specification defines the following set of standard metadata names:

- `application-name`
  - : Browsers may use this to identify the application running in the web page.
    It is different from the {{HTMLElement("title")}} element, which may contain an application (or website) name, but a `<title>` may add contextual information like a document name or a status.
    Individual pages shouldn't define their own, unique `application-name`.
    To provide translations, use multiple `<meta>` tags with the `lang` attribute for each language:

    ```html
    <meta name="application-name" content="Weather Wizard" lang="en" />
    <meta name="application-name" content="Mago del Clima" lang="es" />
    ```

- `author`
  - : The document author's name.
- [`color-scheme`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/name/color-scheme)
  - : Specifies one or more color schemes with which the document is compatible.
    The browser will use this information in tandem with the user's browser or device settings to determine what colors to use for everything from background and foregrounds to form controls and scrollbars.
    The primary use for `<meta name="color-scheme">` is to indicate compatibility and order of preference for light and dark color modes.
- `description`
  - : A short and accurate summary of the content of the page usually referred to as a "meta description".
    Search engines like Google use this metadata to adjust [the appearance of a webpage in search](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/snippet#meta-descriptions) results.
- `generator`
  - : The identifier of the software that generated the page.
- `keywords`
  - : Words relevant to the page's content separated by commas.
- [`referrer`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/name/referrer)
  - : Controls the HTTP {{httpheader("Referer")}} header of requests sent from the document.
- [`theme-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/name/theme-color)
  - : Indicates a suggested color that user agents should use to customize the display of the page or of the surrounding user interface.
    The [`content`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/content) attribute contains a valid CSS {{cssxref("&lt;color&gt;")}}.
    The [`media`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta#media) attribute with a valid media query list can be included to set the media that the theme color metadata applies to.

### Meta names defined in other specifications

The CSS Device Adaptation specification defines the following metadata name:

- [`viewport`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/name/viewport)
  - : Gives hints about the size of the initial size of the {{glossary("viewport")}}.

### Meta names defined in the WHATWG MetaExtensions wiki

The [WHATWG Wiki MetaExtensions page](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/MetaExtensions) contains a large set of non-standard metadata names.
Some of the names included are used quite commonly in practice, notably the following:

- `creator`
  - : The name of the creator of the document, such as an organization or institution.
    If there are more than one, several {{HTMLElement("meta")}} elements should be used.
- `googlebot`
  - : A synonym of `robots`, is only followed by Googlebot (the indexing crawler for Google).
- `publisher`
  - : The document publisher's name.
- [`robots`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/name/robots)
  - : A comma-separated list of values defining the crawl behavior that cooperative crawlers (or "robots") should use with the page.

# <meta name="referrer">

The **`referrer`** value for the [`name`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/name) attribute of the {{htmlelement("meta")}} element controls the HTTP {{httpheader("Referer")}} header of requests sent from the document.
If specified, you define the referrer using a [`content`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta#content) attribute in the `<meta>` element as a keyword value.

For example, the following `<meta>` element sends the {{glossary("origin")}} of the document as the referrer:

```html
<meta name="referrer" content="origin" />
```

> [!WARNING]
> Dynamically inserting `<meta name="referrer">` (with {{domxref("Document.write", "document.write()")}} or {{domxref("Node.appendChild", "appendChild()")}}) makes the referrer behavior unpredictable.
> When several conflicting policies are defined, the `no-referrer` policy is applied.

## Usage notes

A `<meta name="referrer">` element has the following additional attributes:

- [`content`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta#content)
  - : Sets the document referrer. You must define this attribute.
    Accepts one of the following values:
    - `no-referrer`
      - : Does not send an HTTP `Referer` header.
    - `origin`
      - : Sends the origin of the document.
    - `no-referrer-when-downgrade`
      - : Sends the full URL when the destination is at least as secure as the current page (HTTP(S)→HTTPS), but sends no referrer when it's less secure (HTTPS→HTTP). This is the default behavior.
    - `origin-when-cross-origin`
      - : Sends the full URL (stripped of parameters) for same-origin requests, but only sends the origin for other cases.
    - `same-origin`
      - : Sends the full URL (stripped of parameters) for same-origin requests. Cross-origin requests will contain no referrer header.
    - `strict-origin`
      - : Sends the origin when the destination is at least as secure as the current page (HTTP(S)→HTTPS), but sends no referrer when it's less secure (HTTPS→HTTP).
    - `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
      - : Sends the full URL (stripped of parameters) for same-origin requests. Sends the origin when the destination is at least as secure as the current page (HTTP(S)→HTTPS). Otherwise, sends no referrer.
    - `unsafe-URL`
      - : Sends the full URL (stripped of parameters) for same-origin or cross-origin requests.

## Examples

### Removing a referrer from requests

# <meta name="robots">

The **`robots`** value for the [`name`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/name) attribute of the {{htmlelement("meta")}} element (often called a "robots tag") defines the crawl and indexing behavior that web {{glossary("Crawler", "crawlers")}} should use with the page.
If specified, you define instructions for crawlers in the [`content`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta#content) attribute of the `<meta>` element as a comma-separated list of one or more rules.

For example, to hint to crawlers that a page should be excluded from their search indexes, a `noindex` value can be used:

```html
<meta name="robots" content="noindex" />
```

> [!NOTE]
> Only cooperative robots follow these rules.
> A crawler still needs to access the resource to read headers and meta elements (see [X-Robots-Tag: Interaction with robots.txt](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/X-Robots-Tag#interaction_with_robots.txt)).
> If you want to prevent bandwidth consumption by crawlers, a restrictive {{Glossary("robots.txt")}} file is more effective than indexing rules as it blocks resources from being crawled entirely.

## Usage notes

A `<meta name="robots">` element can have the following additional attributes:

- [`content`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta#content)
  - : The `content` attribute must be defined, and its value sets indexing and crawling behavior for cooperative search engine robots.
    Accepts one or more of the following keywords as a comma-separated list:

## Description

There are several important considerations to note when setting a `robots` meta value:

- Only cooperative robots follow these rules. They won't prevent malicious actors like email harvesters from ignoring the directives.
- If defined in a `<meta>` tag, robots still need to access the page to read these rules. To reduce bandwidth, consider using a [robots.txt file](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Practical_implementation_guides/Robots_txt) instead.
- The `<meta name="robots">` tag and `robots.txt` serve different roles: `robots.txt` controls crawling, while the `robots` meta tag influences indexing and other behavior.
- A page blocked by `robots.txt` may still be indexed if linked from other sources.
- The `noindex` directive will only take effect after the robot revisits the page, so ensure `robots.txt` doesn't prevent this.
- Some values, such as `index` vs. `noindex` or `follow` vs. `nofollow`, are mutually exclusive. Behavior is undefined when conflicting values are used.
- Robots like Google, Yahoo, and Bing also support these directives in the HTTP header {{HTTPHeader("X-Robots-Tag")}}, which is useful for non-HTML content such as PDFs or images.

## Examples

### Using a robots keyword

The following example uses `nofollow` to request that a crawler doesn't follow links on a page and `noindex` to request that the page is excluded from indexing:

```html
<meta name="robots" content="nofollow, noindex" />
```

## Specifications

While not part of any specification, it is a de-facto standard method for communicating with search bots, web crawlers, and similar user agents.

## Browser compatibility

This feature is intended for crawlers to observe, so "browser" compatibility doesn't apply.

# <meta name="theme-color">

The **`theme-color`** value for the [`name`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/name) attribute of the {{htmlelement("meta")}} element indicates a suggested color that user agents should use to customize the display of the page or of the surrounding user interface.
If specified, you define a theme color using a [`content`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta#content) attribute in the `<meta>` element as a CSS {{cssxref("&lt;color&gt;")}} value.

For example, to indicate that a document should use `cornflowerblue` as a theme color, set the `<meta>` as:

```html
<meta name="theme-color" content="cornflowerblue" />
```

To set the media to which the theme color metadata applies, include the [`media`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta#media) attribute with a valid media query list (see the [`theme-color` media query example](#using_a_media_query_with_theme-color)).

## Usage notes

A `<meta name="theme-color">` element has the following additional attributes:

- [`content`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta#content)
  - : A `<meta>` element with `name=theme-color` must have a `content` attribute that defines the theme color.
    The value of `content` attribute is as follows:
    - {{cssxref("&lt;color&gt;")}} value
      - : A valid color value, such as hexadecimal, RGB, named color, etc.
- `media` {{optional_inline}}
  - : Any valid media type or query.
    If provided, the options for the document's theme color defined in the `content` attribute are suggested to the browser when the media query matches.

## Examples

### Setting a color value

Consider the following code that uses `<meta>` to set a theme color:

```html
<meta name="theme-color" content="#4285f4" />
```

The following image shows the effect of this setting in Chrome on an Android mobile device:

### Using a media query with `theme-color`

You can provide a media type or query inside the [`media`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta#media) attribute.
The `theme-color` will then only be set if the media condition is true.
For example:

```html
<meta
  name="theme-color"
  content="cornflowerblue"
  media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" />
<meta
  name="theme-color"
  content="dimgray"
  media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" />
```

# <meta name="viewport">

The **`viewport`** value for the [`name`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/name) attribute of a {{htmlelement("meta")}} element gives hints about how the {{glossary("viewport")}} should be sized.

If specified, you define viewport-related behaviors using a [`content`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta#content) attribute in the `<meta>` element as a comma-separated list of one or more values.

## Usage notes

A `<meta name="viewport">` element has the following additional attributes:

- [`content`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta#content)
  - : The `content` attribute must be defined, and its value sets various viewport-related behaviors.
    Its value is a comma-separated list of one or more key-value pairs specified as `key=value`. The following keys are defined:
    - `width`
      - : Controls the (minimum) pixel width of the viewport (see [viewport width and screen width](#viewport_width_and_screen_width)). It can be set to a positive whole number of pixels between 1 and 10000 (like `width=600`) or to the special value `device-width`, which is the physical size of the device screen in CSS pixels. This value establishes the value of the [`vw`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#relative_length_units_based_on_viewport) unit.
    - `height`
      - : Controls the (minimum) pixel height of the viewport (see [viewport width and screen width](#viewport_width_and_screen_width)). It can be set to a positive whole number of pixels between 1 and 10000 (like `height=400`) or to the special value `device-height`, which is the physical size of the device screen in CSS pixels. This value establishes the value of the [`vh`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#relative_length_units_based_on_viewport) unit.
    - `initial-scale`
      - : Defines the ratio between the device width (`device-width` in portrait mode or `device-height` in landscape mode) and the viewport size.
        It can be a number between `0.0` and `10.0`.
    - `maximum-scale`
      - : Defines the maximum amount to zoom in.
        It must be greater or equal to the `minimum-scale` or the behavior is undefined.
        Browser settings can ignore this rule, and iOS10+ ignores it by default.
        It can be a number between `0.0` and `10.0`.
    - `minimum-scale`
      - : Defines the minimum zoom level.
        It must be smaller or equal to the `maximum-scale` or the behavior is undefined.
        Browser settings can ignore this rule, and iOS10+ ignores it by default.
        It can be a number between `0.0` and `10.0`.
    - `user-scalable`
      - : A boolean indicating if the user can zoom the web page.
        Browser settings can ignore this rule, and iOS10+ ignores it by default.
        It can be either `yes` or `no`, defaulting to `yes`.
        > [!WARNING]
        > Disabling zooming capabilities by setting `user-scalable` to a value of `no` prevents people experiencing low vision conditions from being able to read and understand page content. Additionally, WCAG requires a minimum of 2× scaling; however, the best practice is to enable a 5× zoom. For more information, see:

        > - [Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.4 | W3C Understanding WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-scale.html)
    - `interactive-widget`
      - : Specifies the effect that interactive UI widgets, such as virtual keyboards, have on a page's viewport.
        It can be the keyword `resizes-visual`, `resizes-content`, or `overlays-content`.
        - `resizes-visual`: The {{Glossary("visual viewport")}} gets resized by the interactive widget. This is the default.
        - `resizes-content`: The {{Glossary("viewport")}} gets resized by the interactive widget.
        - `overlays-content`: Neither the viewport nor the visual viewport gets resized by the interactive widget.

        When the {{Glossary("viewport")}} gets resized, the initial [containing block](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Containing_block) also gets resized, thereby affecting the computed size of [viewport units](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#relative_length_units_based_on_viewport).

    - `viewport-fit`
      - : Defines the viewable portions of the web page.
        It can be one of the keywords `auto`, `contain`, or `cover`.
        - `auto`: Doesn't affect the initial layout viewport, and the whole web page is viewable.
        - `contain`: The viewport is scaled to fit the largest rectangle inscribed within the display.
        - `cover`: The viewport is scaled to fill the device display.
          It's highly recommended to use the [safe area inset](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/env) variables to ensure that important content doesn't end up outside the display.

### Viewport width and screen width

The browser's {{glossary("viewport")}} is the area of the window in which web content can be seen. The viewport size needs to be computed before the page's content can be laid out—the page can overflow the viewport, in which case the browser provides scrollbars for the user to scroll around and access all the content, but the viewport size is the guideline for how much space, especially horizontally, the content should fit into.

Some mobile devices and other narrow screens render pages in a virtual window or viewport that is wider than the screen, and then shrink the rendered result down to fit the screen size. Users can then zoom and pan to look more closely at different areas of the page. For example, if a mobile screen has a width of 640px, pages might be rendered with a virtual viewport of 980px, and then it will be shrunk down to fit into the 640px space. This is done because not all pages are optimized for mobile and break (or at least look bad) when rendered at a small viewport width. This virtual viewport is a way to make non-mobile-optimized sites in general look better on narrow screen devices. However, this mechanism is not so good for pages that are optimized for narrow screens using [media queries](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries) — if the virtual viewport is 980px for example, media queries that kick in at 640px or 480px or less will never be used, limiting the effectiveness of such responsive design techniques. The viewport `<meta>` element mitigates this problem of virtual viewport on narrow screen devices.

The most common setting is the following, which sets the viewport to match the device's width and displays content at 100% zoom:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
```

Sites can set their viewport to a specific size. For example, the definition `"width=320, initial-scale=1"` can be used to fit precisely onto a small phone display in portrait mode. This can cause problems when the browser renders a page at a larger size. To fix this, browsers will expand the viewport width if necessary to fill the screen at the requested scale. This is especially useful on large-screen devices.

For pages that set an initial or maximum scale, this means the `width` property actually translates into a _minimum_ viewport width. For example, if your layout needs at least 500 pixels of width then you can use the following markup. When the screen is more than 500 pixels wide, the browser will expand the viewport (rather than zoom in) to fit the screen:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=500, initial-scale=1" />
```

### Screen density

Screen resolutions have risen to the size that individual pixels are indistinguishable by the human eye. For example, smartphones often have small screens with resolutions upwards of 1920–1080 pixels (≈400dpi). Because of this, many browsers can display their pages in a smaller physical size by translating multiple hardware pixels for each CSS "pixel". Initially, this caused usability and readability problems on many touch-optimized websites.

On high dpi screens, pages with `initial-scale=1` will effectively be zoomed by browsers. Their text will be smooth and crisp, but their bitmap images may not take advantage of the full screen resolution. To get sharper images on these screens, web developers may want to design images – or whole layouts – at a higher scale than their final size and then scale them down using CSS or viewport properties.

The default pixel ratio depends on the display density. On a display with density less than 200dpi, the ratio is 1.0. On displays with density between 200 and 300dpi, the ratio is 1.5. For displays with density over 300dpi, the ratio is the integer floor (_density_/150dpi). Note that the default ratio is true only when the viewport scale equals 1. Otherwise, the relationship between CSS pixels and {{glossary("device pixel", "device pixels")}} depends on the current zoom level.

### Using a meta viewport size

The following example indicates to the browser that the page should be rendered at the device width:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
```

### Using a media query with a viewport meta

The following `content` value uses multiple keywords that hint to the browser to use fullscreen mode, along with `viewport-fit`, which helps avoid display cutouts such as mobile device notches:

```html
<meta
  name="viewport"
  content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, viewport-fit=cover" />
```

### The effect of interactive UI widgets

Interactive UI widgets of the browser can influence the size of the page's viewports. The most common such UI widget is a virtual keyboard. To control which resize behavior the browser should use, set the `interactive-widget` property.

By default, the virtual keyboard only resizes the visual viewport, which doesn't affect the layout of the page. You can make the page's layout adapt to the presence of the virtual keyboard by setting the `interactive-widget` property to `resizes-content`:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="interactive-widget=resizes-content" />
```

# <meter>: The HTML Meter element

The **`<meter>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents either a scalar value within a known range or a fractional value.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;meter&gt;", "tabbed-shorter")}}

```html interactive-example
<label for="fuel">Fuel level:</label>

<meter id="fuel" min="0" max="100" low="33" high="66" optimum="80" value="50">
  at 50/100
</meter>
```

```css interactive-example
label {
  padding-right: 10px;
  font-size: 1rem;
}
```

## Attributes

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

- `value`
  - : The current numeric value. This must be between the minimum and maximum values (`min` attribute and `max` attribute) if they are specified. If unspecified or malformed, the value is `0`. If specified, but not within the range given by the `min` attribute and `max` attribute, the value is equal to the nearest end of the range.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Unless the `value` attribute is between `0` and `1` (inclusive), the `min` and `max` attributes should define the range so that the `value` attribute's value is within it.

- [`min`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/min)
  - : The lower numeric bound of the measured range. This must be less than the maximum value (`max` attribute), if specified. If unspecified, the minimum value is `0`.
- [`max`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/max)
  - : The upper numeric bound of the measured range. This must be greater than the minimum value (`min` attribute), if specified. If unspecified, the maximum value is `1`.
- `low`
  - : The upper numeric bound of the low end of the measured range. This must be greater than the minimum value (`min` attribute), and it also must be less than the high value and maximum value (`high` attribute and `max` attribute, respectively), if any are specified. If unspecified, or if less than the minimum value, the `low` value is equal to the minimum value.
- `high`
  - : The lower numeric bound of the high end of the measured range. This must be less than the maximum value (`max` attribute), and it also must be greater than the low value and minimum value (`low` attribute and `min` attribute, respectively), if any are specified. If unspecified, or if greater than the maximum value, the `high` value is equal to the maximum value.
- `optimum`
  - : This attribute indicates the optimal numeric value. It must be within the range (as defined by the `min` attribute and `max` attribute). When used with the `low` attribute and `high` attribute, it gives an indication where along the range is considered preferable. For example, if it is between the `min` attribute and the `low` attribute, then the lower range is considered preferred. The browser may color the meter's bar differently depending on whether the value is less than or equal to the optimum value.

## Examples

### Basic Example

#### HTML

```html
<p>Battery level: <meter min="0" max="100" value="75">75%</meter></p>
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Basic_example", 300, 60)}}

### High and low range example

Note that in this example the [`min`](#min) attribute is omitted. This is allowed, as it will default to `0`.

#### HTML

```html
<p>
  Student's exam score:
  <meter min="0" low="50" high="80" max="100" value="84">84%</meter>
</p>
```

# <nav>: The Navigation Section element

The **`<nav>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;nav&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<nav class="crumbs">
  <ol>
    <li class="crumb"><a href="#">Bikes</a></li>
    <li class="crumb"><a href="#">BMX</a></li>
    <li class="crumb">Jump Bike 3000</li>
  </ol>
</nav>

<h1>Jump Bike 3000</h1>
<p>
  This BMX bike is a solid step into the pro world. It looks as legit as it
  rides and is built to polish your skills.

## Attributes

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

## Usage notes

- It's not necessary for all links to be contained in a `<nav>` element. `<nav>` is intended only for a major block of navigation links; typically the {{HTMLElement("footer")}} element often has a list of links that don't need to be in a `<nav>` element.
- A document may have several `<nav>` elements, for example, one for site navigation and one for intra-page navigation. [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) can be used in such case to promote accessibility, see [example](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/Heading_Elements#labeling_section_content).
- User agents, such as screen readers targeting disabled users, can use this element to determine whether to omit the initial rendering of navigation-only content.

## Examples

In this example, a `<nav>` block is used to contain an unordered list ({{HTMLElement("ul")}}) of links. With appropriate CSS, this can be presented as a sidebar, navigation bar, or drop-down menu.

```html live-sample___unordered-list
<nav class="menu">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('unordered-list')}}

The semantics of the `nav` element is that of providing links. However a `nav` element doesn't have to contain a list, it can contain other kinds of content as well. In this navigation block, links are provided in prose:

```html live-sample___prose
<nav>
  <h2>Navigation</h2>
  <p>
    You are on my home page. To the north lies <a href="/blog">my blog</a>, from
    whence the sounds of battle can be heard. To the east you can see a large
    mountain, upon which many <a href="/school">school papers</a> are littered.
    Far up this mountain you can spy a little figure who appears to be me,
    desperately scribbling a <a href="/school/thesis">thesis</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To the west are several exits. One fun-looking exit is labeled
    <a href="https://games.example.com/">"games"</a>. Another more
    boring-looking exit is labeled <a href="https://isp.example.net/">ISP™</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To the south lies a dark and dank <a href="/about">contacts page</a>.
    Cobwebs cover its disused entrance, and at one point you see a rat run
    quickly out of the page.
  </p>
</nav>
```

# <nobr>: The Non-Breaking Text element

{{deprecated_header}}

The **`<nobr>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element prevents the text it contains from automatically wrapping across multiple lines, potentially resulting in the user having to scroll horizontally to see the entire width of the text.

> [!WARNING]
> Although this element is widely supported, it was _never_ standard HTML, so you shouldn't use it. Instead, use the CSS property {{CSSxRef("white-space")}} like this:

# <noembed>: The Embed Fallback element

{{deprecated_header}}

The **`<noembed>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is an obsolete, non-standard way to provide alternative, or "fallback", content for browsers that do not support the {{HTMLElement("embed")}} element or do not support the type of [embedded content](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Content_categories#embedded_content) an author wishes to use. This element was deprecated in HTML 4.01 and above in favor of placing fallback content between the opening and closing tags of an {{HTMLElement("object")}} element.

> [!NOTE]
> While this element currently still works in many browsers, it is obsolete and should not be used. Use {{HTMLElement("object")}} instead, with fallback content between the opening and closing tags of the element.

## Examples

The message inside `<noembed>` tag will appear only when your browser does not support `<embed>` tag.

### Show an alternative content

```html
<embed
  type="vide/webm"

# <noframes>: The Frame Fallback element

{{deprecated_header}}

The **`<noframes>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element provides content to be presented in browsers that don't support (or have disabled support for) the {{HTMLElement("frame")}} element. Although most commonly-used browsers support frames, there are exceptions, including certain special-use browsers including some mobile browsers, as well as text-mode browsers.

A `<noframes>` element can contain any HTML elements that are allowed within the body of an HTML document, except for the {{HTMLElement("frameset")}} and {{HTMLElement("frame")}} elements, since using frames when they aren't supported doesn't make sense.

`<noframes>` can be used to present a message explaining that the user's browser doesn't support frames, but ideally should be used to present an alternate form of the site that doesn't use frames but still offers the same or similar functionality.

> [!NOTE]
> This element is obsolete and shouldn't be used, since the {{HTMLElement("frame")}} and {{HTMLElement("frameset")}} elements are also obsolete. When frames are needed at all, they should be presented using the {{HTMLElement("iframe")}} element.

## Attributes

Like all other HTML elements, this element supports the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes). It has no other attributes available.

## Example

In this example, we see a frameset with two frames. In addition, `<noframes>` is used to present an explanatory message if the {{Glossary("user agent")}} doesn't support frames.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <!-- Document metadata goes here -->
  </head>
  <frameset rows="45%, 55%">
    <frame src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/frameset" />
    <frame src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/frame" />
    <noframes>
      <p>
        It seems your browser does not support frames or is configured to not
        allow them.
      </p>
    </noframes>
  </frameset>

# <noscript>: The Noscript element

The **`<noscript>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element defines a section of HTML to be inserted if a script type on the page is unsupported or if scripting is currently turned off in the browser.

## Attributes

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

## Examples

```html
<noscript>
  <!-- anchor linking to external file -->
  <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">External Link</a>
</noscript>
<p>Rocks!</p>
```

### Result with scripting enabled

Rocks!

### Result with scripting disabled

[External Link](https://www.mozilla.org/)

Rocks!

## Usage notes

The `<noscript>` element represents its children differently depending on if scripting is enabled:

- If scripting is disabled the `<noscript>` element represents its children as [HTML content](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement).
- If scripting is enabled, the `<noscript>` element represents its children as [text](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Text).

# <object>: The External Object element

The **`<object>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents an external resource, which can be treated as an image, a nested browsing context, or a resource to be handled by a plugin.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;object&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<object
  type="video/mp4"
  data="/shared-assets/videos/flower.mp4"
  width="250"
  height="200"></object>
```

## Attributes

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

- `archive` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : A space-separated list of URIs for archives of resources for the object.
- `border` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : The width of a border around the control, in pixels.
- `classid` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : The URI of the object's implementation. It can be used together with, or in place of, the **data** attribute.
- `codebase` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : The base path used to resolve relative URIs specified by **classid**, **data**, or **archive**. If not specified, the default is the base URI of the current document.
- `codetype` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : The content type of the data specified by **classid**.
- `data`
  - : The address of the resource as a valid URL. At least one of **data** and **type** must be defined.
- `declare` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : The presence of this Boolean attribute makes this element a declaration only. The object must be instantiated by a subsequent `<object>` element. Repeat the `<object>` element completely each time the resource is reused.
- [`form`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/form)
  - : The form element, if any, that the object element is associated with (its _form owner_). The value of the attribute must be an ID of a {{HTMLElement("form")}} element in the same document.
- `height`
  - : The height of the displayed resource, as in {{cssxref("&lt;integer&gt;")}} in {{glossary("CSS pixel", "CSS pixels")}}.
- `name`
  - : The name of valid browsing context (HTML5), or the name of the control (HTML 4). The name becomes a property of the {{domxref("Window")}} and {{domxref("Document")}} objects, containing a reference to the embedded window or the element itself.
- `standby` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : A message that the browser can show while loading the object's implementation and data.
- `type`
  - : The [content type](/en-US/docs/Glossary/MIME_type) of the resource specified by **data**. At least one of **data** and **type** must be defined.
- `usemap` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : A hash-name reference to a {{HTMLElement("map")}} element; that is a '#' followed by the value of a [`name`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/map#name) of a map element.
- `width`
  - : The width of the display resource, as in {{cssxref("&lt;integer&gt;")}} in {{glossary("CSS pixel", "CSS pixels")}}.

## Examples

### Embed a video

#### HTML

```html
<object
  type="video/webm"
  data="/shared-assets/videos/flower.webm"
  width="600"
  height="140">
  <img
    src="/shared-assets/images/examples/flowers.jpg"
    alt="Some beautiful flowers" />
</object>
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Embed a video")}}

If the video in the example fails to load, the user will be provided with an image as fallback content. The {{HTMLElement("img")}} tag is used to display an image. We include the `src` attribute set to the path to the image we want to embed. We also include the `alt` attribute, which provides the image with an accessible name. If the image also fails to load, the content of the `alt` attribute will be displayed.

# <ol>: The Ordered List element

The **`<ol>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents an ordered list of items — typically rendered as a numbered list.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;ol&gt;", "tabbed-shorter")}}

```html interactive-example
<ol>
  <li>Mix flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt.</li>
  <li>In another bowl, mix eggs, milk, and oil.</li>
  <li>Stir both mixtures together.</li>
  <li>Fill muffin tray 3/4 full.</li>
  <li>Bake for 20 minutes.</li>
</ol>
```

```css interactive-example
li {
  font:
    1rem "Fira Sans",
    sans-serif;
  margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
}
```

## Attributes

This element also accepts the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

- `compact` {{Deprecated_inline}} {{non-standard_inline}}
  - : This Boolean attribute hints that the list should be rendered in a compact style. The interpretation of this attribute is browser-specific. Use [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) instead: to give a similar effect as the `compact` attribute, the CSS property {{cssxref("line-height")}} can be used with a value of `80%`.
- `reversed`
  - : This Boolean attribute specifies that the list's items are in reverse order. Items will be numbered from high to low.
- `start`
  - : An integer to start counting from for the list items. Always an Arabic numeral (1, 2, 3, etc.), even when the numbering `type` is letters or Roman numerals. For example, to start numbering elements from the letter "d" or the Roman numeral "iv," use `start="4"`.
- `type`
  - : Sets the numbering type:
    - `a` for lowercase letters
    - `A` for uppercase letters
    - `i` for lowercase Roman numerals
    - `I` for uppercase Roman numerals
    - `1` for numbers (default)

    The specified type is used for the entire list unless a different [`type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/li#type) attribute is used on an enclosed {{HTMLElement("li")}} element.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Unless the type of the list number matters (like legal or technical documents where items are referenced by their number/letter), use the CSS {{CSSxRef("list-style-type")}} property instead.

## Usage notes

Typically, ordered list items display with a preceding [marker](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::marker), such as a number or letter.

The `<ol>` and {{HTMLElement("ul")}} (or the synonym {{HTMLElement("menu")}}) elements may nest as deeply as desired, alternating between `<ol>`, `<ul>` (or `<menu>`) as needed.

The `<ol>` and {{HTMLElement("ul")}} elements both represent a list of items. The difference is with the `<ol>` element, the order is meaningful. For example:

- Steps in a recipe
- Turn-by-turn directions
- The list of ingredients in decreasing proportion on nutrition information labels

To determine which list to use, try changing the order of the list items; if the meaning changes, use the `<ol>` element — otherwise you can use {{HTMLElement("ul")}} otherwise, or {{HTMLElement("menu")}} if your list is a menu.

## Examples

### Basic example

```html
<ol>
  <li>Fee</li>
  <li>Fi</li>
  <li>Fo</li>
  <li>Fum</li>
</ol>
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Basic_example", 400, 100)}}

### Using Roman Numeral type

```html
<ol type="i">
  <li>Introduction</li>
  <li>List of Grievances</li>
  <li>Conclusion</li>
</ol>
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Using_Roman_Numeral_type", 400, 100)}}

### Using the start attribute

```html
<p>Finishing places of contestants not in the winners' circle:</p>

<ol start="4">
  <li>Speedwalk Stu</li>
  <li>Saunterin' Sam</li>
  <li>Slowpoke Rodriguez</li>
</ol>
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Using_the_start_attribute", 400, 100)}}

### Nesting lists

```html
<ol>
  <li>first item</li>
  <li>
    second item
    <!-- closing </li> tag is not here! -->
    <ol>
      <li>second item first subitem</li>
      <li>second item second subitem</li>
      <li>second item third subitem</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <!-- Here's the closing </li> tag -->
  <li>third item</li>
</ol>
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Nesting_lists", 400, 150)}}

### Unordered list inside ordered list

```html
<ol>
  <li>first item</li>
  <li>
    second item
    <!-- closing </li> tag is not here! -->
    <ul>
      <li>second item first subitem</li>

# <optgroup>: The Option Group element

The **`<optgroup>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element creates a grouping of options within a {{HTMLElement("select")}} element.

In [customizable `<select>` elements](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Customizable_select), the {{htmlelement("legend")}} element is allowed as a child of `<optgroup>`, to provide a label that is easy to target and style. This replaces any text set in the `<optgroup>` element's `label` attribute, and it has the same semantics.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;optgroup&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<label for="dino-select">Choose a dinosaur:</label>
<select id="dino-select">
  <optgroup label="Theropods">
    <option>Tyrannosaurus</option>
    <option>Velociraptor</option>

    <option>Saltasaurus</option>
    <option>Apatosaurus</option>
  </optgroup>
</select>
```

```css interactive-example

# <option>: The HTML Option element

The **`<option>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used to define an item contained in a {{HTMLElement("select")}}, an {{HTMLElement("optgroup")}}, or a {{HTMLElement("datalist")}} element. As such, `<option>` can represent menu items in popups and other lists of items in an HTML document.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;option&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<label for="pet-select">Choose a pet:</label>

<select id="pet-select">

  padding: 2px 5px;
}
```

## Attributes

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

- [`disabled`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/disabled)
  - : If this Boolean attribute is set, this option is not checkable. Often browsers grey out such control and it won't receive any browsing event, like mouse clicks or focus-related ones. If this attribute is not set, the element can still be disabled if one of its ancestors is a disabled {{HTMLElement("optgroup")}} element.
- `label`
  - : This attribute is text for the label indicating the meaning of the option. If the `label` attribute isn't defined, its value is that of the element text content.
- `selected`
  - : If present, this Boolean attribute indicates that the option is initially selected. If the `<option>` element is the descendant of a {{HTMLElement("select")}} element whose [`multiple`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/select#multiple) attribute is not set, only one single `<option>` of this {{HTMLElement("select")}} element may have the `selected` attribute.
- `value`
  - : The content of this attribute represents the value to be submitted with the form, should this option be selected. If this attribute is omitted, the value is taken from the text content of the option element.

## Styling with CSS

Styling `<option>` elements has historically been highly limited. [Customizable select elements](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Customizable_select) explains newer features that enable their full customization, just like any regular DOM element.

### Legacy option styling

In browsers that don't support the modern customization features (or legacy codebases where they can't be used), the styling available on `<option>` elements depends on the browser and operating system. Depending on the operating system, the [`font-size`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size) of the owning `<select>` is respected in Firefox and Chromium. Chromium may additionally allow [`color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color), [`background-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color), [`font-family`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family), [`font-variant`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-variant), and [`text-align`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align) to be set.

You can find more details about legacy `<option>` styling in [our guide to advanced form styling](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Advanced_form_styling).

## Examples

See {{HTMLElement("select")}} for examples.

# <output>: The Output element

The **`<output>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is a container element into which a site or app can inject the results of a calculation or the outcome of a user action.

## Attributes

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

- [`for`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/for)
  - : A space-separated list of other elements' [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/id)s, indicating that those elements contributed input values to (or otherwise affected) the calculation.
- [`form`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/form)
  - : The {{HTMLElement("form")}} element to associate the output with (its _form owner_). The value of this attribute must be the [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/id) of a `<form>` in the same document. (If this attribute is not set, the `<output>` is associated with its ancestor `<form>` element, if any.)

    This attribute lets you associate `<output>` elements to `<form>`s anywhere in the document, not just inside a `<form>`. It can also override an ancestor `<form>` element. The `<output>` element's name and content are not submitted when the form is submitted.

- `name`
  - : The element's name. Used in the {{domxref("HTMLFormElement.elements", "form.elements")}} API.

The `<output>` value, name, and contents are NOT submitted during form submission.

## Accessibility

Many browsers implement this element as an [`aria-live`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Guides/Live_regions) region. Assistive technology will thereby announce the results of UI interactions posted inside it without requiring that focus is switched away from the controls that produce those results.

## Examples

In the following example, the form provides a slider whose value can range between `0` and `100`, and an {{HTMLElement("input")}} element into which you can enter a second number. The two numbers are added together, and the result is displayed in the `<output>` element each time the value of any of the controls changes.

```html
<form id="example-form">
  <input type="range" id="b" name="b" value="50" /> +
  <input type="number" id="a" name="a" value="10" /> =
  <output name="result" for="a b">60</output>
</form>
```

```js
const form = document.getElementById("example-form");
const a = form.elements["a"];
const b = form.elements["b"];
const result = form.elements["result"];

function updateResult() {
  const aValue = a.valueAsNumber;
  const bValue = b.valueAsNumber;
  result.value = aValue + bValue;
}

form.addEventListener("input", updateResult);

updateResult();
```

# <p>: The Paragraph element

The **`<p>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.

Paragraphs are [block-level elements](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Block-level_content), and notably will automatically close if another block-level element is parsed before the closing `</p>` tag. See "Tag omission" below.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;p&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<p>
  Geckos are a group of usually small, usually nocturnal lizards. They are found
  on every continent except Antarctica.
</p>

<p>
  Some species live in houses where they hunt insects attracted by artificial
  light.
</p>
```

```css interactive-example
p {
  margin: 10px 0;
  padding: 5px;
  border: 1px solid #999999;
}
```

## Attributes

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

> [!NOTE]
> The `align` attribute on `<p>` tags is obsolete and shouldn't be used.

## Accessibility

Breaking up content into paragraphs helps make a page more accessible. Screen-readers and other assistive technology provide shortcuts to let their users skip to the next or previous paragraph, letting them skim content like how white space lets visual users skip around.

Using empty `<p>` elements to add space between paragraphs is problematic for people who navigate with screen-reading technology. Screen readers may announce the paragraph's presence, but not any content contained within it — because there is none. This can confuse and frustrate the person using the screen reader.

If extra space is desired, use {{glossary("CSS")}} properties like {{cssxref("margin")}} to create the effect:

```css
p {
  margin-bottom: 2em; /* increase white space after a paragraph */
}
```

## Examples

### HTML

```html
<p>
  This is the first paragraph of text. This is the first paragraph of text. This
  is the first paragraph of text. This is the first paragraph of text.
</p>
<p>
  This is the second paragraph. This is the second paragraph. This is the second
  paragraph. This is the second paragraph.
</p>
```

## Styling paragraphs

By default, browsers separate paragraphs with a single blank line. Alternate separation methods, such as first-line indentation, can be achieved with {{glossary("CSS")}}:

### HTML

```html
<p>
  Separating paragraphs with blank lines is easiest for readers to scan, but
  they can also be separated by indenting their first lines. This is often used
  to take up less space, such as to save paper in print.
</p>

<p>
  Writing that is intended to be edited, such as school papers and rough drafts,
  uses both blank lines and indentation for separation. In finished works,
  combining both is considered redundant and amateurish.
</p>

<p>
  In very old writing, paragraphs were separated with a special character: ¶,
  the <i>pilcrow</i>. Nowadays, this is considered claustrophobic and hard to
  read.
</p>

<p>
  How hard to read? See for yourself:
  <button data-toggle-text="Oh no! Switch back!">
    Use pilcrow for paragraphs
  </button>
</p>
```

### CSS

```css
p {
  margin: 0;
  text-indent: 3ch;
}

p.pilcrow {
  text-indent: 0;
  display: inline;
}
p.pilcrow + p.pilcrow::before {
  content: " ¶ ";
}
```

### JavaScript

```js
document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  document.querySelectorAll("p").forEach((paragraph) => {
    paragraph.classList.toggle("pilcrow");
  });

  [event.target.innerText, event.target.dataset.toggleText] = [
    event.target.dataset.toggleText,
    event.target.innerText,
  ];
});

# <picture>: The Picture element

The **`<picture>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element contains zero or more {{HTMLElement("source")}} elements and one {{HTMLElement("img")}} element to offer alternative versions of an image for different display/device scenarios.

The browser will consider each child `<source>` element and choose the best match among them. If no matches are found—or the browser doesn't support the `<picture>` element—the URL of the `<img>` element's [`src`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/img#src) attribute is selected. The selected image is then presented in the space occupied by the `<img>` element.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;picture&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<!--Change the browser window width to see the image change.-->

<picture>
  <source
    srcset="/shared-assets/images/examples/surfer.jpg"
    media="(orientation: portrait)" />
  <img src="/shared-assets/images/examples/painted-hand.jpg" alt="" />
</picture>
```

To decide which URL to load, the {{Glossary("user agent")}} examines each `<source>`'s [`srcset`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/source#srcset), [`media`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/source#media), and [`type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/source#type) attributes to select a compatible image that best matches the current layout and capabilities of the display device.

The `<img>` element serves two purposes:

1. It describes the size and other attributes of the image and its presentation.
2. It provides a fallback in case none of the offered `<source>` elements are able to provide a usable image.

Common use cases for `<picture>`:

- **Art direction.** Cropping or modifying images for different `media` conditions (for example, loading a simpler version of an image which has too many details, on smaller displays).
- **Offering alternative image formats**, for cases where certain formats are not supported.

  > [!NOTE]
  > For example, newer formats like [AVIF](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Image_types#avif_image) or [WEBP](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Image_types#webp_image) have many advantages, but might not be supported by the browser. A list of supported image formats can be found in: [Image file type and format guide](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Image_types).

- **Saving bandwidth and speeding page load times** by loading the most appropriate image for the viewer's display.

If providing higher-density versions of an image for high-DPI (Retina) display, use [`srcset`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/img#srcset) on the `<img>` element instead. This lets browsers opt for lower-density versions in data-saving modes, and you don't have to write explicit `media` conditions.

## Attributes

This element includes only [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

## Usage notes

You can use the {{cssxref("object-position")}} property to adjust the positioning of the image within the element's frame, and the {{cssxref("object-fit")}} property to control how the image is resized to fit within the frame.

> [!NOTE]
> Use these properties on the child `<img>` element, **not** the `<picture>` element.

## Examples

These examples demonstrate how different attributes of the {{HTMLElement("source")}} element change the selection of the image inside `<picture>`.

### The media attribute

The `media` attribute specifies a media condition (similar to a media query) that the user agent will evaluate for each {{HTMLElement("source")}} element.

If the {{HTMLElement("source")}}'s media condition evaluates to `false`, the browser skips it and evaluates the next element inside `<picture>`.

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="mdn-logo-wide.png" media="(width >= 600px)" />
  <img src="mdn-logo-narrow.png" alt="MDN" />
</picture>
```

### The srcset attribute

The [srcset](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/source#srcset) attribute is used to offer a list of possible images based on size or the display's pixel density.

It is composed of a comma-separated list of image descriptors. Each image descriptor is composed of a URL of the image, and _either_:

- a _width descriptor_, followed by a `w` (such as `300w`);
  _OR_
- a _pixel density descriptor_, followed by an `x` (such as `2x`) to serve a high-res image for high-DPI screens.

Make sure to note that:

- width and pixel density descriptors should not be used together
- a missing pixel density descriptor implies 1x
- duplicate descriptor values are not allowed (2x & 2x, 100w & 100w)

The following example illustrates the usage of `srcset` attribute with the `<source>` element to specify a high-density and standard-resolution image:

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="logo.png, logo-1.5x.png 1.5x" />
  <img src="logo.png" alt="MDN Web Docs logo" height="320" width="320" />
</picture>
```

The `srcset` attribute can also be used on the `<img>` element without needing the `<picture>` element. The following example demonstrates how to use the `srcset` attribute to specify standard-resolution and high-density images, respectively:

```html
<img
  srcset="logo.png, logo-2x.png 2x"
  src="logo.png"
  height="320"
  width="320"
  alt="MDN Web Docs logo" />
```

### The sizes attribute

The [`sizes`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/source#sizes) attribute of the `<source>` element allows you to specify a set of media condition-length pairs and indicate the image display size for each condition. This helps the browser select the most appropriate image from the `srcset` attribute, which lists images with their [intrinsic](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Intrinsic_Size) widths.

The browser evaluates the media conditions in the sizes attribute before it downloads any images. See the sizes attribute of the [`<img>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/img#sizes) and [`<source>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/source#sizes) elements for more information.

For example:

```html
<picture>
  <source
    srcset="small.jpg 480w, medium.jpg 800w, large.jpg 1200w"
    sizes="(max-width: 600px) 400px, 800px"
    type="image/jpeg" />
  <img src="fallback.jpg" alt="Example image" />
</picture>
```

In this example:

- If the viewport is 600px wide or less, the slot size is 400px; otherwise, it is 800px.
- The browser multiplies the slot size by the device pixel ratio to determine the ideal image width, then picks the closest available image from `srcset`.

Without sizes, the browser will use the default size of the image as specified by its dimensions in pixels. This may not be the best fit for all devices, especially if the image is displayed on different screen sizes or in different contexts.

Please note that sizes will have its effect only if width dimension descriptors are provided with srcset instead of pixel ratio values (200w instead of 2x for example).
For more information on using `srcset`, see the [Responsive images](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Responsive_images) documentation.

### The type attribute

The `type` attribute specifies a [MIME type](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/MIME_types) for the resource URL(s) in the {{HTMLElement("source")}} element's `srcset` attribute. If the user agent does not support the given type, the {{HTMLElement("source")}} element is skipped.

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="photo.avif" type="image/avif" />
  <source srcset="photo.webp" type="image/webp" />
  <img src="photo.jpg" alt="photo" />
</picture>
```

# <plaintext>: The Plain Text element (Deprecated)

{{deprecated_header}}

The **`<plaintext>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element renders everything following the start tag as raw text, ignoring any following HTML. There is no closing tag, since everything after it is considered raw text.

> [!WARNING]

> - `<plaintext>` is deprecated since HTML 2, and not all browsers implemented it. Browsers that did implement it didn't do so consistently.
> - `<plaintext>` is obsolete; browsers that accept it may instead treat it as a {{HTMLElement("pre")}} element that still interprets HTML within.
> - If `<plaintext>` is the first element on the page (other than any non-displayed elements, like {{HTMLElement("head")}}), do not use HTML at all. Instead serve a text file with the `text/plain` [MIME-type](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side/Configuring_server_MIME_types).
> - Instead of `<plaintext>`, use the {{HTMLElement("pre")}} element or, if semantically accurate (such as for inline text), the {{HTMLElement("code")}} element. Escape any `<`, `>` and `&` characters, to prevent browsers inadvertently parsing the element content as HTML.
> - A monospaced font can be applied to any HTML element via a [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) {{cssxref("font-family")}} style with the `monospace` generic value.

# <pre>: The Preformatted Text element

The **`<pre>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents preformatted text which is to be presented exactly as written in the HTML file. The text is typically rendered using a non-proportional, or [monospaced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font) font.

Whitespace inside this element is displayed as written, with one exception. If one or more leading newline characters are included immediately following the opening `<pre>` tag, the _first_ newline character is stripped.

`<pre>` elements' text content is parsed as HTML, so if you want to ensure that your text content stays as plain text, some syntax characters, such as `<`, may need to be escaped using their respective {{glossary("character reference", "character references")}}. See [escaping ambiguous characters](#escaping_ambiguous_characters) for more information.

`<pre>` elements commonly contain {{HTMLElement("code")}}, {{HTMLElement("samp")}}, and {{HTMLElement("kbd")}} elements, to represent computer code, computer output, and user input, respectively.

By default, `<pre>` is a [block-level](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Block-level_content) element, i.e., its default {{cssxref("display")}} value is `block`.

## Attributes

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

- `width` {{deprecated_inline}} {{Non-standard_Inline}}
  - : Contains the _preferred_ count of characters that a line should have. Though technically still implemented, this attribute has no visual effect; to achieve such an effect, use CSS {{Cssxref("width")}} instead.
- `wrap` {{non-standard_inline}} {{Deprecated_Inline}}
  - : Is a _hint_ indicating how the overflow must happen. In modern browser this hint is ignored and no visual effect results in its present; to achieve such an effect, use CSS {{Cssxref("white-space")}} instead.

## Accessibility

It is important to provide an alternate description for any images or diagrams created using preformatted text. The alternate description should clearly and concisely describe the image or diagram's content.

People experiencing low vision conditions and browsing with the aid of assistive technology such as a screen reader may not understand what the preformatted text characters are representing when they are read out in sequence.

A combination of the {{HTMLElement("figure")}} and {{HTMLElement("figcaption")}} elements, supplemented by the [ARIA](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) `role` and [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) attributes on the `pre` element allow the preformatted {{Glossary("ASCII")}} art to be announced as an image with alternative text, and the `figcaption` serving as the image's caption.

### Example

```html
<figure>
  <pre role="img" aria-label="ASCII COW">
      ___________________________
  &lt; I'm an expert in my field. &gt;
      ---------------------------
          \   ^__^
           \  (oo)\_______
              (__)\       )\/\
                  ||----w |
                  ||     ||
  </pre>
  <figcaption id="cow-caption">
    A cow saying, "I'm an expert in my field." The cow is illustrated using
    preformatted text characters.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
```

### Escaping ambiguous characters

Suppose you want to demonstrate HTML code in a `<pre>` element. The character sequences that define valid HTML tags (starting with `<` and ending with `>`) will not be displayed. To display the tag characters as text, you need to escape (at least) the `<` character using its character reference, so that the sequences no longer define valid tags.

In reality, the HTML parser treats most characters as plain text unless in specific contexts. For example, `< code` is fine, but `<code` would be misparsed; `&am;` is fine, but `&amp;` is not. However, it's a good practice to escape all ambiguous characters to avoid any confusion, especially if you are programmatically generating HTML and injecting the `<pre>` content. In this case, here's a good rule of thumb for how to escape characters:

1. First, write the content out, as you would like it to appear in the HTML document.
2. Replace any ampersands (`&`) with `&amp;`. Do this step first, so that new `&` characters generated in the next step don't get escaped.
3. Replace any `<` characters with `&lt;`.

This should result in the content being displayed as you intended. The replacement of other HTML syntax characters is optional (like `>` to `&gt;`, `"` to `&quot;`, and `'` to `&apos;`), but will do no harm.

#### HTML

```html
<pre><code>
let i = 5;

if (i &lt; 10 &amp;&amp; i &gt; 0)
  return &quot;Single Digit Number&quot;
</code></pre>
```

# <progress>: The Progress Indicator element

The **`<progress>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element displays an indicator showing the completion progress of a task, typically displayed as a progress bar.

{{InteractiveExample("HTML Demo: &lt;progress&gt;", "tabbed-standard")}}

```html interactive-example
<label for="file">File progress:</label>

<progress id="file" max="100" value="70">70%</progress>
```

```css interactive-example
label {
  padding-right: 10px;
  font-size: 1rem;
}
```

## Attributes

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

- [`max`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/max)
  - : This attribute describes how much work the task indicated by the `progress` element requires. The `max` attribute, if present, must have a value greater than `0` and be a valid floating point number. The default value is `1`.
- `value`
  - : This attribute specifies how much of the task that has been completed. It must be a valid floating point number between `0` and `max`, or between `0` and `1` if `max` is omitted. If there is no `value` attribute, the progress bar is indeterminate; this indicates that an activity is ongoing with no indication of how long it is expected to take.

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike the {{htmlelement("meter")}} element, the minimum value is always 0, and the `min` attribute is not allowed for the `<progress>` element.

> [!NOTE]
> The {{cssxref(":indeterminate")}} pseudo-class can be used to match against indeterminate progress bars. To change the progress bar to indeterminate after giving it a value you must remove the value attribute with {{domxref("Element.removeAttribute", "element.removeAttribute('value')")}}.

## Accessibility

### Labelling

In most cases you should provide an accessible label when using `<progress>`. While you can use the standard ARIA labelling attributes [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) or [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) as you would for any element with `role="progressbar"`, when using `<progress>` you can alternatively use the {{htmlelement("label")}} element.

> [!NOTE]
> Text placed between the element's tags is not an accessible label, it is only recommended as a fallback for old browsers that do not support this element.

#### Examples

```html
<label>
  Uploading Document: <progress value="70" max="100">70 %</progress>
</label>

<!-- OR -->
<br />

<label for="progress-bar">Uploading Document</label>
<progress id="progress-bar" value="70" max="100">70 %</progress>
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample('Labelling')}}

### Describing a particular region

If the `<progress>` element is describing the loading progress of a section of a page, use [`aria-describedby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-describedby) to point to the status, and set [`aria-busy="true"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-busy) on the section that is being updated, removing the `aria-busy` attribute when it has finished loading.

#### Examples

```html
<div aria-busy="true" aria-describedby="progress-bar">
  <!-- content is for this region is loading -->
</div>

<!-- ... -->

<progress id="progress-bar" aria-label="Content loading…"></progress>
```

##### Result

## Examples

```html
<progress value="70" max="100">70 %</progress>
```
