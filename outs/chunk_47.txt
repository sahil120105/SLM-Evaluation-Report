# Manipulator in the Middle (MITM)

In a Manipulator in the Middle (MITM) attack, the attacker inserts themselves between two entities that are trying to communicating with each other.

On the web, an MITM attack generally takes place between the user's browser and the server, and enables the attacker to see and potentially modify any of the traffic exchanged over HTTP.

A common way for an attacker to execute an MITM attack is to set up a wireless access point in a public place, such as a cafe or an airport, and wait for a victim to connect to it. If a victim does connect, then the attacker will be able to read and modify any data exchanged between the user's browser and any sites they connect to.

## Defenses against MITM

The primary defense against MITM is to serve your site over {{glossary("HTTPS")}} (HTTP over {{glossary("TLS")}}). HTTPS prevents an attacker from reading traffic, or from modifying it in a predictable way.

You should serve all pages over HTTPS, not just pages that you consider especially sensitive.

### Use a secure TLS configuration

To support HTTPS, a website needs a TLS certificate. [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is a widely used nonprofit Certification Authority which issues free TLS certificates.

Not all TLS configurations are equally secure: if you need to configure your own server, consult a resource such as Mozilla's [TLS Recommended Configurations](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Recommended_configurations).

Modern web hosting services support HTTPS for you, either by default or through a configuration setting. In this situation, the hosting service is likely to manage your certificate and configure the server on your behalf.

### Load subresources over HTTPS

When a page loads resources (scripts, stylesheets, fonts, images, and so on), these resources should also be served over HTTPS. If a page is loaded over HTTPS and it attempts to load resources over HTTP, then the browser will either try to upgrade the load request to use HTTPS or will block the request: this is called [mixed content blocking](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content).

If it's not possible for you to update your code to load resources from HTTPS URLs (for example, because your HTML has been archived) your server can set a [content security policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP) that contains the [`upgrade-insecure-requests`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP#upgrading_insecure_requests) directive, and the browser will automatically upgrade these requests to HTTPS.

### Use HSTS when upgrading HTTP requests

Even if your site is only served over HTTPS, users may still request it over HTTP: for example, by typing `http://example.org` into the address bar. To enable your site to work in cases like this, you can listen for HTTP requests and use a [301 Moved Permanently](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/301) response to redirect to the HTTPS version.

However, this gives attackers the opportunity to intercept the initial exchange, and then prevent the upgrade to HTTPS from happening. This is sometimes called an _SSL stripping_ attack ({{glossary("SSL")}} is the precursor to TLS).

To reduce the risk of this attack, your server should also send the {{httpheader("Strict-Transport-Security")}} HTTP response header (also known as HSTS): this informs clients that you wish them to use HTTPS, and will cause the browser to connect using HTTPS directly for any subsequent visits, even those made using HTTP URLs.

With HSTS, SSL stripping is prevented except for the first time the browser tries to connect to your site (or, since HSTS has an expiry, the first time after an HSTS record in the browser has expired). To protect your site even on first connection or HSTS record expiry, Chrome maintains a list of domains called the [HSTS preload list](https://hstspreload.org/): if a domain is on this list, then Chrome will always upgrade HTTP request to HTTPS, effectively behaving as if the server has already sent the HSTS header. Safari and Firefox have similar behavior, using a list that is derived from the Chrome list.

### Defense summary checklist

- Serve all your site's pages and subresources over HTTPS.
- If you want to redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS, use HSTS, and consider adding your site to the HSTS preload list.

# Phishing

Phishing is a {{glossary("social engineering")}} attack in which a user is tricked into believing that they are interacting with a site with which they have an account, when in reality they are interacting with the attacker. The attacker convinces the user to enter their credentials on the fake site, and thereby steals the user's credentials.

## Overview

Phishing is a very old but still very common attack, which has gone through many variations, both to evade defenses and to take advantage of new vulnerabilities. In a basic form, though:

1. The attacker registers a domain name that resembles the target site. For example, if the user's banking website is `my-bank.example.com`, the attacker could register `my-bank.examp1e.com`.
2. The attacker creates a site at that address that resembles the real site.
3. The attacker sends the user an email, purporting to be from `my-bank.example.com`, giving some reason to ask the user to visit the site, and containing a link to the fake site `my-bank.examp1e.com`.
4. The user clicks the link and is asked to sign in. They enter their username and password, and the attacker now has their credentials.

Phishing attacks sometimes use different techniques to contact their victims, such as text messages or voice calls, and sometimes don't involve websites at all, convincing users to tell them passwords or PIN codes verbally.

Some phishing attacks are highly indiscriminate, sending out many messages to potential victims, in the hope that some will be tricked. In _spear-phishing_ attacks, on the other hand, attackers research specific victims, gathering personal information about them to make the lure more convincing. For example, the email may purport to come from someone the victim knows, and even include private information.

Phishing attacks are not dependent on naive or inexperienced users: decades of experience has shown that even highly experienced and knowledgeable users can be vulnerable to phishing attacks, especially when they are busy, tired, or distracted.

## Defenses

One thing that makes phishing challenging for a website to defend against is that the target site is not involved at all in the attack. It's entirely dependent on the user being tricked by the attacker. In this section we will discuss some practices that can help, but the only one that is really effective is using [passkeys](#web_authentication_passkeys) instead of passwords.

### DNS configuration

Phishing emails often forge the sender address, to make the victim think that the email really came from the target website. Three {{glossary("DNS")}} records help email servers detect these forgeries, which helps ensure that phishing emails are marked as spam in the victim's email client, or are blocked entirely.

- The [Security Policy Framework (SPF)](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-spf-record/) record lists addresses that are allowed to send an email from the domain. A receiving email server extracts the domain name from the email's `Return-Path` header, and looks up the SPF record associated with that domain.
- The [DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-dkim-record/) record enables the sender to {{glossary("digital signature", "digitally sign")}} emails. The receiving server extracts the domain name from the signature, and uses it to look up looks up the DKIM record associated with that domain. The DKIM record includes the public key used to verify the signature. The domain name in the signature must also be aligned with the domain name in the email's `From` header (this essentially means that the domain names must match or the value in the `From` header must be a subdomain of the domain in the signature).
- The [Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC)](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-dmarc-record/) tells the recipient how to handle SPF and DKIM failures: whether to quarantine them as spam, reject them, or allow them.

You should set these DNS records for your domains, to help email servers recognize forged messages.

### Password managers

Password managers can provide some degree of protection against phishing attacks. They fulfill three main functions:

- **Password generation**: Creating strong passwords when users sign up.
- **Password storage**: Storing a user's passwords securely, so the user doesn't have to remember them (and can therefore use stronger passwords)
- **Password entry**: Automatically entering the user's password for a site, when the user visits the site's login page.

It's the last of these that can help against phishing. The user might not see the difference between the fake domain `my-bank.examp1e.com` and the real domain `my-bank.example.com`, but the password manager will, and as a result it will not automatically enter the real password on the fake site. With luck, this will be enough of a warning to the user that the login request is not legitimate.

As a web developer, you can't make your users use a password manager. But you can, if you are not careful, make it impossible for password managers to integrate with your site. The article [Making password managers play ball with your login form](https://hidde.blog/making-password-managers-play-ball-with-your-login-form/) is an excellent summary of practices to follow, and practices to avoid, if you want users to be able to use password managers on your site. It's also important to test your site with password managers, both those built into browsers and popular standalone applications.

Unfortunately, users have been trained to expect tools to fail sometimes, and to work around their failures. So even if a user has a password manager, and it works with your site, and it does not auto-fill the password during a phishing attempt, you still have no guarantee that the user will not just paste the password in manually.

### Multi-factor authentication

Using {{glossary("multi-factor authentication", "multi-factor authentication (MFA)")}} to authenticate users makes phishing more difficult but, depending on the specific method used, does not prevent it.

In particular, in the most common MFA implementations, the user has to enter their password and another code, called a _one-time password_ (OTP), which is unique to this login attempt. Two common variants are:

- SMS-based OTP:
  - The user provides their cellphone number when they register.
  - After the user has supplied their username and password, the website sends an SMS to the user which contains an OTP.
  - The user enters the OTP.
  - If the OTP values match, the user is signed in.

- Time-based OTP (TOTP):
  - The user has an authenticator app installed.
  - After the user has supplied their username and password, the website calculates an OTP using the current time as input.
  - The user's authenticator does the same calculation, and the user enters the OTP that the app generated.
  - If the OTP values match, the user is signed in.

TOTP is considered more secure than SMS-based OTP, because it is possible for attackers to intercept SMS messages. However, from the point of view of phishing, both methods are vulnerable.

To phish a user who uses OTP as a second factor, the attacker's fake site is an active manipulator in the middle, between the user and the real site:

1. The attacker sends the user the email, containing the link to the fake site.
2. The user clicks the link in the email, and enters their username and password in the fake site.
3. The fake site relays the username and password to the real site.
4. The real site generates a TOTP.
5. The fake site asks the user to enter their TOTP.
6. The user's authenticator app generates the same TOTP, and the user enters it on the fake site.
7. The fake site relays the TOTP to the real site, and the attacker is given access.

![Diagram showing how a phishing attack can work against 2-factor TOTP authentication](totp-phish.svg)

This is much more difficult than just phishing a password, because the attacker must operate in real time. However, phishing toolkits greatly reduce the complexity of accomplishing it.

### Web Authentication (passkeys)

The strongest technical defense against phishing is to authenticate users using _passkeys_, which are based on the [Web Authentication API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API).

A passkey is created when the user registers on the site, and is specific to the {{glossary("origin")}} for which it was originally created. The passkey is generated by, and stored in, a module called an _authenticator_, which is built into or attached to the user's device.

Unlike passwords or OTP codes, a user never manually enters a passkey on a site: in fact, the passkey is never transmitted to the site at all. When a website asks the user to authenticate using Web Authentication, the browser asks the authenticator for a passkey that matches the site's origin. If it can find one, the authenticator generates a token which the browser sends to the website. The website verifies the token and signs the user in.

Because the passkey is specific to the site's origin, if a passkey was created for the user's account at `my-bank.example.com`, the user will not be able to use it on `my-bank.examp1e.com`. The browser just won't consider it applicable to the fake site.

This makes passkeys an effective defense against phishing. Passkeys are a much newer authentication method than passwords or OTP, and the tooling surrounding them is less mature. However, this is changing, and passkeys may eventually displace passwords as the most common authentication method on the web.

### Personalized security indicator

Another phishing defense, which isn't often used any more, is for the website to display a secret message or image to the user on its login page.

1. After the user signs up, the user is asked to choose a secret message or image to be associated with their account.
2. When the user signs in, they first enter their username.
3. The login page then shows the secret associated with the account.
4. If the secret is not what the user expected, then the user should not enter their password.

The idea is that the attacker doesn't know what the secret is, so can't display it on the fake login page.

In a variation of this technique, the website uses a persistent cookie to decide which secret to display, instead of the username.

In practice there are a few difficulties with this technique:

- It relies on the user paying attention to the security indicator: that is, it relies on user education. Experience has shown that as a general principle (that is, out of a controlled context such as a securely managed corporation) user education is not very effective in preventing phishing attacks.
- Depending on the mechanism used to decide which secret to display, it may be vulnerable to the same manipulator in the middle attack as MFA.
- The mechanism the server uses to decide which secret to display may be vulnerable: for example, it may be easier for an attacker to discover a username than to discover a password. With a username, an attacker could determine the secret and build a convincing fake site.

As a result of these weaknesses, this defense is rarely used: both MFA and passkeys are considered to be stronger defenses.

### Defense summary checklist

- Set `SPF`, `DKIM`, and `DMARC` DNS records for your domains.
- Consider using passkeys to authenticate users.
- If you use passwords, consider using MFA, and ensure that password managers can work with your site.
# Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Server‑Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to make network requests to arbitrary destinations. SSRF makes these requests originate from within a server itself, which typically has broader access than an external client.

This can enable an attacker to access sensitive resources or to perform other unauthorized actions.

## Example scenario

Suppose your application has an endpoint that fetches images from a provided URL:

```http
GET /fetch-image?url=https://example.com/image.png
```

The server has access to the company's intranet.

If the server does not validate the URL parameter is is given, then the client can extract sensitive data by passing intranet URLs to the API:

```js
fetch("https://example.org/fetch-image?url=http://localhost:443/admin/org.png");
```

Although the client could not access `http://localhost:443/` directly, the server can, and the server relays the response to the client.

The client doesn't have to make HTTP requests: it might be able to use the `file://` protocol:

```js
fetch("https://example.org/fetch-image?url=file:///etc/passwd");
```

In these cases the attacker could get access to sensitive data. Sometimes the attacker does not get the response body, but in this case it can still cause problems:

- By forcing the server to make many requests an attacker can execute a {{glossary("Denial of Service", "Denial of Service (DoS)")}} attack.
- By examining the status code returned by the server or the time taken to execute requests, the attacker may infer sensitive information about the target.

Attackers may use redirects or redirect chains to evade validation. For example, they could own a domain `https://evilexample.org/redirect` and all that host does is to redirect to `http://localhost:443/` or other (internal) URLs potentially bypassing input validation.

```js
fetch("https://example.org/fetch-image?url=https://evilexample.org/redirect");
```

## Defenses against SSRF

Mitigating SSRF vulnerabilities requires multiple defense strategies combining input validation, careful response handling, and a secure network architecture. Some key approaches include:

### Input validation and allow-listing

Restrict the URLs that the server API will use. For example, the `fetch-image` service discussed above could specify an allow list containing the expected domains:

```js
const ALLOWED_DOMAINS = ["https://api.example.com", "https://cdn.example.com"];
```

### Blocking protocols and URL schemes

Ensure only specific URL schemes are allowed. Most likely only allowing `https://` is enough for regular web applications.

### Redirect validation

Do not follow redirects automatically and also enforce input validation and/or allow-listing to redirected URLs. Limit redirect chains.

### Least privilege and isolation

Ensure the service making outbound requests does not run with any more privileges than it needs, and avoid co-locating request-capable services with sensitive internal services.

## Defense summary checklist

- Review all features that fetch resources and validate or allow-list user inputs.
- Block all protocols except for HTTPS.
- Beware of URL redirections and limit redirect chains.
- Apply the principle of least privilege for server network permissions: ideally servers should not have unrestricted access to internal networks unless required.
- Log and monitor requests.

# Subdomain takeover

A subdomain takeover occurs when an attacker gains control over a subdomain of a target domain. Typically, this happens when the subdomain has a canonical name ([CNAME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record)) in the Domain Name System ([DNS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/DNS)), but no host is providing content for it. This can happen because either a virtual host hasn't been published yet or a virtual host has been removed. An attacker can take over that subdomain by providing their own virtual host and then hosting their own content for it.

If an attacker can do this, they can potentially read [cookies](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Cookies) set from the main domain, perform [cross-site scripting](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/XSS), or circumvent [content security policies](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP), thereby enabling them to capture protected information (including logins) or send malicious content to unsuspecting users.

A subdomain is like an electrical outlet. If you have your own appliance (host) plugged into it, everything is fine. However, if you remove your appliance from the outlet (or haven't plugged one in yet), someone can plug in a different one. You must cut power at the breaker or fuse box (DNS) to prevent the outlet from being used by someone else.

## How do they happen?

If the process of provisioning or deprovisioning (removing) a virtual host is not handled properly, there can be an opportunity for an attacker to take over a subdomain.

### During provisioning

An attacker sets up a virtual host for a subdomain name you bought on the hosting provider, before you get to do it.

Suppose you control the domain example.com. You want to add a blog at blog.example.com, and you decide to use a hosting provider who maintains a blogging platform. (For "blog", you can substitute "e-commerce platform", "customer service platform", or any other "cloud-based" virtual hosting scenario.) The process you go through might look like this:

1. You register the name "blog.example.com" with a domain registrar.
2. You set up DNS records to direct browsers that want to access blog.example.com so that they go to the virtual host.
3. You create a virtual host at the hosting provider.

Unless the hosting provider is very careful to verify that the entity who sets up the virtual host actually is the owner of the subdomain name, an attacker who is quicker than you could create a virtual host with the same hosting provider, using your subdomain name. In such a case, as soon as you set up DNS in step 2, the attacker can host content on your subdomain.

### During deprovisioning

You take down your virtual host, but an attacker sets up a new virtual host using the same name and hosting provider.

You (or your company) decide that you no longer want to maintain a blog, so you remove the virtual host from the hosting provider. However, if you don't remove the DNS entry that points to the hosting provider, an attacker can now create their own virtual host with that provider, claim your subdomain, and host their own content under that subdomain.

## Defenses against Subdomain takeover

Preventing subdomain takeovers is a matter of order of operations in lifecycle management for virtual hosts and DNS. Depending on the size of the organization, this may require communication and coordination across multiple departments, which can only increase the likelihood for a vulnerable misconfiguration.

- Define standard processes for provisioning and deprovisioning hosts. Do all steps as closely together as possible.
  - Start provisioning by claiming the virtual host; create DNS records _last_.
  - Start deprovisioning by removing DNS records _first_.

- Create an inventory of all of your organization's domains and their hosting providers, and update it as things change, to ensure that nothing is left dangling.
- Put pressure on hosting vendors to close gaps; ask how they verify that someone claiming a virtual host actually has a legitimate claim to the domain name. Work within your organization to make this part of the vendor qualification process.

## My subdomain has been taken over. What should I do?

If you discover that a subdomain of your domain has been taken over, the first step, if possible, is to "cut power" by removing the DNS entry for the subdomain. If your site has multiple layers of virtualization (e.g., a [CDN](/en-US/docs/Glossary/CDN) in addition to virtual hosting), you may need to examine each layer to see where exactly the attacker asserted their virtual host claim to take over your domain.

# Supply chain attacks

A _software supply chain_ consists of all the software and tools used to create and maintain a software product. This includes not only the software developed for the product itself but all the software and tools used in its production.

In a supply chain attack, the attacker targets part of the product's supply chain in order to compromise the product itself.

The most obvious example here is a third-party library. If you use, for example, an [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package developed by a third party, it has the ability to compromise your site. It may do so deliberately, if it is malicious, or accidentally, if it contains inadvertent vulnerabilities of its own. Essentially, you have to trust your third-party dependencies as much as you trust your own code.

Less obviously, the same principle applies to all the tools you use in creating your software, including code editors, editor plugins, version control systems, build tools, and so on. Any of these tools could insert malicious or vulnerable code into your final software product, in the course of the transformations they apply.

In this document we'll outline practices to follow to secure your software supply chain. It's organized into two main sections:

- [Securing your development environment](#securing_your_development_environment): practices to help ensure your own code isn't compromised.
- [Managing third-party dependencies](#managing_third-party_dependencies): practices to help ensure that your dependencies are not compromised.

## Securing your development environment

One route for a supply chain attack is for an attacker to introduce vulnerabilities or malicious code directly into your own product. In this section we'll describe some practices that can counter this threat.

### Implementing access control

Implement strong access control for everyone working on the project, including anyone with write access to your code repository or with the permissions to modify the build or testing configuration. Good practices here include:

- Requiring {{glossary("multi-factor authentication")}} for team members.
- Following the {{glossary("principle of least privilege")}}: that is, only giving privileges to team members that need them, and actively minimizing the number of team members that are granted very powerful permissions.

### Securing tools

Assess the security risk of any of the tools you use in the production of your site, including:

- Text editors and IDEs
- Editor plugins
- Source control systems
- All tools involved in your build, test, and deployment processes

For open source software dependencies, you can use the [Concise Guide for Evaluating Open Source Software](https://best.openssf.org/Concise-Guide-for-Evaluating-Open-Source-Software), published by the [OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/), as a guide.

### Securing your configuration

Understand and apply secure settings for your tools, especially your source control system. Key protections are:

- Ensuring that pull requests (PRs) go through review and explicit approval from a code owner before they can be merged.
- Ensuring that PRs pass {{glossary("continuous integration")}} checks before they can be merged.
- Requiring that commits are signed.

See the OpenSSF's [Source Code Management Platform Configuration Best Practices](https://best.openssf.org/SCM-BestPractices/), which includes specific checklists for GitHub and GitLab.

## Managing third-party dependencies

Third-party dependencies include not only libraries and frameworks that your code uses, but all third-party tools involved in the development process, including editors, IDEs, source control systems, package managers, and build tools.

To mitigate problems with third-party dependencies, we'll discuss four practices:

1. Evaluating new dependencies
2. Updating existing dependencies
3. Maintaining a _Software Bill of Materials_ (SBOM)
4. Using Subresource Integrity for external scripts

### Evaluating new dependencies

Before adding a new dependency, you should assess how much of a security risk it represents. You need to be confident that the dependency is actively maintained, that it has a record of fixing issues and a process for reporting and responding to security vulnerabilities.

You should consider whether the risk of adding the dependency outweighs the cost of implementing the feature yourself.

The [Concise Guide for Evaluating Open Source Software](https://best.openssf.org/Concise-Guide-for-Evaluating-Open-Source-Software), published by the [OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/), lists questions you should ask before adding a new dependency.

### Updating dependencies

Once you have added a dependency to your project, the dependency's supplier will typically release new versions with new features, bug fixes, and security fixes. You will usually want to take advantage of these updates, by implementing a mechanism to keep the dependency up to date. Tools such as GitHub's [dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/dependabot-quickstart-guide) can help with this, by detecting new versions of dependencies and automatically opening pull requests to update your project.

However, updating dependencies too eagerly comes with its own risks. For example, suppose you add a dependency on a trustworthy third-party package. An attacker then gets control of the package developer's account, and publishes a malicious update. If you immediately accept the update, your project is compromised.

#### Using a lockfile

The first step towards securing dependency updates is to use a _lockfile_ for dependencies, commit it to source control, and use it when building your project.

Package managers like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) let you provide a file such as [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/configuring-npm/package-json/) that lists your project's dependencies. You can then run a command that installs the given dependencies so the project can use them.

However, the dependency list doesn't determine the exact version of each package: if the package supplier releases a new version, then it may be automatically included in your project when it is built. If the new version of the dependency is malicious, it may be included in your project automatically, without you even being aware of it.

For example, suppose your package.json includes a dependency named "example-dependency":

```json
{
  "name": "example-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "example-dependency": "^1.0.2"
  }
}
```

Suppose your project's build process automatically runs when your suppliers release new versions. The build process starts the build by calling `npm install`. This will fetch the latest version of "example-dependency", subject to the version range `"^1.0.2"`.

At version `1.0.2`, which is the point you added it to the project, "example-dependency" is a useful, benign package. Then an attacker takes over the account belonging to the developer of "example-dependency", and publishes a malicious `1.0.3` version. Your build process runs, installs the malicious package, and you are compromised.

All this has happened without any changes to your project's direct artifacts, or any opportunity for you to review the update and see if it looks suspicious.

The solution to this is to use a lockfile when building your project. A lockfile is automatically generated whenever a project's dependencies are installed, and it lists the exact versions of the direct and indirect dependencies used in a project.

That is, if _package.json_ tells you that your project is using "example-project", then _package.lock_ will tell you exactly which version of "example-project" to use, and what the versions of its dependencies are.

Your project's lockfile should be checked into source control. When building your project you should use the lockfile to control which versions of your dependencies are installed: in npm you do this by using [`npm ci`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/commands/npm-ci/) instead of `npm install`.

> [!NOTE]
> Fixing the versions of your dependencies in this way is sometimes called "version pinning".

This means that to update dependencies, your build system has to make a pull request to update the lockfile, and this gives you the chance to review the update and ensure you want to accept it.

#### Reviewing updates

When reviewing an update to a dependency, consider whether it's an update you want to accept:

- Read the changelog for the release, to understand what it claims to be offering (and whether you need to accept it at all, at this point).
- See if it introduces any additional dependencies.
- If possible, review the source code updates, and see if any of them are inexplicable or don't match up with the changelog.
- Consider waiting a little while before updating: often, supply chain attacks are quickly discovered by security researchers, and it is better for you if an update is found to be malicious before you have accepted it.

### Maintaining a Software Bill of Materials

To get a deeper insight into your dependencies, you can maintain a detailed inventory of them. This is called a _Software Bill of Materials_ (SBOM).

A lockfile is really a kind of SBOM: however, the term "SBOM" usually refers to a separate standard format for representing dependencies. These standards are usually both broader and deeper than a lockfile. That is:

- They can capture dependencies, such as web services, that are not represented in a lockfile.
- They can capture additional information about each dependency, that is not represented in a lockfile.

Using a standard format for representing an SBOM also means you can:

- Share your SBOM with third parties
- Integrate tools that can understand your SBOM for purposes such as regulatory compliance or vulnerability monitoring.

The two most common standards for representing a software bill of materials are:

- [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/), originally developed by [OWASP](https://owasp.org/).
- [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/), maintained by the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).

Both these standards have good support, and you can use either to represent the SBOM for your project. SPDX was initially focused on helping products ensure that they are compliant with open source software licenses, but has added features to support security use cases. CycloneDX is a newer and more lightweight standard which was focused from the start on promoting supply chain security.

#### Anatomy of an SBOM

> [!NOTE]
> In this section we'll use CycloneDX as a concrete example of an SBOM format.
>
> This section only provides an brief introduction to some of the most fundamental parts of the CycloneDX object model. For the full details, see the CycloneDX [Authoritative Guide to SBOM](https://cyclonedx.org/guides/OWASP_CycloneDX-Authoritative-Guide-to-SBOM-en.pdf).

In CycloneDX, all dependencies are either _components_ or _services_.

- Components include, but are not limited to, software frameworks, libraries, applications, and configuration data.
- Services represent external APIs that software may call, for example through endpoint URIs.

Every component and service used in the product, either directly or indirectly, is represented by an object in the SBOM. The object includes information about the item including its name, version, author, license, description, {{glossary("hash_function", "hashes")}} (for components) and endpoint URIs (for services).

The SBOM also lists vulnerabilities that have been identified in the product's dependencies. Each item in the list contains information about this vulnerability, including a description, a set of [CWE](https://cwe.mitre.org/index.html) codes, mitigations, links to advisories, and the identifiers for the components or services that the vulnerability affects.

#### Creating an SBOM

You can generate an SBOM for a product using a separate tool such as [cdxgen](https://cyclonedx.github.io/cdxgen/#/) or a command such as [`npm sbom`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/commands/npm-sbom/). An SBOM is usually generated as part of the build process, although it is possible to generate one at other stages of the software lifecycle.

#### Using an SBOM

An SBOM enables you to implement several defenses against supply chain attacks, and we'll list three important ones here:

- **Vulnerability management**: one of the main uses for an SBOM is to respond to vulnerabilities that have been identified in your dependencies. You can use third-party tools such as OWASP's [Dependency-Track](https://dependencytrack.org/), which automate this by scanning sources of vulnerability reports such as the [NIST National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) or [GitHub Advisories](https://github.com/advisories).
- **Integrity verification**: if the SBOM contains hashes for dependencies, it's possible to verify that the source of the component you're depending on has not been modified from its original released form.
- **Supplier risk management**: by capturing information about the supplier of your dependencies, an SBOM can help you understand when you are depending on components or services from suppliers that are no longer considered reliable.

### Using Subresource Integrity

Many websites include externally hosted scripts: most notably, but not exclusively, scripts that are served from a {{glossary("CDN", "Content Delivery Network (CDN)")}}:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.example.org/library.js"></script>
```

This represents a risk to your supply chain: if an attacker can get control of the `cdn.example.org` domain, they can replace the script with a malicious script, and thus compromise your site.

External scripts, like other software dependencies, should be part of your SBOM, but an additional defense is to set the script's [`integrity`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/script#integrity) attribute:

```html
<script
  src="https://cdn.example.org/library.js"
  integrity="sha256-d5f450f7ce715d827de27ca569e183f819d33c1e7601875fd61eccbc98f56c5b"></script>
```

The value of this attribute contains a {{glossary("hash_function", "cryptographic hash")}} of the script's contents. If the script has been modified by an attacker, then the browser will refuse to load it, and you will be protected.

This does add an extra maintenance burden: every time the source changes (for example, every time a new version is released) you must update the attribute's value in your code.

The {{htmlelement("link")}} element also supports the `integrity` attribute, so you can (and should) use it for CSS stylesheets as well as scripts.

See [Subresource Integrity](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) for more details.

## Defense summary checklist

- Require {{glossary("multi-factor authentication")}} for team members and minimize permissions granted.
- Assess tools involved in your build, test, and deployment processes.
- Ensure pull requests go through review and pass {{glossary("continuous integration")}} checks.
- Minimize your dependencies, and follow a process for evaluating new dependencies.
- Use a lockfile to control updates to your dependencies, and follow a process for accepting updates.
- Maintain an SBOM and use it to check for vulnerabilities.
- Use Subresource Integrity for externally referenced scripts and stylesheets.

# Cross-site leaks (XS-Leaks)

Cross-site leaks (also called XS-Leaks) are a class of attack in which an attacker's site can derive information about the target site, or about the user's relationship with the target site, by using web platform APIs that enable sites to interact with one another. The information leaked could include, for example:

- Whether the user has visited the target site.
- Whether the user is logged into the target site.
- What the user's ID on the site is.
- What the user has recently searched for on the site.

This might seem to be a much less damaging problem than, for example, a [cross-site scripting](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/XSS) attack, but it can still have serious consequences for users. For example:

- A user might have accounts on websites that they don't want to make public. Leaking this information to an attacker could expose them to extortion or retaliation from an oppressive government (for example, against a user seeking information about specific medical procedures).
- Knowing a user has an account on a site, especially if their user ID can be determined, can make a subsequent phishing attack much more convincing.

Unlike other attacks such as [XSS](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/XSS) or [Clickjacking](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/Clickjacking), cross-site leaks are not a single technique. Instead, they are a term for a whole class of attack which exploit weaknesses in the ways that browsers isolate websites from each other.

In this guide we will not attempt to describe every cross-site leak attack and defense. Instead, we'll start by describing a few example attacks, then outline the common underlying weaknesses that enable them, then describe some general defenses that can work against many known attacks.

## Sample cross-site leaks

In this section we'll describe three different cross-site leaks, to give an idea of how they work.

- [Leaking page existence using error events](#leaking_page_existence_using_error_events): in this attack, an attacker can determine whether particular endpoints in the target site return HTTP error codes, by attempting to load them as resources and listening for the {{domxref("HTMLElement/error_event", "error")}} and {{domxref("HTMLElement/load_event", "load")}} events. If certain pages are only available to logged-in users, the attacker can determine whether the user is signed into the target site.
- [Frame counting using window references](#frame_counting_using_window_references): in this attack, the attacker gets a reference to a {{domxref("Window", "window")}} object hosting a page in the target site, for example as the return value of a call to {{domxref("Window.open()", "window.open()")}}. The attacker can then determine the number of {{htmlelement("iframe")}} elements in the target page, which again might reveal whether the user is signed into the target.
- [Leaking redirects with a CSP](#leaking_redirects_with_a_csp): in this attack, the attacker's page has a [Content Security Policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP) that only allows a particular page from the target site to be loaded, and then attempts to load that page. If the page load is blocked, the attacker knows that the target redirected the request. This redirect may indicate that the user was logged (or not logged in) depending on how the site works.

All three attacks are deployed in the same way: the attacker crafts a page that implements the attack, then persuades the user to visit the page, for example by sending them an email or sharing a post containing the link. When the user visits the page the attack executes automatically.

In the rest of this section we'll describe these three attacks in a little more detail, to give you a concrete sense of how they work. Although the three attacks target quite different parts of the web platform, they have a common underlying cause: the extent to which the browser enables websites to connect to and interact with each other by mechanisms such as framing, loading subresources, or opening new windows.

> [!NOTE]
> For a more complete catalog of cross-site leaks, see the [XS-Leaks Wiki](https://xsleaks.dev/) and the [OWASP Cross-site Leaks Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XS_Leaks_Cheat_Sheet.html).

### Leaking page existence using error events

In this attack, the attacker tests whether specific pages in the target site can be loaded, by seeing whether attempts to embed them as resources generate an error. If these pages are only available to logged-in users, an attacker could determine whether a user is logged in.

The attack relies on the ability of a website to load a resource from another site, for example by setting the `src` attribute of a {{htmlelement("script")}} element to the URL of the resource:

```js
const script = document.createElement("script");
script.src = "https://example.org/admin";
document.head.appendChild(script);
```

This results in an HTTP request to the `https://example.org/` website. If the request includes cookies that the site uses to identify users, and the page requested is only available to logged-in users, then the success or failure of the request reveals whether or not the user is logged in.

If the request fails, for example because the server returns an HTTP {{httpstatus("404")}} status code, then the element fires an {{domxref("HTMLElement.error_event", "error")}} event. If the request succeeds, the element fires a {{domxref("HTMLElement.load_event", "load")}} event. By listening for these events, the attacker can discover whether the user is logged in.

```js
const url = "https://example.org/admin";
const script = document.createElement("script");

script.addEventListener("load", (e) => {
  console.log(`${url} exists`);
});

script.addEventListener("error", (e) => {
  console.log(`${url} does not exist`);
});

script.src = url;
document.head.appendChild(script);
```

An attacker may even be able to discover a user's ID, by iteratively trying to load pages to see if pages like `https://example.org/users/my_username` exist.

### Frame counting using window references

In a frame counting attack, the attacker finds out the number of frames currently loaded in the target page. In turn, that leaks information about the state of the target site, which may enable to attacker to learn, for example, whether the user is currently logged into the site.

If an attacker site gets a reference to a {{domxref("Window")}} object containing the target site, the attacker can count the number of frames in the target site by reading the {{domxref("Window.length", "window.length")}} property.

The attacker can get a `Window` object by calling {{domxref("Window.open()", "window.open()")}}:

```js
const target = window.open("https://example.org");
const frames = target.length;
```

Alternatively, the attacker can embed the target site in an {{htmlelement("iframe")}}, and retrieve the frame's {{domxref("HTMLIFrameElement.contentWindow", "contentWindow")}} property:

```html
<iframe src="https://example.org"></iframe>
```

```js
const target = document.querySelector("iframe").contentWindow;
const frames = target.length;
```

### Leaking redirects with a CSP

In some websites, the server will redirect a request, or not, based on whether the user is signed in (or has some special status on the site). For example, imagine a site which shows administrators a page at `https://admin.example.org/`. If the user is not signed in, and requests this page, then the server might redirect them to `https://login.example.org/`.
This means that if an attacker could determine whether an attempt to load `https://admin.example.org/` led to a redirect, then they know whether the user is an administrator on the site.

In the attack described here, the attacker uses the [Content Security Policy (CSP)](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP) feature to detect whether a cross-site request was redirected.

- First, they create a page governed by a CSP that only allows {{htmlelement("iframe")}} elements to contain content from `https://admin.example.org/`.

- Next, they add an event listener in the page that listens for the {{domxref("Document.securitypolicyviolation_event", "securitypolicyviolation")}} event.

- Finally, they create an {{htmlelement("iframe")}} element and set its `src` attribute to `https://admin.example.org/`.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta
      http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
      content="frame-src https://admin.example.org/" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <script>
      document.addEventListener("securitypolicyviolation", () => {
        console.log("Page was redirected");
      });
      const frame = document.createElement("iframe");
      document.body.appendChild(frame);
      frame.src = "https://admin.example.org/";
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

- If the user is logged in as an admin, then the `<iframe>` will load, and the browser will not fire `securitypolicyviolation`.
- If the user is not logged in as admin, the server redirects to `https://login.example.org/`. Because this URL is not allowed by the attacker's CSP, the browser will block the `<iframe>` and fire the `securitypolicyviolation` event, and the attacker's event handler will run.

Note that this attack works even if the target site disallows embedding using a mechanism such as [`frame-ancestors`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/frame-ancestors).

## Defenses against cross-site leaks

Cross-site leaks exploit mechanisms in the web platform which enables websites to interact with each other. Correspondingly, the defenses against cross-site leaks usually involve _isolating_ the target website from potential attackers, by disabling or controlling these cross-site interactions.

Since cross-site leaks can work in many different ways, there isn't a single defense that will work against all of them. However, there are several practices that will work against many of them, and we will summarize them here.

### Fetch metadata

{{glossary("Fetch metadata request header", "Fetch metadata")}} is the term used for a collection of HTTP request headers which provide information about the context of an HTTP request, including:

- {{httpheader("Sec-Fetch-Site")}}: Whether the request is same-origin, same-site, or cross-site.
- {{httpheader("Sec-Fetch-Mode")}}: The request's {{domxref("Request.mode", "mode")}}.
- {{httpheader("Sec-Fetch-User")}}: Whether the request is a user-initiated navigation.
- {{httpheader("Sec-Fetch-Dest")}}: The request's {{domxref("Request.destination", "destination")}}.

Fetch metadata headers are not a defense mechanism on their own, but enable a server to implement a policy which will deny requests that are used in cross-site leaks as well as other attacks such as [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/CSRF) attacks.

For example, the [Leaking page existence using error events](#leaking_page_existence_using_error_events) attack depends on the attacker being able to make cross-site requests to load, as resources, pages that belong to the target:

```js
// Attempt to load a page in the target as a resource
const script = document.createElement("script");
script.src = "https://example.org/admin";
document.head.appendChild(script);
```

A server can use Fetch metadata to deny these requests, as in the following [Express](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side/Express_Nodejs) code:

```js
function isAllowed(req) {
  // Allow same-origin, same-site, and user-initiated requests
  const secFetchSite = req.headers["sec-fetch-site"];
  if (
    secFetchSite === "same-origin" ||
    secFetchSite === "same-site" ||
    secFetchSite === "none"
  ) {
    return true;
  }

  // Allow cross-site navigations, such as clicking links
  const secFetchMode = req.headers["sec-fetch-mode"];
  if (secFetchMode === "navigate" && req.method === "GET") {
    return true;
  }

  // Deny everything else
  return false;
}

app.get("/admin", (req, res) => {
  res.setHeader("Vary", "sec-fetch-site, sec-fetch-mode");
  if (isAllowed(req)) {
    // Respond with the admin page if the user is admin
    getAdminPage(req, res);
  } else {
    res.status(404).send("Not found.");
  }
});
```

Since the attacker's request is cross-site and is not a navigation, then this server always returns an error for it, whether the user is signed in or not.

Note that we also send the {{httpheader("Vary")}} response header. This ensures that if the response is cached, the cached response will only be given to requests with the same values for the Fetch metadata headers we are using.

A policy like this is called a _Resource Isolation Policy_. To learn much more about implementing isolation policies with Fetch metadata, see [Protect your resources from web attacks with Fetch Metadata](https://web.dev/articles/fetch-metadata) and [Isolation Policies](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/defenses/isolation-policies/).

### SameSite cookies

The [`SameSite`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Set-Cookie#samesitesamesite-value) cookie attribute determines whether or not the cookie will be sent in requests originating from a different site.

The `Lax` value of `SameSite` means that cross-site requests will only include the cookie if the request is a top-level navigation (meaning, essentially, that the value in the browser's address bar changes to the target site) and uses a {{glossary("Safe/HTTP", "safe")}} method (most notably, this excludes {{httpmethod("POST")}} requests).

This can protect against some cross-site leaks. For example, the [Leaking page existence using error events](#leaking_page_existence_using_error_events) attack depends on the attacker making cross-site resource requests that include the user's session cookies. Setting `SameSite` to `Lax` on the user's session cookie would prevent this attack, because the cookie would not be included in the attacker's request, and no pages that require a login would ever be returned.

As a rule, `SameSite` should be treated as a defense in depth measure, and should be deployed as well as a more explicit isolation policy such as one based on Fetch metadata.

### Framing protection

Many cross-site leaks rely on the attacking site being able to embed the target as an {{htmlelement("iframe")}}. For example, this is one method an attacker can use to get a reference to the target's {{domxref("Window", "window")}}, to enable a [frame-counting](#frame_counting_using_window_references) attack.

This means it is a good practice to prevent a site from being embeddable unless you need to allow embedding, and if you do need to allow embedding, restrict it as far as you can.

There are two relevant tools here:

- The [`frame-ancestors` directive](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP#clickjacking_protection) in a [content security policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP).
- The {{httpheader("X-Frame-Options")}} response header.

The `frame-ancestors` directive is a replacement for `X-Frame-Options`. Although [browser support for `frame-ancestors` is very good](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/frame-ancestors#browser_compatibility), some very old browsers, notably Internet Explorer, don't support `frame-ancestors`.

If `frame-ancestors` and `X-Frame-Options` are both set, then browsers that support `frame-ancestors` will ignore `X-Frame-Options`. This means that there's no reason not to set `X-Frame-Options` as well as `frame-ancestors`, and thus prevent embedding even in browsers that don't support `frame-ancestors`.

### Cross-Origin Opener Policy (COOP)

As we saw in the [frame-counting](#frame_counting_using_window_references) attack, another way to get a reference to the target's {{domxref("Window", "window")}} is as the return value of a call to {{domxref("Window.open()", "window.open()")}}:

```js
const target = window.open("https://example.com");
```

The {{httpheader("Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy")}} response header determines whether a document will be opened in the same {{glossary("Browsing context", "browsing context group")}} as the document that opened it.

If your server sends this header and sets it to any value except the default of `"unsafe-none"`, then if a document from a different origin tries to open your page using `window.open()`, your page will be loaded into a different browsing context group. Among other things, this means that the opener will not get a reference to the `window` object for your page, and will therefore not be able to use it in a frame counting attack.

### Defense summary checklist

As we've seen, cross-site leaks include a range of attacks targeting different parts of the web platform: a single defense doesn't work against any of them. Indeed, some leaks, such as the one that exploits CSP to leak redirects, don't have any defenses yet.

In this guide we've outlined a few defenses that help to isolate your site from potential attackers, and we recommend implementing all of them:

- Use Fetch metadata to implement a resource isolation policy.
- Set the `SameSite` attribute for session cookies to `Strict` if you can, or `Lax` if you have to.
- Use the `frame-ancestors` CSP directive and the `X-Frame-Options` response header to prevent your site being embedded, or to control which sites can embed your site.
- Send the `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` response header to prevent other sites from accessing your `window` global object.

# Cross-site scripting (XSS)

A cross-site scripting (XSS) attack is one in which an attacker is able to get a target site to execute malicious code as though it was part of the website.

## Overview

A web browser downloads code from many different websites and runs it on the user's computer. Some of these websites will be highly trustworthy, and the user may use them for sensitive operations, such as financial transactions or medical advice. With others, such as a casual gaming site, the user may have no such trust relationship. The foundation of the browser's security model is that these sites should be kept separate from each other, so code from one site should not be able to access objects or {{glossary("credential", "credentials")}} in another site. This is called the [same-origin policy](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy).

![Diagram of 2 sites in the browsers, in separate worlds](same-origin.svg)

In a successful XSS attack, the attacker is able to subvert the same-origin policy by tricking the target site into executing malicious code within its own context, as though it were same-origin. The code can then do anything that the site's own code can do, including, for example:

- Access and/or modify all the content of the site's loaded pages, and any content in local storage
- Make HTTP requests with the user's credentials, enabling them to impersonate the user or access sensitive data

![Diagram of attacker code running in target website](xss.svg)

All XSS attacks depend on a website doing two things:

1. Accepting some input that could have been crafted by an attacker
2. Including this input in a page without _sanitizing_ it: that is, without ensuring that it won't be executable as JavaScript.

## Two XSS examples

In this section we'll go through two example pages that are vulnerable to an XSS attack.

### Code injection in the browser

In this example, suppose the website for the user's bank is `my-bank.example.com`. The user is typically signed into it, and code in the website can access the user's account details and perform transactions. The website wants to display a welcome message, personalized for the current user. It displays the welcome in a {{htmlelement("Heading_Elements", "heading")}} element:

```html
<h1 id="welcome"></h1>
```

The page expects to find the current user's name in a [URL parameter](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_URL#parameters). It extracts the parameter value, and uses the value to create a personalized greeting message:

```js
const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const user = params.get("user");
const welcome = document.querySelector("#welcome");

welcome.innerHTML = `Welcome back, ${user}!`;
```

Let's say this page is served from `https://my-bank.example.com/welcome`. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker sends the user a link like this:

```html
<a
  href="https://my-bank.example.com/welcome?user=<img src=x onerror=alert('hello!')>">
  Get a free kitten!</a
>
```

When the user clicks the link:

1. The browser loads the page.
2. The page extracts the URL parameter named `user`, whose value is `<img src=x onerror=alert("hello!")>`.
3. The page then assigns this value to the `welcome` element's `innerHTML` property, which creates a new {{htmlelement("img")}} element, which has a `src` attribute value of `x`.
4. Since the `src` value generates an error, the `onerror` [event handler property](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Events#inline_event_handlers_%e2%80%94_dont_use_these) is executed, and the attacker gets to run its code in the page.

In this case the code just displays an alert, but in a real banking website, the attacker code would be able to do anything that the bank's own front-end code could.

### Code injection in the server

In this example, consider a website with a search function. The HTML for the search page might look like this:

```html
<h1>Search</h1>

<form action="/results">
  <label for="mySearch">Search for an item:</label>
  <input id="mySearch" type="search" name="search" />
  <input type="submit" />
</form>
```

When the user enters a search term and clicks "Submit", the browser makes a GET request to "/results", including the search term as a URL parameter, like this:

```plain
https://example.org/results?search=bananas
```

The server wants to display a list of search results, with a title indicating what the user searched for. It extracts the search term from the URL parameter. Here's what this might look like in [Express](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side/Express_Nodejs):

```js
app.get("/results", (req, res) => {
  const searchQuery = req.query.search;
  const results = getResults(searchQuery); // Implementation not shown
  res.send(`
   <h1>You searched for ${searchQuery}</h1>
   <p>Here are the results: ${results}</p>`);
});
```

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker sends the user a link like this:

```html
<a href="http://example.org/results?search=<img src=x onerror=alert('hello')">
  Get a free kitten!</a
>
```

When the user clicks the link:

1. The browser sends a GET request to the server. The request's URL parameter contains the malicious code.
2. The server extracts the URL parameter value and embeds it in the page.
3. The server returns the page to the browser, which runs it.

## Anatomy of an XSS attack

Like all XSS attacks, these two examples are possible because the website:

1. Uses input that could have been crafted by an attacker
2. Includes the input in the page without sanitizing it.

Both these examples use the same vector for the malicious input: the URL parameter. However, there are other vectors that attackers can use.

For example, consider a blog with comments. In a case like this, the website:

1. Allows anyone to submit comments using a {{htmlelement("form")}} element
2. Stores the comments in a database
3. Includes the comments in pages that the website serves to other users.

If the comments are not sanitized, then they are potential vectors for XSS. This kind of attack is sometimes called _stored_ or _persistent_ XSS, and is particularly severe, because the infected content will be served to all users who access the page, every time they access it.

### Client and server XSS

One big difference between the two examples is that the malicious code is injected in different parts of the website's codebase, and this is a reflection of each website's architecture.

A website that uses client-side rendering, such as an {{glossary("SPA", "single-page app")}}, modifies pages in the browser, using web APIs such as {{domxref("document.createElement()")}} to do so, either directly, or indirectly through a framework like React. It's in the course of this process that XSS injection will happen. That's what we see in the first example: the malicious code is injected in the browser, by a script running in the page assigning the URL parameter value to the {{domxref("Element.innerHTML")}} property, which interprets its value as HTML code.

A website that uses server-side rendering builds pages on the server, using a framework like Django or Express, most commonly by inserting values into page templates. XSS injection, if it happens, will happen in the server during the templating process. That's what we see in the second example: the code is injected in the server, by the Express code inserting the URL parameter value into the document it's returning. The XSS attack code then runs when the browser evaluates the page.

In both cases, the general approach to defense is the same, and we'll go into this in detail in the next section. However, the specific tools and APIs you'll use will be different.

## Defenses against XSS

If you need to include external input in your site's pages, there are two main defenses against XSS:

1. Use _output encoding_ and _sanitization_ to prevent input from becoming executable. If you're rendering content in the browser, you can use the [Trusted Types API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Trusted_Types_API) to ensure that input is being passed through a sanitization function before being included in the page.
2. Use a [Content Security Policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP) (CSP) to tell the browser which JavaScript or CSS resources it should be allowed to execute. This is a backup defense: if the first defense fails and executable input makes it into a page, then a properly configured CSP should prevent the browser from executing it.

### Output encoding

_Output encoding_ is the process by which characters in the input string that potentially make it dangerous are escaped, so they are treated as text instead of being treated as part of a language like HTML.

This is the appropriate choice when you want to treat input as text, for example, because your website uses templates that interpolate input into content, as in this [Django template](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/templates/language/) excerpt:

```django
<p>You searched for \{{ search_term }}.</p>
```

Most modern templating engines automatically perform output encoding. For example, Django's templating engine performs the following conversions:

- `<` is converted to `&lt;`

- `>` is converted to `&gt;`

- `'` is converted to `&#x27;`

- `"` is converted to `&quot;`

- `&` is converted to `&amp;`

This means that if you pass `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS!')>` into the Django template above, it will be converted to `&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(&#x27;XSS!&#x27;)&gt;`, which is displayed as the following text:

> You searched for &lt;img src=x onerror=alert('XSS!')&gt;.

Similarly, if you're doing client-side rendering with React, values embedded in JSX are automatically encoded. For example, consider a JSX component like this:

```jsx
import React from "react";

export function App(props) {
  return <div>Hello, {props.name}!</div>;
}
```

If we pass `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS!')>` into `props.name`, it will be rendered as:

> Hello, &lt;img src=x onerror=alert('XSS!')&gt;!

One of the most important parts of preventing XSS attacks is to use a well-regarded templating engine which performs robust output encoding, and read its documentation to understand any caveats about the protection it offers.

#### Document contexts

Even if you're using a templating engine which automatically encodes HTML, you need to be aware of where in the document you are including untrusted content. For example, suppose you have a Django template like this:

```django
<div>\{{ my_input }}</div>
```

In this context, the input is inside `<div>` tags, so the browser evaluates it as HTML. So you need to protect against the case where `my_input` is HTML that defines executable code, such as `<img src=x onerror="alert('XSS')">`. The output encoding built into Django prevents this attack, by encoding characters like `<` and `>` as the HTML entities `&lt;` and `&gt;`.

However, suppose the template is like this:

```django
<div \{{ my_input }}></div>
```

In this context the browser will treat the `my_input` variable as an HTML attribute. Because Django encodes quotes (`"` → `&quot;`, `'` → `&#x27;`), the payload `onmouseover="alert('XSS')"` will not execute.
However, an unquoted payload like `onmouseover=alert(1)` (or using backticks, ``onmouseover=alert(`XSS`)``) will still execute, because attribute values need not be quoted and backticks are not escaped by default.

The browser uses different rules to process different parts of a web page — HTML elements and their content, HTML attributes, inline styles, inline scripts. The type of encoding that needs to be done is different depending on the context in which the input is being interpolated.

What's safe in one context may be unsafe in another, and it's necessary to understand the context in which you are including untrusted content, and to implement any special handling that this demands.

- **HTML contexts**: input inserted between the tags of most HTML elements (except for {{htmlelement("style")}} or {{htmlelement("script")}}) is interpreted as HTML. The encoding applied by template engines is mostly concerned with this context.
- **HTML attribute contexts**: inserting input as HTML attribute values is sometimes safe and sometimes not, depending on the attribute. In particular, event handler attributes like `onblur` are unsafe, as is the [`src`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/iframe#src) attribute of the {{htmlelement("iframe")}} element.

  It's also important to quote placeholders for inserted attribute values, or an attacker may be able to insert an additional unsafe attribute in the value provided. For example, this template does not quote an inserted value:

  ```django example-bad
  <div class=\{{ my_class }}>...</div>
  ```

  An attacker can exploit this to inject an event handler attribute, by using input like `some_id onmouseover=alert(1)`. To prevent the attack, quote the placeholder:

  ```django example-good
    <div class="\{{ my_class }}">...</div>
  ```

- **JavaScript and CSS contexts**: inserting input inside {{htmlelement("script")}} or {{htmlelement("style")}} tags is almost always unsafe.

### Sanitization

Templating engines typically allow developers to disable output encoding. This is necessary when developers want to insert untrusted content as HTML, not text. For example, in Django, the [`safe`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/templates/language/#how-to-turn-it-off) filter disables output encoding, and in React, [`dangerouslySetInnerHTML`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/common#dangerously-setting-the-inner-html) has the same effect.

In this case it's up to the developer to ensure that the content is safe, by sanitizing it.

_Sanitization_ is the process of removing unsafe features from a string of HTML: for example, {{htmlelement("script")}} tags or inline event handlers. Since sanitization, like output encoding, is difficult to get right, it's advisable to use a reputable third-party library for it. [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) is recommended by many experts including [OWASP](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#html-sanitization).

For example, consider a string of HTML like:

```html
<div>
  <img src="x" onerror="alert('hello!')" />
  <script>
    alert("hello!");
  </script>
</div>
```

If we pass this to DOMPurify, it will return:

```html
<div>
  <img src="x" />
</div>
```

### Trusted types

Having a function that can sanitize a given input string is one thing, but finding all the places in a codebase where input strings need to be sanitized can in itself be a very hard problem.

If you're implementing client-side rendering in the browser, there are a number of Web APIs that are unsafe if called with unsanitized untrusted content.

For example, the following APIs interpret their string arguments as HTML and use it to update the page DOM:

- {{domxref("Element.innerHTML")}} (which is also used internally by React's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`)
- {{domxref("Element.outerHTML")}}
- {{domxref("Element.insertAdjacentHTML()")}}
- {{domxref("Document.write()")}}

Other APIs directly execute their arguments as JavaScript. For example:

- [`eval()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval)
- {{domxref("Window.setTimeout()")}} and {{domxref("Window.setInterval()")}}

The [Trusted Types API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Trusted_Types_API) enables a developer to be sure that input is always sanitized before being passed to one of these APIs.

The key to enforcing the use of trusted types is the [`require-trusted-types-for`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/require-trusted-types-for) CSP directive. If this directive is set, then passing string arguments to unsafe APIs will throw an exception:

```js example-bad
const userInput = "I might be XSS";
const element = document.querySelector("#container");

element.innerHTML = userInput; // Throws a TypeError
```

Instead, a developer must pass a _trusted type_ to one of these APIs. A trusted type is an object created from a string by a {{domxref("TrustedTypePolicy")}} object, whose implementation is defined by the developer. For example:

```js example-good
// Create a policy that can create TrustedHTML values
// by sanitizing the input strings with DOMPurify library.
const sanitizer = trustedTypes.createPolicy("my-policy", {
  createHTML: (input) => DOMPurify.sanitize(input),
});

const userInput = "I might be XSS";
const element = document.querySelector("#container");

const trustedHTML = sanitizer.createHTML(userInput);
element.innerHTML = trustedHTML;
```

> [!NOTE]
> The Trusted Types API does not provide a sanitization function: it is a framework in which a developer can be sure that a sanitization function that they provide has been called. In the example above, the developer uses DOMPurify as the sanitizer for HTML sinks, within the Trusted Types framework.

The Trusted Types API does not yet have good cross-browser support, but when it does it will be an important defense against DOM-based XSS attacks.

### Deploying a CSP

Output encoding and sanitization are all about preventing malicious scripts from getting into a site's pages. One of the main functions of a content security policy is to prevent malicious scripts from being executed even if they are in a site's pages. That is, it is a backup in case the other defenses fail.

The recommended approach to mitigating XSS with a CSP is a [strict CSP](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP#strict_csp), which uses a [nonce](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP#nonces) or a [hash](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP#hashes) to indicate to the browser which scripts it expects to see in the document. If an attacker manages to insert malicious `<script>` elements, then they won't have the correct nonce or hash, and the browser will not execute them. Additionally, various common XSS vectors are disallowed completely: inline event handlers, `javascript:` URLs, and APIs like `eval()` that execute their arguments as JavaScript.

### Defense summary checklist

We can summarize the defenses above as follows:

- When interpolating input into a page, either in the browser or in the server, use a templating engine that performs output encoding.
- Be aware of the context in which you are interpolating input, and ensure that the appropriate output encoding will be performed in that context.
- If you need to include input as HTML, sanitize it using a reputable library. If you're doing this in the browser, use the trusted types framework to ensure that input is being processed by your sanitization function.
- Implement a strict CSP.

# Certificate Transparency

**Certificate Transparency** is an open framework designed to protect against and monitor for certificate mis-issuances. With certificate transparency, newly-issued certificates are 'logged' to publicly-run, often independent _CT logs_ — which maintain an append-only, cryptographically-assured record of issued TLS certificates.

In this way, certificate authorities (CAs) can be subject to much greater public scrutiny and oversight. Potentially malicious certificates, such as those that violate the CA/B Forum _Baseline Requirements_, can be detected and revoked much more quickly. Browser vendors and root store maintainers are also empowered to make more informed decisions regarding problematic CAs that they may decide to distrust.

## Background

CT logs are built upon the foundation of the _Merkle tree_ data structure. Nodes are labelled with the _cryptographic hashes_ of their child nodes. Leaf nodes contain hashes of actual pieces of data. The label of the root node therefore depends on all other nodes in the tree.

In the context of certificate transparency, the data hashed by the leaf nodes are the certificates that have been issued by the various different CAs operating today. Certificate inclusion can be verified via an _audit proof_ which can be generated and verified efficiently, in logarithmic O(log n) time.

Certificate transparency initially came about in 2013 against a backdrop of CA compromises (DigiNotar breach in 2011), questionable decisions (Trustwave subordinate root incident in 2012) and technical issuance issues (weak, 512-bit certificate issuance by DigiCert Sdn Bhd of Malaysia).

## Implementation

When certificates are submitted to a CT log, a _signed certificate timestamp_ (SCT) is generated and returned. This serves as a proof that the certificate has been submitted and will be added to the log.

The specification states that compliant servers _must_ provide a number of these SCTs to TLS clients when they connect. This can be accomplished via a number of different mechanisms:

- X.509v3 certificate extension which embeds signed certificate timestamps directly into the leaf certificate
- A TLS extension of type `signed_certificate_timestamp` sent during the handshake
- OCSP stapling (that is, the `status_request` TLS extension) and providing a `SignedCertificateTimestampList` with one or more SCTs

With the X.509 certificate extension, the included SCTs are decided by the issuing CA. Since June 2021, most actively used and valid publicly-trusted certificates contain transparency data embedded in this extension. This method should not require web servers to be modified.

With the latter methods, servers will need to be updated to send the required data. The advantage is that the server operator can customize the CT log sources providing the SCTs sent via the TLS extension/stapled OCSP response.

## Browser Requirements

Google Chrome 107 and later requires CT log inclusion for all certificates issued with a notBefore date of after 30 April 2018. Users will be prevented from visiting sites using non-compliant TLS certificates.
Chrome had previously required CT inclusion for _Extended Validation_ (EV) and Symantec-issued certificates.

Apple [requires](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/103214) a varying number of SCTs in order for Safari and other servers to trust server certificates.

Firefox desktop from version 135 requires CT log inclusion for all certificates issued by certificate authorities in Mozilla's Root CA Program.
Firefox for Android does not currently require CT log inclusion.

## Specifications

Browser implementations are based on the obsoleted specification {{rfc("6962","Certificate Transparency")}} (January 2025).
The current specification is {{rfc("9162","Certificate Transparency Version 2.0")}}.

This document outlines a set of security guidelines that will generally apply to all client applications, such as Firefox and Thunderbird.

## Secure Coding Principles

Ensure that the application follows the [OWASP Secure Coding Principles](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Secure_Coding_Principles):

1. Minimize attack surface area
2. Establish secure defaults
3. Principle of Least privilege
4. Principle of Defense in depth
5. Fail securely
6. Don't trust services
7. Keep security simple
8. Fix security issues correctly

## Input Validation

## URLs

1. Does the application make use of untrusted data to construct URLs?
   - Ensure any such data is adequately sanitized and encoded prior to use.
   - Ensure any data obtained from these URLs is checked before use or storage.

2. Does the application follow redirects?
   - Ensure security checks are performed on redirects as well as the original request URI.

## Security Controls

1. Does the application implement suitable permission checks?
   - Ensure the correct APIs are used where available (e.g., shouldLoad, etc.)
   - Ensure the application fails securely.

## Remote System Access

1. Does the application access any remote systems?

- Ensure that TLS is used unless there's a _very_ good reason not to.
- Ensure that no user information is transmitted without the user's consent.

## Information Storage

1. File storage
   1. Ensure the application checks that any files created are under allowed paths
   2. Are filenames generated from untrusted data?
      - Ensure the data is suitably encoded

   3. Check files are of an acceptable type
   4. Check files cannot exceed reasonable size limits

2. Database storage
   1. Ensure any untrusted information sent to the database is adequately sanitized
   2. Where possible, make use of type safe parameterization to prevent injection attacks

3. Sensitive information
   1. Ensure any security sensitive or personal information is adequately protected (see Encryption section)
   2. Particular care must be taken around credentials (passwords, etc.) - If you're working with information of this type and you're unsure of what to do, it's always worth asking

4. Logging
   1. Don't forget the above rules apply to logs as well as your usual application data

## Encryption

1. Does the application use any form of encryption?
2. Are the algorithms used recognized standards?

## Denial of Service

1. Ensure the application protects against exhaustion of:
   1. System memory
   2. Storage

## Security Warnings

1. Does the application present the user with any security warnings?
2. Are they clearly understandable and appropriate?
3. Can untrusted data change the meaning of messages to the user?
   - Can user input change the meaning of messages?
   - Can user input force system messages off the visible screen?
   - Can user input include special characters that can change the meaning of messages (e.g., Unicode right-to-left override U+202E)

4. Can an attacker use the timing of dialogs to fool the user into clicking on something they didn't intend to?

## Information Disclosure

1. Does the application disclose information that could compromise the user?
2. Does the application disclose any information that it does not need to?
3. Does the application disclose anything that may surprise or upset the user?

## Front End

1. Are safe mechanisms used to create XUL and HTML UI elements?
   - e.g., use createTextNode instead of innerHTML or similar

2. Does the application create its own docshells (tabs, iframes)?
   - Ensure you are explicit about the type of these, e.g., iframe.setAttribute("type", "content")

# IFrame credentialless

{{SeeCompatTable}}

**IFrame credentialless** provides a mechanism for developers to load third-party resources in {{htmlelement("iframe")}}s using a new, ephemeral context. It doesn't have access to its regular origin's network, cookies, and storage data. It uses a new context local to the top-level document lifetime. In return, the {{httpheader("Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy")}} (COEP) embedding rules can be lifted, so documents with COEP set can embed third-party documents that do not.

## The problem

Various web API features can only be used on sites that opt in to cross-origin isolation — examples include {{jsxref("SharedArrayBuffer")}} and {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp", "high-resolution timers", "", "nocode")}}. This is because of the risk of such features being exploited in [Spectre attacks](https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf), where a victim's confidential information can be leaked via a side channel and captured by an attacker.

To opt in to cross-origin isolation, a resource must be served with a {{httpheader("Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy")}} with a value of `same-origin` (protects your origin from attackers) and {{httpheader("Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy")}} with a value of `credentialless` or `require-corp` (protects victims from your origin). The latter prevents a document from loading any credentialled cross-origin resources that don't explicitly grant the document permission using {{httpheader("Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy")}} or [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS).

The key issue limiting the adoption of cross-origin isolation is the fact that `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` is applied recursively — any third-party content loaded into `<iframe>`s in a document with a `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` set must also deploy `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` for the embedding to succeed. This is a problem for developers embedding third-party content in their apps (such as ad-network content) as they generally have no control over it — their only choice up to now has been to wait for the third-party content providers to implement `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy`.

This problem can be solved by IFrame credentialless.

## The solution — Iframe credentialless

An `<iframe>` is made credentialless by applying the [`credentialless`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/iframe#credentialless) attribute to it, or setting the equivalent DOM property — {{domxref("HTMLIFrameElement.credentialless")}} — to `true`.

```html
<iframe
  src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)"
  title="Spectre vulnerability Wikipedia page"
  width="960"
  height="600"
  credentialless></iframe>
```

Or:

```html
<iframe width="960" height="600"> </iframe>
```

```js
const iframeElem = document.querySelector("iframe");

iframeElem.credentialless = true;
iframeElem.title = "Spectre vulnerability Wikipedia page";
iframeElem.src =
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)";
```

> [!NOTE]
> The {{domxref("window.credentialless")}} property can be queried by a document embedded in an `<iframe>` to test whether it is being run in a credentialless context. A value of `true` means the embedding `<iframe>` is credentialless.

This results in the documents inside the credentialless `<iframe>` being loaded using new, ephemeral contexts — those contexts don't have access to the data associated with their origins; for example [cookies](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Cookies) and [localStorage](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage). The credentialless storage is partitioned out separately with storage keys modified by a nonce ("number used once") value, set once per top-level document. So a cookie set in one credentialless `<iframe>` will be accessible only from other same-origin credentialless `<iframe>`s embedded below the same top-level document.

The nonce is shared for every credentialless iframe that is a descendant of the same top-level document, but it is different for each distinct top-level document the user navigates to, and no longer accessible once the user has navigated away. Credentialless IFrames do not share storage across different pages. Returning to the cookie mentioned above, reloading the document will load the credentialless `<iframe>`s in a different context, so none of the previously-set cookies will be available.

In addition:

- Pop-ups opened by credentialless iframes are opened with [`rel="noopener"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel/noopener) set. This prevents OAuth pop-up flows from being used in credentialless iframes.
- Browser autofill or password manager functionality is unavailable in credentialless `<iframe>`s.

The result of this is that documents loaded into credentialless `<iframe>`s are effectively vanilla or "public" versions, not customized with any user's sensitive information. Since there is no sensitive information available to leak from these documents, they are of no use to would-be attackers, and so the Cross-Origin Embedder Policy requirement is dropped for those IFrames.

## Recursive credentialless inside child IFrames

If `credentialless` is set on an `<iframe>` that has child `<iframe>`s embedded in the document loaded inside it, those child `<iframe>`s inherit the credentialless setting.

# Security on the web

Websites contain several different types of information. Some of it is non-sensitive, for example the copy shown on the public pages. Some of it is sensitive, for example customer usernames, passwords, and banking information, or internal algorithms and private product information.

Sensitive information needs to be protected, and that is the focus of web security. If that information fell into the wrong hands, it could be used to:

- Put companies at a competitive disadvantage by sharing their information with competitors.
- Disable or hijack their services, again causing serious problems with their operation.
- Put their customer's [privacy](/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy) at risk, making them vulnerable to profiling, targeting, loss of data, identity theft, or even financial loss.

Modern browsers already have several features to protect users' security on the web, but developers also need to use best practices and code carefully to ensure that their websites are secure. Even simple bugs in your code can result in vulnerabilities that bad actors can exploit to steal data and gain unauthorized control over services.

This article provides an introduction to web security, including conceptual information to help you understand website vulnerabilities and practical guides on how to secure them.

## Relationship between security and privacy

Security and privacy are distinct yet closely related topics. It is worth knowing the differences between the two and how they relate.

- **Security** is the act of keeping private data and systems protected against unauthorized access. This includes both company (internal) data and user and partner (external) data.

- **Privacy** refers to the act of giving users control over how their data is collected, stored, and used, while also ensuring that it is not used irresponsibly. For example, you should let your users know what data you are collecting from them, the parties with whom it will be shared, and how it will be used. Users must be given a chance to consent to your privacy policy, have access to their data you store, and delete it if they choose to.

Good security is essential for good privacy. You could follow all the advice listed in our [Privacy on the web](/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy) guide, but acting with integrity and having a robust privacy policy are futile if your site is not secure and attackers can just steal data anyway.

## Security features provided by browsers

Web browsers follow a strict security model that enforces strong security for content, connections between the browser and the server, and data transportation. This section looks at the features that underpin this model.

### Same-origin policy and CORS

[Same-origin policy](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) is a fundamental security mechanism of the web that restricts how a document or a script loaded from one {{Glossary("origin")}} can interact with a resource from another origin. It helps isolate potentially malicious documents, reducing possible attack vectors.

In general, documents from one origin cannot make requests to other origins. This makes sense because you don't want sites to be able to interfere with one another and access unauthorized data.

However, you might want to relax this restriction in some circumstances; for example, if you have multiple websites that interact with each other, you may allow them to request resources from one another using [`fetch()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/fetch). This can be permitted using [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS), an HTTP-header-based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.

### HTTP model for communication

The [HTTP](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) protocol is used by web browsers and servers to communicate with one another, request resources, provide responses (for example, providing a requested resource or detailing why a request failed), and provide security features for that communication.

Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides security and privacy by encrypting data during transport over the network and is the technology behind the [HTTPS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTPS) protocol. TLS is good for privacy because it stops third parties from being able to intercept transmitted data and use it maliciously.

All browsers are moving towards requiring HTTPS by default; this is practically the case already because you can't do much on the web without this protocol.

Related topics:

- [Transport layer security](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Transport_Layer_Security) (TLS)
  - : The TLS protocol is the standard for enabling two networked applications or devices to exchange information privately and robustly. Applications that use TLS can choose their security parameters, which can have a substantial impact on the security and reliability of data.
- [HTTP Strict-Transport-Security](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security)
  - : The `Strict-Transport-Security` [HTTP](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) header lets a website specify that it may only be accessed using HTTPS.
- [Certificate Transparency](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Certificate_Transparency)
  - : Certificate Transparency (CT) is an open framework designed to protect against and monitor for certificate misissuance. Newly issued certificates are 'logged' to publicly run, often independent CT logs. These provide append-only, cryptographically assured records of issued TLS certificates.
- [Mixed content](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content)
  - : An HTTPS page that includes content fetched using [cleartext](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Plaintext) HTTP is called a **mixed content** page. Pages like this are only partially encrypted, leaving the unencrypted content accessible to sniffers and man-in-the-middle attackers.
- [Weak signature algorithms](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Weak_Signature_Algorithm)
  - : The strength of the hash algorithm used in {{Glossary("Signature/Security", "signing")}} a {{Glossary("digital certificate")}} is a critical element of the security of the certificate. Some signature algorithms are known to be weak, and should be avoided when appropriate.

### Secure contexts and feature permissions

Browsers control the usage of "powerful features" in different ways. These "powerful features" include generating system notifications on a website, using a user's webcam to get access to a media stream, manipulating the system GPU, and using web payments. If a site could just use the APIs that control such features without restriction, malicious developers could attempt to do the following:

- Annoy users with unneeded notifications and other UI features.
- Turn their webcam on without warning to spy on them.
- Clog up their browser/system to create {{glossary("denial of service", "Denial of Service")}} (DoS) attacks.
- Steal data or money.

These "powerful features" are controlled in the following ways:

- Usage of such features is permitted only in [secure contexts](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts). A secure context is a {{domxref("Window", "window")}} or a {{domxref("WorkerGlobalScope", "worker")}} for which there is reasonable confidence that the content has been delivered securely (via HTTPS/TLS). In a secure context, the potential for communication with contexts that are **not** secure is limited. Secure contexts also help to prevent [man-in-the-middle attackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) from accessing powerful features.

  To see a list of web platform features available only in secure contexts, see [Features restricted to secure contexts](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts/features_restricted_to_secure_contexts).

- The usage of these features is gated behind a system of user permissions: users have to explicitly opt-in to providing access to such features, meaning that they can't be used automatically. User permission requests happen automatically, and you can query the state of an API permission by using the [Permissions API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API).

- Several other browser features can be used only in response to a user action such as clicking a button, meaning that they need to be invoked from inside an appropriate event handler. This is called **transient activation**. See [Features gated by user activation](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/User_activation) for more information.

## High-level security considerations

There are many aspects of web security that need to be thought about on the server- and client-side. This section focuses mainly on client-side security considerations. You can find a useful summary of security from a server-side perspective, which also includes descriptions of common attacks to watch out for, at [Website security](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side/First_steps/Website_security) (part of our [Server-side website programming](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side) learning module).

### Store client-side data responsibly

Handling data responsibly is largely concerned with cutting down on [third-party cookie](/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Guides/Third-party_cookies) usage and being careful about the data you store and share with them. Traditionally, web developers have used cookies to store all kinds of data, and it has been easy for attackers to exploit this tendency. As a result, browsers have started to limit what you can do with cross-site cookies, with the aim of removing access to them altogether in the future.

You should prepare for the removal of cross-site cookies by limiting the amount of tracking activities you rely on and/or by implementing the persistence of the desired information in other ways. See [Transitioning from third-party cookies](/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Guides/Third-party_cookies#transitioning_from_third-party_cookies) and [Replacing third-party cookies](/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Guides/Third-party_cookies#replacing_third-party_cookies) for more information.

### Protect user identity and manage logins

When implementing a secure solution that involves data collection, particularly if the data is sensitive such as log-in credentials, it makes sense to use a reputable solution. For example, any respectable server-side framework will have built-in features to protect against common vulnerabilities. You could also consider using a specialized product for your purpose, for example an identity provider solution or a secure online survey provider.

If you want to roll your own solution for collecting user data, make sure you understand all aspects and requirements. Hire an experienced server-side developer and/or security engineer to implement the system, and ensure it is tested thoroughly. Use {{glossary("multi-factor authentication")}} (MFA) to provide better protection. Consider using a dedicated API such as [Web Authentication](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API) or [Federated Credential Management](/en-US/docs/Web/API/FedCM_API) to streamline the client-side of the app.

Here are some other tips for providing secure logins:

- When collecting user login information, enforce strong passwords so that your user's account details cannot be easily guessed. Weak passwords are one of the main causes of security breaches. In addition, encourage your users to use a password manager so that they can use more complex passwords, don't need to worry about remembering them, and won't create a security risk by writing them down. See also our article on [Insecure passwords](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Insecure_passwords).
- You should also educate your users about **phishing**. Phishing is the act of sending a message to a user (for example, an email or an SMS) containing a link to a site that looks like a site they use every day but isn't. The link is accompanied by a message designed to trick users into entering their username and password on the site so it can be stolen and then used by an attacker for malicious purposes.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Some phishing sites can be very sophisticated and hard to distinguish from a real website. You should therefore educate your users to not trust random links in emails and SMS messages. If they receive a message along the lines of "Urgent, you need to log in now to resolve an issue", they should go to the site directly in a new tab and try logging in directly rather than clicking the link in the message. Or they could phone or email you to discuss the message they received.

- Protect against brute force attacks on login pages with {{glossary("rate limit", "rate limiting")}}, account lockouts after a certain number of unsuccessful attempts, and [CAPTCHA challenges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA).
- Manage user login sessions with unique [session IDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_ID), and automatically log out users after periods of inactivity.

### Don't include sensitive data in URL query strings

As a general rule, you shouldn't [include sensitive data in URL query strings](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Information_exposure_through_query_strings_in_url) because if a third party intercepts the URL (for example, via the {{httpheader("Referer")}} HTTP header), they could steal that information. Even more serious is the fact that these URLs can be indexed by public web crawlers, HTTP proxies, and archiving tools such as the [internet archive](https://web.archive.org/), meaning that your sensitive data could persist on publicly accessible resources.

Use `POST` requests rather than `GET` requests to avoid these issues. Our article [Referer header policy: Privacy and security concerns](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Referer_header:_privacy_and_security_concerns) describes in more detail the privacy and security risks associated with the `Referer` header, and offers advice on mitigating those risks.

> [!NOTE]
> Steering away from transmitting sensitive data in URLs via `GET` requests can also help protect against {{glossary("CSRF", "cross-site request forgery")}} and [replay attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack).

### Enforce usage policies

Consider using web platform features like [Content Security Policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP) (CSP) and [Permissions Policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Permissions_Policy) to enforce a set of feature and resource usage rules on your website that make it harder to introduce vulnerabilities.

CSP allows you to add a layer of security by, for example, allowing images or scripts to be loaded only from specific trusted origins. This helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting ({{Glossary("Cross-site_scripting", "XSS")}}) and data injection attacks. These attacks involve a range of malicious activities, including data theft, site defacement, and distribution of malware.

Permissions policy works in a similar way, except that it is more concerned with allowing or blocking access to specific "powerful features" ([as mentioned earlier](#secure_contexts_and_feature_permissions)).

> [!NOTE]
> Such policies are very useful to help keep sites secure, especially when you are using a lot of third-party code on your site. However, keep in mind that if you block usage of a feature that a third-party script relies on to work, you may end up breaking your site's functionality.

### Maintain data integrity

Following on from the previous section, when you allow feature and resource usage on your site, you should try to ensure that resources have not been tampered with.

Related topics:

- [Subresource integrity](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity)
  - : **Subresource Integrity** (SRI) is a security feature that enables browsers to verify that resources they fetch (for example, from a {{Glossary("CDN")}}) are delivered without unexpected manipulation. It works by allowing you to provide a cryptographic hash that a fetched resource must match.
- [HTTP Access-Control-Allow-Origin](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin)
  - : The **`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`** response header indicates whether the response can be shared with requesting code from the given {{glossary("origin")}}.
- [HTTP X-Content-Type-Options](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options)
  - : The **`X-Content-Type-Options`** response header is a marker used by the server to indicate that the [MIME types](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/MIME_types) advertised in the {{HTTPHeader("Content-Type")}} headers should not be changed and must be followed. This header is a way to opt out of [MIME type sniffing](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/MIME_types#mime_sniffing), or, in other words, to specify that the MIME types are deliberately configured.

### Sanitize form input

As a general rule, don't trust anything that users enter into forms. Filling out forms online is complicated and tedious, and it is easy for users to enter incorrect data or data in the wrong format. In addition, malicious folks are skilled in the art of entering specific strings of executable code into form fields (for example, SQL or JavaScript). If you're not careful about handling such inputs, they could either execute harmful code on your site or delete your databases. See [SQL injection](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side/First_steps/Website_security#sql_injection) for a good example of how this could happen.

To protect against this, you should thoroughly sanitize data entered into your forms:

- You should implement client-side validation to inform users when they have entered data in the wrong format. You can do this using built-in HTML form validation features, or you can write your own validation code. See [Client-side form validation](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Form_validation) for more information.
- You should use output encoding when displaying user input in an application UI to safely display data exactly as a user typed it in and avoid it being executed as code. See [Output encoding](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#output-encoding) for more information.

You can't rely on client-side validation alone for security — it should be combined with server-side validation. Client-side validation enhances the user experience by providing instant validation feedback without having to wait for a round trip to the server. However, client-side validation is easy for a malicious party to bypass (for example, by turning off JavaScript in the browser to bypass JavaScript-based validation).

Any reputable server-side framework will provide functionality for validating form submissions. In addition, a common best practice is to escape any special characters that form part of executable syntax, thereby making any entered code no longer executable and treated as plain text.

### Protect against clickjacking

In a [clickjacking](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/Clickjacking) attack, a user is fooled into clicking a UI element that performs an action different from what the user expects, often resulting in the user's confidential information being passed to a malicious third party. This risk is inherent in embedded third-party content, so make sure you trust what is being embedded into your site. Additionally, be aware that clickjacking can be combined with phishing techniques. You can read about phishing in the previous section [Protect user identity and manage logins](#protect_user_identity_and_manage_logins).

The following features can help guard against clickjacking:

- [HTTP X-Frame-Options](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/X-Frame-Options)
  - : The **`X-Frame-Options`** [HTTP](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) response header can be used to indicate whether a browser should be allowed to render a page in a [`<frame>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/frame), [`<iframe>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/iframe), [`<embed>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/embed) or [`<object>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/object). Sites can use this to avoid clickjacking attacks, by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites.
- [CSP: frame-ancestors](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/frame-ancestors)
  - : The HTTP {{HTTPHeader("Content-Security-Policy")}} (CSP) **`frame-ancestors`** directive specifies valid parents that may embed a page using {{HTMLElement("frame")}}, {{HTMLElement("iframe")}}, {{HTMLElement("object")}}, or {{HTMLElement("embed")}}.

## Practical security implementation guides

To get comprehensive instructions for implementing security features effectively on websites and to ensure you're following best practices, see our set of [Practical security implementation guides](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Practical_implementation_guides).

Some of these guides are directly related to the [HTTP Observatory](/en-US/observatory) tool. Observatory performs security audits on a website and provides a grade and score along with recommendations for fixing the security issues it finds. These guides explain how to resolve issues surfaced by the MDN Observatory tests: the tool links to the relevant guide for each issue, helping guide you towards an effective resolution. Interestingly, Mozilla's internal developer teams use this guidance when implementing websites to ensure that security best practices are applied.

# Insecure passwords

Serving login forms over HTTP is especially dangerous because of the wide variety of attacks that can be used against them to extract a user's password. Network eavesdroppers could steal a user's password by sniffing the network, or by modifying the served page in transit.

The [HTTPS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTPS) protocol is designed to protect user data from eavesdropping (confidentiality) and from modification (integrity) on the network. Websites that handle user data should use HTTPS to protect their users from attackers. If a website uses HTTP instead of HTTPS, it is trivial to steal user information (such as their login credentials). This was famously demonstrated by [Firesheep](https://codebutler.github.io/firesheep/).

To fix this issue, install and configure a [TLS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS) certificate on your server. There are various vendors offering free and paid certificates. If you are using a cloud platform, it may have its own ways of enabling HTTPS.

## Note on password reuse

Sometimes websites require username and passwords but don't actually store data that is very sensitive. For example, a news site may save which news articles a user wants to go back to and read, but not save any other data about a user. Web developers of the news site may be less motivated to secure their site and their user credentials.

Unfortunately, [password reuse is a big problem](https://specopssoft.com/blog/password-reuse-hidden-danger/). Users use the same password across multiple sites (news websites, social networks, email providers, banks). Hence, even if access to the username and password to your site doesn't seem like a huge risk to you, it is a great risk to users who have used the same username and password to log in to their bank accounts. Attackers are getting smarter; they steal username/password pairs from one site and then try reusing them on more lucrative sites.

# Mixed content

When a web page is loaded from a secure origin, over a secure channel such as {{Glossary("HTTPS")}}, the connection with the web server is encrypted, and is therefore protected from eavesdropping and modification by man-in-the-middle attacks.
If the securely loaded web page only includes images, scripts, and other resources that are also hosted on secure origins, users can be confident that the whole page is safe from these kinds of attacks.

"Mixed content" refers to securely loaded web pages that use resources to be fetched via HTTP or another insecure protocol.
This kind of web page is potentially unsafe because any resources that are sent insecurely can be viewed, possibly revealing sensitive information, and/or modified by an attacker.
Scripts are particularly dangerous because they can modify any aspect of the page, but all types of resources have some risk.
For example, images can be modified to give the user false or misleading information, or to change the apparent function of a button.

"Mixed downloads" refer to resource downloads initiated from a secure context, but fetched over an insecure connection.
These share the same risks as mixed content: downloads appear to come from a secure origin, but could have been modified or viewed en-route.

You should avoid using mixed content and mixed downloads in your websites!
Browsers mitigate the risks of mixed content by auto-upgrading image, video, and audio mixed content requests from HTTP to HTTPS, and block insecure requests for all other resource types.
They should also block _mixed downloads_ by default.

## Types of mixed content

Mixed content in a web page is divided into two categories: "upgradable content" and "blockable content".
Browsers should automatically upgrade requests for upgradable content from HTTP to HTTPS, and block requests for the blockable content.

This approach ensures that all content in a secure context is either loaded via a secure channel or blocked, which is safer for users than displaying a mix of secure and insecure content, and less disruptive than breaking web pages by blocking absolutely all insecure content.

> [!NOTE]
> Earlier versions of the specification divided mixed content into "blockable" and "optionally blockable" categories:
>
> - Blockable content types, also referred to as "active mixed content", were those that could modify other parts of the web page, such as scripts and stylesheets.
>   The potential risk if these files are modified is very high, and browsers were required to block them.
> - Optionally blockable content types, also known as "passive mixed content", were those that could not modify other content in the web page, such as images, videos, and audio files.
>   The potential risk of allowing these files was lower, so browsers could choose to block or display them, or defer the decision to the user.

The set of resource types that comprise "upgradable content" was seeded from the set of "optionally blockable" mixed content.
The expectation is that any new file types will be defined as blockable content, and some upgradable content may become blockable in future.

### Upgradable content

Upgradable content requests are those where an insecure request will automatically be upgraded to a secure request, by modifying the origin scheme from `http` to `https`.
The remote server will either respond with the resource, or a status code indicating that it was not found.

The resource types in this category are those where the blocking the request would risk of breaking significant portions of the web.
These currently correspond to the mixed content types that were previously "optionally blockable", as these are still used on some websites.

The following elements are upgradable (except where the URL host is specified as an IP address — see the following section):

- {{HTMLElement("img")}} where origin is set via `src` attribute, including SVG documents (but not when setting resources with `srcset` or `<picture>`).
- CSS image elements such as: `background-image`, `border-image`, etc.
- {{HTMLElement("audio")}} where origin is set with `src` attribute.
- {{HTMLElement("video")}} where origin is set with `src` attribute
- {{HTMLElement("source")}} where video or origin resource is set.

### Blockable content

Blockable content is defined as "all mixed content that is not upgradable".

This includes HTTP requests resulting from the following elements (this list is not exhaustive):

- {{HTMLElement("script")}} where origin is set via `src` attribute
- {{HTMLElement("link")}} where the origin is set in the `href` attribute, and includes stylesheets
- {{HTMLElement("iframe")}} where origin is set via `src` attribute
- {{domxref("Window/fetch", "fetch()")}} requests
- {{domxref("XMLHttpRequest")}} requests
- All cases in CSS where a {{CSSXref("url_value", "&lt;url&gt;")}} value is used ({{cssxref("@font-face")}}, {{cssxref("cursor")}}, {{cssxref("background-image")}}, and so forth).
- {{HTMLElement("object")}} (`data` attribute)
- {{domxref("Navigator.sendBeacon")}} (`url` attribute)
- {{HTMLElement("img")}} where origin is set via `srcset` or `<picture>`.
- Web fonts

Mixed content requests that would otherwise be upgraded are blocked if the URL's host is an IP address rather than a domain name.
So `<img src="http://example.com/image.png">` will be upgraded, but `<img src="http://93.184.215.14/image.png">` is blocked.

## Examples of mixed content requests

Mixed content requests are insecure requests for resources from a [secure context](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts):

The following examples demonstrate secure, insecure, and mixed content requests:

- `http://insecure.com` loads `http://also.insecure.com` — is not a mixed content request because both origins are insecure.
- `https://secure.com` loads `http://insecure.com` — is a mixed content request because the insecure resource `http://insecure.com` is loaded into the secure context `https://secure.com`.
- `http://insecure.com` loads `https://secure.com` in an `<iframe>`, which in turn loads `http://also.insecure.com` — loading `https://secure.com` into `http://insecure.com` is not a mixed content request (there is no restriction on loading a secure context into an insecure context).
  However loading `http://also.insecure.com` into the secure frame `https://secure.com` is a mixed content request.
- `https://secure.com` frames a `data:` URL, which loads `http://insecure.com` — this is a mixed content request, because `https://secure.com` (and hence `data:`) were securely loaded and `http://insecure.com` is insecure.

Mixed context requests can also be made from secure contexts such as plugins or workers, and will be upgraded/blocked in the same way.

Note however that navigation requests from a secure context that target insecure target top-level browsing contexts are not considered mixed content as they create a new context that will either be secure or insecure independent of the origin of the request.

### Loading locally delivered mixed-resources

Local resources are considered to be from secure origins, just like HTTPS origins.
This includes `file:` URLs, and content accessed from loopback addresses such as `http://127.0.0.1/` or `http://localhost/`.

You can load these files from secure contexts, and you will still have a secure context.
However if a local file loads insecure resource via `http:`, it would be a mixed content request.

Support for loading local content can be checked in the [Browser compatibility](#browser_compatibility) section.

## Mixed downloads

A mixed download is a resource download from a secure context over an insecure connection.
They are problematic for the same reasons as mixed content — content may be intercepted and/or modified by an attacker, and it is not obvious to users that this might happen on a secure site.

For example, the following code defines an [`<a>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/a#download) element that could be used to download the page at the insecure origin `http://example.com/`.
If this code is in a page that is served over HTTPS, saving the link results in a mixed download.

```html
<a href="http://example.com/" download>Download</a>
```

Browsers are expected to block mixed downloads, and secure sites should not include them.

> [!NOTE]
> Browsers commonly block mixed downloads by default, but inform users of the risk and allow them to keep or discard the download.

## Developer console

The developer console shows warnings when mixed content is upgraded or blocked.
These can be used to debug and fix mixed-content in your websites.

The screenshot below shows the console warning when an image is upgraded on Firefox (Chrome has a similar warning).

![Screen shot of the web console displaying upgrade warning for mixed content image.](mixed_content_console_upgradable.png)

On browser versions that still display "optionally blockable" content, an icon is used to indicate that there is mixed content in the displayed content, along with a console warning.
The screenshot below shows the icon and console warning for Firefox starting supporting upgradable mixed-content.

![Screen shot of the web console displaying display warning for mixed content image.](mixed_content_console_displayed.png)

## Fixing mixed content issues

The best strategy to avoid issues with mixed content is to serve all the content as HTTPS:

- Serve all content from your domain as HTTPS.
- Make all references to resources hosted on your domain into relative links or HTTPS links, including for downloads.
- If using resource on other sites use HTTPS versions, if available.

  Most sites provide HTTPS versions of shared resources.
  Often the easiest approach is to replace all `http://` links with `https://` and then use tools such as [LinkChecker](https://linkchecker.github.io/linkchecker/) to verify that the links all work.

There are a number of ways to verify that your site is free of mixed content including:

- Navigate your site, and check your browser's [developer console](#developer_console) for mixed content warnings.
- Disable all mixed content on your browser and test that pages work as expected.
  This is the default for Safari, but most browsers support some mechanism for blocking all mixed content (see [compatibility data](#browser_compatibility)).
- Use a desktop-based web crawler like [HTTPSChecker](https://httpschecker.net/how-it-works), or a CLI tool like [mcdetect](https://github.com/agis/mcdetect), to check your website recursively and find links to insecure content.
- Use an online tool like [Mixed Content Checker](https://www.crawlcenter.com/mixed-content-checker) to check your site.

# Secure cookie configuration

Limit access to cookies as much as possible.

## Problem

Cookies often contain session identifiers or other sensitive information. Unauthorized access to cookies, therefore, can cause a host of problems, including [privacy](/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy) issues, ({{Glossary("Cross-site_scripting", "Cross-site scripting (XSS)")}}) attacks, Cross-site request forgery ([CSRF](/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSRF)) attacks, and more.

## Solution

To minimize the scope for cookie vulnerabilities on your site, limit access to cookies as much as possible. This can be done via sensible usage of the following directives of the [`Set-Cookie`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Set-Cookie) header:

- `Name`
  - : Cookie names should be prepended with either `__Secure-` or `__Host-` to prevent cookies from being overwritten by insecure sources.
    - Use `__Host-` for all cookies needed only on a specific domain (no subdomains) where `Path` is set to `/`.
    - Use `__Secure-` for all other cookies sent from secure origins ([HTTPS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTPS)).
- `Secure`
  - : All cookies must be set with the `Secure` directive, indicating that they should only be sent over HTTPS. [HTTP Strict Transport Security](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Practical_implementation_guides/TLS#http_strict_transport_security_implementation) (HSTS) can also be used to prevent transmission over HTTP, but ideally `Secure` should be set on cookies as well.
- `HttpOnly`
  - : Cookies that don't require access from JavaScript should have the `HttpOnly` directive set to block access, such as from {{domxref("Document.cookie")}}. It is particularly important that session identifiers don't have JavaScript access, to help prevent attacks such as CSRF.
- `Expires` and `Max-Age`
  - : Cookies should expire as soon as they are no longer needed. Session identifiers in particular should expire as quickly as possible.
    - `Expires`: Sets an absolute expiration date for a given cookie.
    - `Max-Age`: Sets a relative expiration date for a given cookie.
      > [!NOTE]
      > `Expires` has been available for longer than `Max-Age`; however, `Max-Age` is less error-prone, and takes precedence when both are set. The rationale behind this is that when you set an `Expires` date and time, they're relative to the client on which the cookie is being set. If the server is set to a different time, this could cause errors.
- `Domain`
  - : Cookies should only have a `Domain` set if they need to be accessible on other domains; this should be set to the most restrictive domain possible.
- `Path`
  - : Cookies should be set to the most restrictive `Path` possible.
- `SameSite`
  - : Forbid sending cookies via cross-origin requests (for example from {{htmlelement("img")}} elements) using `SameSite`. You should use one of the following two values:
    - `SameSite=Strict`: Only send the cookie in same-site contexts (navigations and other requests). Cookies are omitted in cross-site requests (e.g., embedding images or other resources from other sites) and cross-site navigation (e.g., when following a link from a different web page). This is a very strict setting, but it does provide strong [CSRF](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/CSRF) protection, so use this value if possible.
    - `SameSite=Lax`: Send the cookie in same-site requests and when navigating _to_ your website. This should be used if `Strict` is too restrictive.

    Both of the above values are useful in protecting against [clickjacking](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/Clickjacking) attacks in cases that rely on the user being authenticated.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In theory, `SameSite=Strict` should be more useful than it is in practice. It often breaks navigations — for example, users clicking a link to a website on which they are already logged in (i.e., a valid session cookie is set) appear not to be logged in, because the browser has deliberately omitted the session cookie. The best middle ground is to use `SameSite=Strict` only on tokens where CSRF is a concern or use `SameSite=Strict` everywhere, but reload the page and do a cookie check in JavaScript if there's an indication that the user is logged in but required cookies are not being sent.

## Examples

Set a session identifier cookie that is only accessible on the current host and expires when the user closes their browser:

```http
Set-Cookie: MOZSESSIONID=980e5da39d4b472b9f504cac9; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly
```

Use the `__Secure-` prefix to set a session identifier for all `example.org` sites, set to expire after 30 days. This cookie is not sent cross-origin, but is sent when navigating to any site from another site:

```http
Set-Cookie: __Secure-MOZSESSIONID=7307d70a86bd4ab5a00499762; Max-Age=2592000; Domain=example.org; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax
```

Set a long-lived cookie for the current host, accessible by JavaScript, when the user accepts the terms of service. This cookie is sent when navigating to your site from another site, such as by clicking a link:

```http
Set-Cookie: __Host-ACCEPTEDTOS=true; Expires=Fri, 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT; Path=/; Secure; SameSite=Lax
```

Use a session identifier for a secure (HTTPS) site. It isn't sent from cross-origin requests, nor when navigating to your site from another site. When used in conjunction with other anti-CSRF measures, this provides a very strong defense for your site against CSRF attacks:

```http
Set-Cookie: __Host-BMOSESSIONID=YnVnemlsbGE=; Max-Age=2592000; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict
```

# Cross-Origin Resource Policy (CORP) implementation

Cross-Origin Resource Policy (CORP) is set by the {{httpheader("Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy")}} response header, which lets websites and applications opt-in to protection against vulnerabilities related to certain cross-origin requests (such as those made by the {{htmlelement("script")}} and {{htmlelement("img")}} elements).

## Problem

Some side-channel hardware vulnerabilities (also known as Cross-site leaks, or XS-Leaks), such as [Meltdown](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)>) and [Spectre](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)>), exploit a race condition arising as part of speculative execution functionality of modern processors. This functionality is designed to improve performance but can be manipulated to disclose sensitive data.

## Solution

Use `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy` to block [`no-cors`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RequestInit#mode) cross-origin requests to given resources. As this policy is expressed via a response header, the actual request is not prevented. Instead, the browser prevents the result from being leaked by stripping out the response body.

The possible values are:

- `same-origin`
  - : Limits resource access to requests coming from the same origin. This is recommended for URLs that reply with sensitive user information or private APIs.
- `same-site`
  - : Limits resource access to requests coming from the same site. This is recommended for responses from origins whose functionality is shared across several other same-site origins. Examples include a company CDN that serves static resources, and a single sign-on (SSO) app that handles authentication.
- `cross-origin`
  - : Allows resources to be accessed by cross-origin requests. This is recommended only for responses from widely-used origins, such as public CDNs or widgets. This is the default value if `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy` is not set.

Set the most restrictive value possible for your site.

If, in turn, your site requires access to cross-origin resources, opt into a better default by sending a {{httpheader("Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy")}} header along with the associated requests. This will prevent loading of cross-origin resources that don't also explicitly send a `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin` header.

## Examples

Instruct browsers to disallow cross-origin requests made in `no-cors` mode:

```http
Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin
```

Instruct browsers to allow cross-origin resource access, including access to features with unthrottled timers (such as {{jsxref("SharedArrayBuffer")}} objects or {{domxref("Performance.now()")}}):

```http
Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

This also permits such resources to be embedded.

# Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is handled using [`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin) and related headers. `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` defines the non-same origins that are allowed to make requests to pages on your domain (i.e., via [`XMLHttpRequest`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) or [`fetch()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/fetch)).

## Problem

By default, [same-origin policy](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) blocks cross-origin HTTP requests initiated by scripts. There are several use cases that require cross-origin script access; for example, Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) that provide hosting for JavaScript/CSS libraries and public API endpoints. However, cross-origin access presents a major security risk and must be carefully controlled.

## Solution

Use `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to define the non-same origins that are allowed to make requests to pages on your domain.

If present, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` should specify the minimum possible number of origins and resources for your site to function. For example, if your server provides both a website and an API intended for remote `XMLHttpRequest` access, only the API resources should return the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header.

Failure to set `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` appropriately will allow unauthorized origins to read the contents of any page on your site. This can be especially dangerous if those sites are able to send credentials, potentially exposing your site to [CSRF](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/CSRF) attacks.

If credentialed access is required from specific origins, ensure `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is set only to those origins, rather than reflecting the [`Origin`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Origin) header. If public non-credentialed access is required, set `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to `*` and omit the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header. Otherwise, omit both headers.

## Examples

Allow any site to read the contents of a JavaScript library:

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

> [!NOTE]
> This setting is required for [Subresource integrity](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Practical_implementation_guides/SRI) to work.

Allow `https://random-dashboard.example.org` to read the returned results of an API:

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://random-dashboard.example.org
```

# Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation

The [`Content-Security-Policy`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) HTTP header provides fine-grained control over the code that can be loaded on a site, and what it is allowed to do.

## Problem

The main problem this article focuses on is cross-site scripting ({{Glossary("Cross-site_scripting", "XSS")}}) attacks. These are generally due to a lack of control and awareness of the sources from which site resources are loaded. This problem gets more difficult to manage as sites become larger and more complex and increasingly rely on third-party resources such as JavaScript libraries.

> [!NOTE]
> CSP is one part of a complete strategy for protecting against XSS attacks. There are other factors involved, such as [output encoding](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/XSS#output_encoding) and [sanitization](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/XSS#sanitization), which are also important.

CSP can also help to fix other problems, which are covered in other articles:

- Preventing [clickjacking](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/Clickjacking) by stopping your site being embedded into {{htmlelement("iframe")}} elements. This is done using the CSP [`frame-ancestors`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/frame-ancestors) directive.
- Preventing [manipulator-in-the-middle](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/MITM) (MiTM) attacks by upgrading any HTTP connections to HTTPS. This is helped by the CSP [`upgrade-insecure-requests`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/upgrade-insecure-requests) directive. See [Upgrading insecure requests](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP#upgrading_insecure_requests).

## Solution

Implementing a [strict CSP](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP#strict_csp) is the best way to mitigate XSS vulnerabilities with CSP. This uses [nonce-](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP#nonces) or [hash-](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP#hashes)based fetch directives to ensure that only scripts and/or styles that include the correct nonce or hash will be executed. JavaScript inserted by a hacker will simply not run.

Strict CSPs also:

- Disable the use of unsafe [inline JavaScript](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP#inline_javascript), meaning inline [event handler attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes#event_handler_attributes) such as `onclick`. This prevents improperly-escaped user inputs from being interpreted by the web browser as JavaScript.
- Disable the use of [risky API calls such as `eval()`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP#eval_and_similar_apis), which is another effect of the `script-src` directive.
- Disable all object embeds via `object-src 'none'`.
- Disable uses of the `<base>` element to set a base URI via `base-uri 'none';`.

Strict CSPs are preferred over [location-based](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP#location-based_policies) policies, also called allowlist policies, where you specify which domains scripts can be run from. This is because allowlist policies often end up allowing unsafe domains, which defeats the entire point of having a CSP, and they can get very large and unwieldy, especially if you are trying to permit services that require many third party scripts to function.

### Steps for implementing CSP

Implement a strict CSP, then start to pinpoint resources that are failing to load as a result of the policy, taking steps to work around these issues.

> [!NOTE]
> Before implementing any actual CSP with the `Content-Security-Policy` header, you are advised to first test it out using the [`Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only) HTTP header; see [Report-only CSPs](#report-only_csps) below.

1. Decide whether to use nonces or hashes. You should use nonces if you can dynamically generate content or hashes if you need to serve static content.
2. Implement a strict CSP, as outlined in the [Solution](#solution) section. Make sure that external and internal scripts (included via {{htmlelement("script")}} elements) that you want to run have the correct nonce inserted into the [`nonce`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/script#nonce) attributes by the server. If you are instead using hashes, external scripts should have the correct hash inserted into [`integrity`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/script#integrity) attributes.
3. If an allowed script goes on to load third-party scripts, those scripts will fail to load because they won't have the required nonce or hash. Mitigate this problem by adding the [`strict-dynamic`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP#the_strict-dynamic_keyword) directive, which gives scripts loaded by the first script the same level of trust without being explicitly given a nonce or hash.
4. Refactor patterns disallowed by the strict CSP, such as inline event handlers and `eval()`. For example, replace inline event handlers with [`addEventListener()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) calls inside scripts.
5. Unless sites need the ability to include embeds, their execution should be disabled with `object-src 'none'`.
6. If you are unable to remove usages of `eval()`, you can add the [`unsafe-eval`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy#unsafe-eval) keyword to your strict CSP to allow them, although this makes the CSP significantly weaker.
7. If you are unable to remove event handler attributes, you can add the [`unsafe-hashes`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy#unsafe-hashes) keyword to your strict CSP to allow them. This is somewhat unsafe, but much safer than allowing all inline JavaScript.

If you are unable to get a strict CSP to work, an allowlist-based CSP is much better than none, and a CSP like `default-src https:` still provides some protection, disabling unsafe inline/`eval()` and only allowing loading of resources (images, fonts, scripts, etc.) over HTTPS.

> [!WARNING]
> If at all possible, avoid including unsafe sources inside your CSP. Examples include:
>
> - `unsafe-inline`.
> - `data:` URIs inside `script-src`, `object-src`, or `default-src`.
> - Overly broad sources or form submission targets.

If you are unable to use the `Content-Security-Policy` header, pages can instead include a [`<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="…">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/http-equiv) element. This should be the first {{htmlelement("meta")}} element that appears inside the document {{htmlelement("head")}}.

### Report-only CSPs

Before implementing any actual CSP with the `Content-Security-Policy` header, you are advised to first test it out using the [`Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only) HTTP header. This allows you to see if any violations would have occurred with that policy.

Sites should use the [`report-to`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/report-to) and [`report-uri`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/report-uri) [reporting directives](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Reporting_directive). These cause the browser to [`POST`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/POST) JSON reports about CSP violations to endpoints (specified in the {{httpheader("Reporting-Endpoints")}} header in the case of `report-to`). This allows CSP violations to be caught and repaired quickly.

> [!NOTE]
> The `report-to` directive is preferred over the deprecated `report-uri` directive. However, both are still needed because `report-to` does not yet have full cross-browser support.

# Practical security implementation guides

Users frequently input sensitive data on websites, such as names, addresses, passwords, and banking details. As a web developer, it's crucial to protect this information from bad actors who use a wide range of exploits to steal such information and use it for personal gain. The focus of [web security](/en-US/docs/Web/Security) is to help you protect your website against these exploits and secure your users' sensitive data.

This page lists guides that summarize some best practices for implementing security features on websites. While these guides do not cover all possible security scenarios and cannot guarantee complete security of your website, following the information and best practices in these guides will make your sites significantly more secure.

## HTTP security fundamentals

The guides in this section summarize best practices for implementing HTTP headers correctly to mitigate security issues, and are directly related to the [HTTP Observatory](/en-US/observatory) tool.

Observatory performs security audits on a website and provides a grade and score along with recommendations for fixing the security issues it finds. These guides explain how to resolve issues surfaced by the HTTP Observatory tests: the tool links to the relevant guide for each issue, helping guide you towards an effective resolution. Interestingly, Mozilla's internal developer teams use this guidance when implementing websites to ensure that security best practices are applied.

The guides in the table below are listed in the order that we recommend implementing the security features they describe. This order is based on a combination of each feature's security impact and the ease of its implementation from both operational and developmental perspectives. The table provides information about each feature's impact, difficulty of implementation, whether or not it is required, and a brief description.

# MIME type verification

The [`X-Content-Type-Options`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options) header informs browsers not to load scripts and stylesheets unless the server indicates the correct [MIME type](/en-US/docs/Glossary/MIME_type).

## Problem

Without proper MIME type verification, browsers might incorrectly detect non-script and non-stylesheet files as scripts or stylesheets. This error allows potentially malicious files to be loaded via {{htmlelement("script")}} and {{htmlelement("link")}} elements as part of Cross-site scripting ({{Glossary("Cross-site_scripting", "XSS")}}) attacks.

## Solution

All sites must set the `X-Content-Type-Options` header with a value of `nosniff`, and set appropriate MIME types for the files they serve (i.e., via the [`Content-Type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Type) header).

`nosniff` blocks a request if the request destination:

- is of type `style` and the MIME type is not `text/css`.
- is of type `script` and the MIME type is not a valid [JavaScript MIME type](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/MIME_types#textjavascript).

## Examples

Prevent browsers from incorrectly detecting non-stylesheets as stylesheets and non-scripts as scripts:

```http
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
```

# Referrer policy configuration

The [`Referrer-Policy`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Referrer-Policy) header provides fine-grained control over how and when browsers transmit the [`Referer`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Referer) header.

## Problem

When a user navigates to a site via a hyperlink, or when a website loads an external resource, browsers inform the destination site of the origin of the requests via the HTTP `Referer` (sic) header. Although this can be useful for a variety of purposes, it can also pose a risk to the [privacy](/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy) of users.

For example, if a page at `https://example.com/page.html` contains the following HTML:

```html
<img src="https://not.example.com/image.jpg" />
```

The browser will send a request like this:

```http
GET /image.jpg HTTP/1.1
Host: not.example.com
Referer: https://example.com/page.html
```

`not.example.com` now knows where the request came from. Even this small amount of information poses a privacy risk.

Other cases could result in the browser transmitting internal-use-only URLs, which it may not have intended to reveal, or URL parameters containing sensitive information.

## Solution

Use [`Referrer-Policy`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Referrer-Policy) to limit the information available in the `Referer` header or to stop the `Referer` header from being sent altogether.

The most useful directives available for `Referrer-Policy` are listed below, in decreasing order of strictness. Choose the strictest one that still allows your site to function properly:

- `no-referrer`: Never send the `Referer` header.
- `same-origin`: Send the `Referrer` header, but only on same-origin requests.
- `strict-origin`: Send the `Referrer` header to all origins, but only include the URL without the path (e.g., `https://example.com/`).
- `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`: Send the full `Referrer` header on same-origin requests and only the URL without the path on cross-origin requests. This is the default value.

While there are other `Referrer-Policy` directives, they do not protect user privacy or limit exposure as effectively as the options listed above. In recent versions of Firefox and Safari, "unsafe" directives (`no-referrer-when-downgrade`, `origin-when-cross-origin`, and `unsafe-url`) behave like `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`.

If you are unable to use the `Referrer-Policy` header, you can alternatively set page-wide policies using a [`<meta http-equiv="Referrer-Policy" content="…">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/http-equiv) element. This should be the first {{htmlelement("meta")}} element that appears in the document {{htmlelement("head")}}. You can also set policies on individual elements using the [`referrerpolicy`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/a#referrerpolicy) HTML attribute and on individual [fetch](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/fetch) requests using the {{domxref("Request.referrerPolicy")}} property.

## Examples

On `example.com`, send the `Referer` header only when loading or linking to other `example.com` resources:

```http
Referrer-Policy: same-origin
```

Send the shortened referrer on cross-origin requests and the full referrer on same-origin requests:

```http
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

Disable referrers for browsers that don't support `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`; use `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` for browsers that do:

```http
Referrer-Policy: no-referrer, strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

Do the same, but with a `<meta>` element:

```html
<meta
  http-equiv="Referrer-Policy"
  content="no-referrer, strict-origin-when-cross-origin" />
```

The `referrerpolicy` attribute doesn't support multiple values, so only set `no-referrer`:

```html
<a href="https://example.org/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> My link </a>
```

# robots.txt configuration

[`robots.txt`](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Robots.txt) is a text file that tells robots (such as search engine indexers) how to behave, by instructing them not to crawl certain paths on the website. It is placed within the root directory of a website.

## Problem

Many factors can increase the load on your website; this includes web crawlers. In addition, if allowed to crawl the entirety of a site, web crawlers can cause pollution of search results with resources that don't benefit from being searchable.

## Solution

Use `robots.txt` to reduce website load and stop unsuitable content appearing in search results. Using this file is optional and should only be used for these purposes. It should not be used as a way to prevent the disclosure of private information or to hide portions of a website.

While using this file can prevent pages from appearing in search engine results, it does not secure websites against attackers. On the contrary, it can unintentionally help them: `robots.txt` is publicly accessible, and by adding your sensitive page paths to it, you are showing their locations to potential attackers.

Also be aware that some robots, such as malware robots and email address harvesters, will ignore your `robots.txt` file.

## Examples

Stop all search engines from crawling a site:

```http
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
```

Hide certain directories (this is not recommended):

```http example-bad
User-agent: *
Disallow: /secret/admin-interface
```

# Subresource integrity (SRI) implementation

[Subresource Integrity](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) (SRI) enables browsers to verify that resources they fetch (for example, from a CDN) are delivered without unexpected manipulation. It works by allowing you to provide a cryptographic hash that the fetched resource must match.

## Problem

If an attacker exploited a content delivery network (CDN) and modified the contents of JavaScript libraries hosted on that CDN, it would create vulnerabilities in all websites that use those libraries.

For example, JavaScript hosted on `library.org` that is loaded from `example.org` can access the entire contents of `example.org`. If an attacker modifies that hosted JavaScript to include malicious code, it could alter download links, deface the site, steal credentials, cause denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and so on.

## Solution

Use SRI to lock an external JavaScript resource to its known contents at a specific point in time. This is verified by a base64-encoded cryptographic hash. Specify this hash in the `integrity` attribute when you load the resource.

If the file is modified after this point, the hash won't match, and supporting web browsers will refuse to load it.

SRI should be used when loading external JavaScript or stylesheet resources. The resources should be loaded over HTTPS.

Note that CDNs must use [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Practical_implementation_guides/CORS) by setting the [`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin) header.

## Examples

Load jQuery 2.1.4 from its CDN:

```html
<script
  src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-R4/ztc4ZlRqWjqIuvf6RX5yb/v90qNGx6fS48N0tRxiGkqveZETq72KgDVJCp2TC"
  crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

Load AngularJS 1.4.8 from its CDN:

```html
<script
  src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.4.8/angular.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-r1y8TJcloKTvouxnYsi4PJAx+nHNr90ibsEn3zznzDzWBN9X3o3kbHLSgcIPtzAp"
  crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

Generate a hash yourself:

```bash
$ curl -s https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.4.8/angular.min.js | \
    openssl dgst -sha384 -binary | \
    openssl base64 -A

# Transport Layer Security (TLS) configuration

[Transport Layer Security (TLS)](/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS) provides assurances about the confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of all communications, and as such, should be used for all inbound and outbound website communications.

## TLS configuration

### Problem

If data is sent over the web unencrypted, it can be intercepted by third parties, who can access and modify the data — this is often known as a [manipulator-in-the-middle](/en-US/docs/Glossary/MitM) (MiTM) attack. MiTM attacks have severe consequences for the security of your system.

All requests and responses should therefore be sent over HTTPS, which uses TLS to encrypt the data. The modern web practically enforces this — all browsers are moving towards requiring [HTTPS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTPS) by default, and many web features can only be used in a [secure context](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts).

### Solution

You should set up your server software to use a secure configuration that enforces the use of HTTPS with safe TLS settings. There are several TLS configuration generators available that can help with this, for example, the Mozilla [SSL Configuration Generator](https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/). This tool provides several options based on Mozilla's [TLS guidelines](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS).

## Resource loading

### Problem

All resources, regardless of their origin, should be loaded over secure channels.

Secure (HTTPS) websites that attempt to load active resources such as JavaScript over insecure connections (HTTP) will be blocked by browsers. As a result, users will experience degraded UIs and [mixed content](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content) warnings. In the code below, for example, HTTP is being used incorrectly to load a JavaScript library:

```html example-bad
<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.0.min.js"></script>
```

Similarly, attempts to load passive content such as images insecurely, although less risky, will still lead to degraded UIs and mixed content warnings, and can allow active attackers to deface websites or phish users. For example:

```html example-bad
<img src="http://very.badssl.com/image.jpg" />
```

Although modern browsers make it evident when websites are loading resources insecurely, these errors still occur across the web with significant frequency.

### Solution

Verify that all resources are loaded over HTTPS prior to deployment.

### Examples

In this example, HTTPS is being used correctly to load a JavaScript library:

```html example-good
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.0.min.js"></script>
```

## HTTP redirection

### Problem

Websites may continue to listen on port 80 (HTTP) to prevent connection errors when users type a URL into their address bar, as initial browser connections are often made via HTTP. This poses an initial security risk during the first connection to sites as that connection is not protected by TLS.

In addition, sites should avoid redirections from HTTP on one host to HTTPS on a different host, as this prevents `Strict-Transport-Security` from being set for the first host (see [HTTP Strict Transport Security](#http_strict_transport_security_implementation)).

### Solution

Sites that listen on port 80 should only redirect to the same resource on HTTPS. Once the redirection has occurred, `Strict-Transport-Security` should ensure that all future attempts to access the site via HTTP are automatically redirected to the secure site.

APIs or websites not intended for public access should entirely disable the use of HTTP.

To fix the "different hosts" problem:

1. First, redirect from http\://example.com/ to https\://example.com/.
2. Next, redirect from https\://example.com/ to https\://example.org/.

### Examples

Redirect all incoming HTTP requests to the same site and URI on HTTPS, using NGINX:

```nginx
server {
  listen 80;

  return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

Redirect `site.example.org` from HTTP to HTTPS, using Apache:

```apacheconf
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName site.example.org
  Redirect permanent / https://site.example.org/
</VirtualHost>
```

## HTTP Strict Transport Security implementation

### Problem

To prevent [manipulator-in-the-middle](/en-US/docs/Glossary/MitM) (MiTM) attacks, browsers should only connect to sites via HTTPS.

### Solution

HTTP [`Strict-Transport-Security`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) (HSTS) is an HTTP header that notifies browsers to connect to a given site only over HTTPS, even if the originally specified scheme was HTTP. Browsers with HSTS set for a given site will automatically upgrade all requests to HTTPS for that site. HSTS also tells browsers to treat TLS and certificate-related errors more strictly by disabling the ability to bypass the certificate error page.

`Strict-Transport-Security` supports the following directives:

- `max-age`
  - : Sets the duration, in seconds, for which browsers will redirect to HTTPS.
- `includeSubDomains` {{optional_inline}}
  - : Specifies whether browsers should upgrade requests on all subdomains to HTTPS. For example, setting `includeSubDomains` on `domain.example.com` will ensure that requests to `host1.domain.example.com` and `host2.domain.example.com` are upgraded in addition to `domain.example.com`.
- `preload` {{optional_inline}}
  - : Specifies whether the site should be preloaded. Including this directive means your site can be included in the [HSTS preload list](https://hstspreload.org/).

Follow these steps to correctly implement HSTS on your website:

1. Set a `max-age` value of at least six months (`15768000`). Longer periods, such as two years (`63072000`), are recommended. Once this value is set, the site must continue to support HTTPS until the expiry time is reached.
2. If possible, set `includeSubDomains` to improve security on all subdomains. Careful testing is needed when setting this directive because it could disable sites on subdomains that don't yet have HTTPS enabled.
3. If possible, set `preload` to make it possible to include your website in the HSTS preload list. To add it to the list, visit https://hstspreload.org/ and enter your site URL into the form at the top of the page, fixing any issues that it mentions. Web browsers will perform HTTPS upgrades to preloaded sites before receiving the initial `Strict-Transport-Security` header. This prevents [downgrade attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downgrade_attack) upon first use and is recommended for all high-risk websites. Note that being included in the HSTS preload list also requires `includeSubDomains` to be set and `max-age` to be set to a minimum of 1 year (`31536000`).

Along with `Strict-Transport-Security`, you should also set the [`upgrade-insecure-requests`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/upgrade-insecure-requests) directive in your {{httpheader("Content-Security-Policy")}}. This instructs browsers to treat all of a site's insecure URLs (those served over HTTP) as though they have been served over HTTPS. `upgrade-insecure-requests` is intended for websites with large numbers of insecure legacy URLs that need to be rewritten.

### Examples

It is recommended to connect to a site via HTTPS for two years:

```http
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000
```

If possible, additionally upgrade subdomain requests to HTTPS and include the site in the preload list:

```http
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload
```

Also set the `upgrade-insecure-requests` CSP:

```http
Content-Security-Policy: upgrade-insecure-requests;
```

# How to turn off form autocompletion

This article explains how to disable autocomplete for form fields on a website.

## Understanding autocompletion and autofill

By default, browsers remember information that the user submits through {{HTMLElement("input")}} fields on websites. This enables browsers to offer autocompletion (that is, suggest possible completions for fields that the user has started typing in) or autofill (that is, pre-populate certain fields upon load).

These features are usually enabled by default, but they can be a privacy concern for users, so browsers can let users disable them. However, some data submitted in forms is either not useful beyond the current interaction (for example, a one-time pin) or contains sensitive information (for example, a unique government identifier or credit card security code). As the website author, you may prefer the browser not to remember the values for such fields, even if the browser's autocomplete feature is enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> [WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.3.5: Identify Input Purpose](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html) does not require that autocomplete or autofill features must work; it only requires that form fields that relate to specific personal user information are programmatically identified. This means that the criterion can still be met (by adding the relevant [`autocomplete`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/autocomplete) attributes to individual form fields) even when autocompletion for the form itself has been turned off.

## Disabling autocompletion

To disable autocompletion in forms, you can set the [`autocomplete`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/autocomplete) attribute to `"off"`:

```plain
autocomplete="off"
```

You can do this either for an entire form, or for specific input elements in a form:

```html-nolint
<form method="post" action="/form" autocomplete="off">
  …
</form>
```

```html
<form method="post" action="/form">
  …
  <div>
    <label for="cc">Credit card:</label>
    <input type="text" id="cc" name="cc" autocomplete="off" />
  </div>
</form>
```

Setting `autocomplete="off"` on fields has two effects:

- It tells the browser not to save data inputted by the user for later autocompletion on similar forms (some browsers make exceptions for special cases, such as prompting users to save passwords).
- It stops the browser from caching form data in the session history. When form data is cached in session history, the information filled in by the user is shown in the case where the user has submitted the form and clicked the Back button to go back to the original form page.

If a browser keeps on making suggestions even after setting autocomplete to off, then you have to change the `name` attribute of the `<input>` element.

## Managing autofill for login fields

Modern browsers implement integrated password management: when the user enters a username and password for a site, the browser offers to remember it for the user. When the user visits the site again, the browser autofills the login fields with the stored values.

Additionally, the browser enables the user to choose a master password that the browser will use to encrypt stored login details.

Even without a master password, in-browser password management is generally seen as a net gain for security. Since users do not have to remember passwords that the browser stores for them, they are able to choose stronger passwords than they would otherwise.

For this reason, many modern browsers do not support `autocomplete="off"` for login fields:

- If a site sets `autocomplete="off"` on a {{HTMLElement("form")}} element and the form includes username and password input fields, the browser will still offer to remember this login. If the user agrees, the browser will autofill those fields the next time the user visits the page.
- If a site sets `autocomplete="off"` for username and password {{HTMLElement("input")}} fields, the browser will still offer to remember this login. If the user agrees, the browser will autofill those fields the next time the user visits the page.

If you are defining a user management page where a user can specify a new password for another person, and therefore, you want to prevent autofilling of password fields, you can use `autocomplete="new-password"`.

This attribute is a hint to browsers; some may not comply with it.
# Referer header: Privacy and security concerns

There are privacy and security risks associated with the [Referer HTTP header](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Referer). This article describes them, and offers advice on mitigating those risks.

## The referrer problem

The {{httpheader("Referer")}} (sic) header contains the address of a request (for example, the address of the previous web page from which a link to the currently requested page was followed, or the address of a page loading an image or other resource). This has many fairly innocent uses, including analytics, logging, or optimized caching. However, there are more problematic uses such as tracking or stealing information, or even just side effects such as inadvertently leaking sensitive information.

For example, consider a "reset password" page with a social media link in a footer. If the link was followed, depending on how information was shared the social media site may receive the reset password URL and may still be able to use the shared information, potentially compromising a user's security.

By the same logic, an image from a third party site embedded in your page could result in sensitive information being leaked to the third party. Even if security is not compromised, the information may not be something the user wants shared.

## How can we fix this?

Much of this risk can be mitigated by sensible design of applications. A sensible application would remove such risks by making single-use password reset URLs, or combining them with a unique user token. The risk can also be reduced by transmitting sensitive data in more secure ways.

You should use {{HTTPMethod("POST")}} rather than {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} wherever possible, to avoid passing sensitive data to other locations via URLs.

You should always use {{glossary("HTTPS")}} for your sites. This has many security advantages, including the fact that HTTPS sites will never transmit referrer information to non-HTTPS sites. This advice is less relevant now that most of the web is using HTTPS, but it is still a worthy consideration.

In addition, you should consider removing any third party content (e.g., social networking widgets embedded in {{htmlelement("iframe")}}) from secure areas of your website, like password reset pages, payment forms, login areas, etc.

You can also mitigate such risks using:

- The {{httpheader("Referrer-Policy")}} header on your server to control what information is sent through the {{httpheader("Referer")}} header. For example, a directive of `no-referrer` would omit the Referer header entirely.
- The `referrerpolicy` attribute on HTML elements that are in danger of leaking such information (such as {{HTMLElement("img")}} and {{HTMLElement("a")}}). This can for example be set to `no-referrer` to stop the `Referer` header being sent altogether.
- The [`rel`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel) attribute set to [`noreferrer`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel/noreferrer) on HTML elements that are in danger of leaking such information (such as {{HTMLElement("form")}} and {{HTMLElement("a")}}).
- A {{HTMLElement("meta")}} element with a [name](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/name) of `referrer` and the content set to `no-referrer` to disable the Referer header for the whole document. See [Referrer-Policy Integration with HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Referrer-Policy#integration_with_html).
- The [Exit page](https://geekthis.net/post/hide-http-referer-headers/#exit-page-redirect) technique.

Security-conscious server-side frameworks tend to have built in mitigations for such problems, for example:

- [Security in Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/security/) (especially see [Cross site request forgery (CSRF) protection](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/security/#cross-site-request-forgery-csrf-protection)).
- [Helmet referrer-policy](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet/tree/main/middlewares/referrer-policy) — middleware for setting Referrer-Policy in Node.js/Express apps (see also [Helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs) for more security provisions).

## Policy and requirements

It would make sense to write a set of security and privacy requirements for your project team(s) that specify usage of such features to mitigate the associated risks. You should enlist the help of a web security expert to write these requirements, and consider both user needs and welfare, as well as other issues like policy and regulation enforced by legislation such as the [EU General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr.eu/) (GDPR).

# Same-origin policy

The **same-origin policy** is a critical security mechanism that restricts how a document or script loaded by one {{Glossary("origin")}} can interact with a resource from another origin.

It helps isolate potentially malicious documents, reducing possible attack vectors. For example, it prevents a malicious website on the Internet from running JS in a browser to read data from a third-party webmail service (which the user is signed into) or a company intranet (which is protected from direct access by the attacker by not having a public IP address) and relaying that data to the attacker.

## Definition of an origin

Two URLs have the _same origin_ if the {{Glossary("protocol")}}, {{Glossary("port")}} (if specified), and {{Glossary("host")}} are the same for both. You may see this referenced as the "scheme/host/port tuple", or just "tuple". (A "tuple" is a set of items that together comprise a whole — a generic form for double/triple/quadruple/quintuple/etc.)

The following table gives examples of origin comparisons with the URL `http://store.company.com/dir/page.html`:

| URL                                               | Outcome     | Reason                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `http://store.company.com/dir2/other.html`        | Same origin | Only the path differs                            |
| `http://store.company.com/dir/inner/another.html` | Same origin | Only the path differs                            |
| `https://store.company.com/page.html`             | Failure     | Different protocol                               |
| `http://store.company.com:81/dir/page.html`       | Failure     | Different port (`http://` is port 80 by default) |
| `http://news.company.com/dir/page.html`           | Failure     | Different host                                   |

### Inherited origins

Scripts executed from pages with an `about:blank` or [`javascript:` URL](/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Schemes/javascript) inherit the origin of the document containing that URL, since these types of URLs do not contain information about an origin server.

For example, `about:blank` is often used as a URL of new, empty popup windows into which the parent script writes content (e.g., via the {{domxref("Window.open()")}} mechanism). If this popup also contains JavaScript, that script would inherit the same origin as the script that created it.

`data:` URLs get a new, empty, security context.

### File origins

Modern browsers usually treat the origin of files loaded using the `file:///` scheme as _opaque origins_.
What this means is that if a file includes other files from the same folder (say), they are not assumed to come from the same origin, and may trigger {{Glossary("CORS")}} errors.

Note that the [URL specification](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#origin) states that the origin of files is implementation-dependent, and some browsers may treat files in the same directory or subdirectory as same-origin even though this has [security implications](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2019-21/#CVE-2019-11730).

## Changing origin

> [!WARNING]
> The approach described here (using the {{domxref("document.domain")}} setter) is deprecated because it undermines the security protections provided by the same origin policy, and complicates the origin model in browsers, leading to interoperability problems and security bugs.

A page may change its own origin, with some limitations. A script can set the value of {{domxref("document.domain")}} to its current domain or a superdomain of its current domain. If set to a superdomain of the current domain, the shorter superdomain is used for same-origin checks.

For example, assume a script from the document at `http://store.company.com/dir/other.html` executes the following:

```js
document.domain = "company.com";
```

Afterward, the page can pass the same-origin check with `http://company.com/dir/page.html` (assuming `http://company.com/dir/page.html` sets its `document.domain` to `"company.com"` to indicate that it wishes to allow that - see {{domxref("document.domain")}} for more). However, `company.com` could **not** set `document.domain` to `othercompany.com`, since that is not a superdomain of `company.com`.

The port number is checked separately by the browser. Any call to `document.domain`, including `document.domain = document.domain`, causes the port number to be overwritten with `null`. Therefore, one **cannot** make `company.com:8080` talk to `company.com` by only setting `document.domain = "company.com"` in the first. It has to be set in both so their port numbers are both `null`.

The mechanism has some limitations. For example, it will throw a `SecurityError` [`DOMException`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMException) if the document is in a sandboxed [`<iframe>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/iframe), and changing the origin in this way does not affect the origin checks used by many Web APIs (e.g., [`localStorage`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage), [`indexedDB`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API), [`BroadcastChannel`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/BroadcastChannel), [`SharedWorker`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/SharedWorker)). A more exhaustive list of failure cases can be found in [Document.domain > Failures](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/domain#failures).

> [!NOTE]
> When using `document.domain` to allow a subdomain to access its parent, you need to set `document.domain` to the _same value_ in both the parent domain and the subdomain. This is necessary even if doing so is setting the parent domain back to its original value. Failure to do this may result in permission errors.

## Cross-origin network access

The same-origin policy controls interactions between two different origins, such as when you use {{domxref("Window/fetch", "fetch()")}} or an {{htmlelement("img")}} element. These interactions are typically placed into three categories:

- Cross-origin _writes_ are typically allowed. Examples are links, redirects, and form submissions. Some HTTP requests require [preflight](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS#preflighted_requests).
- Cross-origin _embedding_ is typically allowed. (Examples are listed below.)
- Cross-origin _reads_ are typically disallowed, but read access is often leaked by embedding. For example, you can read the dimensions of an embedded image, the actions of an embedded script, or the [availability of an embedded resource](https://bugzil.la/629094).

Here are some examples of resources which may be embedded cross-origin:

- JavaScript with `<script src="…"></script>`. Error details for syntax errors are only available for same-origin scripts.
- CSS applied with `<link rel="stylesheet" href="…">`. Due to the relaxed syntax rules of CSS, cross-origin CSS requires a correct `Content-Type` header. Browsers block stylesheet loads if it is a cross-origin load where the MIME type is incorrect and the resource does not start with a valid CSS construct.
- Images displayed by {{htmlelement("img")}}.
- Media played by {{htmlelement("video")}} and {{htmlelement("audio")}}.
- External resources embedded with {{htmlelement("object")}} and {{htmlelement("embed")}}.
- Fonts applied with {{cssxref("@font-face")}}. Some browsers allow cross-origin fonts, others require same-origin.
- Anything embedded by {{htmlelement("iframe")}}. Sites can use the {{HTTPHeader("X-Frame-Options")}} header to prevent cross-origin framing.

### How to allow cross-origin access

Use [CORS](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS) to allow cross-origin access. CORS is a part of {{Glossary("HTTP")}} that lets servers specify any other hosts from which a browser should permit loading of content.

### How to block cross-origin access

- To prevent cross-origin writes, check an unguessable token in the request — known as a [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf) token. You must prevent cross-origin reads of pages that require this token.
- To prevent cross-origin reads of a resource, ensure that it is not embeddable. It is often necessary to prevent embedding because embedding a resource always leaks some information about it.
- To prevent cross-origin embeds, ensure that your resource cannot be interpreted as one of the embeddable formats listed above. Browsers may not respect the `Content-Type` header. For example, if you point a `<script>` tag at an HTML document, the browser will try to parse the HTML as JavaScript. When your resource is not an entry point to your site, you can also use a CSRF token to prevent embedding.

## Cross-origin script API access

JavaScript APIs like {{domxref("HTMLIFrameElement.contentWindow", "iframe.contentWindow")}}, {{domxref("window.parent")}}, {{domxref("window.open")}}, and {{domxref("window.opener")}} allow documents to directly reference each other. When two documents do not have the same origin, these references provide very limited access to {{domxref("Window")}} and {{domxref("Location")}} objects, as described in the next two sections.

To communicate between documents from different origins, use {{domxref("window.postMessage")}}.

Specification: [HTML Living Standard § Cross-origin objects](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#cross-origin-objects).

### Window

The following cross-origin access to these `Window` properties is allowed:

| Methods                           |
| --------------------------------- |
| {{domxref("window.blur")}}        |
| {{domxref("window.close")}}       |
| {{domxref("window.focus")}}       |
| {{domxref("window.postMessage")}} |

| Attributes                     |             |
| ------------------------------ | ----------- |
| {{domxref("window.closed")}}   | Read only.  |
| {{domxref("window.frames")}}   | Read only.  |
| {{domxref("window.length")}}   | Read only.  |
| {{domxref("window.location")}} | Read/Write. |
| {{domxref("window.opener")}}   | Read only.  |
| {{domxref("window.parent")}}   | Read only.  |
| {{domxref("window.self")}}     | Read only.  |
| {{domxref("window.top")}}      | Read only.  |
| {{domxref("window.window")}}   | Read only.  |

Some browsers allow access to more properties than the above.

### Location

The following cross-origin access to `Location` properties is allowed:

| Methods                         |
| ------------------------------- |
| {{domxref("location.replace")}} |

| Attributes                   |             |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| {{domxref("location.href")}} | Write-only. |

Some browsers allow access to more properties than the above.

## Cross-origin data storage access

Access to data stored in the browser such as [Web Storage](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API) and [IndexedDB](/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) are separated by origin. Each origin gets its own separate storage, and JavaScript in one origin cannot read from or write to the storage belonging to another origin.

{{glossary("Cookie", "Cookies")}} use a separate definition of origins. A page can set a cookie for its own domain or any parent domain, as long as the parent domain is not a public suffix. Firefox and Chrome use the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/) to determine if a domain is a public suffix. When you set a cookie, you can limit its availability using the `Domain`, `Path`, `Secure`, and `HttpOnly` flags. When you read a cookie, you cannot see from where it was set. Even if you use only secure https connections, any cookie you see may have been set using an insecure connection.

# Secure contexts

A **secure context** is a `Window` or `Worker` for which certain minimum standards of authentication and confidentiality are met. Many Web APIs and features are accessible only in a secure context. The primary goal of secure contexts is to prevent [MITM attackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) from accessing powerful APIs that could further compromise the victim of an attack.

## Why should some features be restricted?

Some APIs on the web are very powerful, giving an attacker the ability to do the following and more:

- Invade a user's privacy.
- Get low-level access to a user's computer.
- Get access to data such as user credentials.

## When is a context considered secure?

A context is considered secure when it meets certain minimum standards of authentication and confidentiality defined in the [Secure Contexts](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-secure-contexts/) specification. A particular document is considered to be in a secure context when it is the [active document](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#active-document) of a [top-level browsing context](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#top-level-browsing-context) (basically, a containing window or tab) that is a secure context.

For example, even for a document delivered over TLS within an {{HTMLElement("iframe")}}, its context is **not** considered secure if it has an ancestor that was not also delivered over TLS.

However, it's important to note that if a non-secure context causes a new window to be created (with or without specifying [noopener](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open)), then the fact that the opener was insecure has no effect on whether the new window is considered secure. That's because the determination of whether a particular document is in a secure context is based only on considering it within the top-level browsing context with which it is associated — and not whether a non-secure context happened to be used to create it.

Resources that are not local, to be considered secure, must meet the following criteria:

- They must be served over `https://` URLs.
- The security properties of the network channel used to deliver the resource must not be considered deprecated.

## Potentially trustworthy origins

A **potentially trustworthy origin** is one that the browser can generally trust to deliver data security, even though strictly speaking it does not meet the criteria of a secure context.

Locally-delivered resources such as those with `http://127.0.0.1`, `http://localhost`, and `http://*.localhost` URLs (for example, `http://dev.whatever.localhost/`) are not delivered using HTTPS, but they can be considered to have been delivered securely because they are on the same device as the browser. They are therefore potentially trustworthy. This is convenient for developers testing applications locally.

The same is generally true for `file://` URLs.

Secure [WebSocket](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) (`"wss://"`) URLs are also considered potentially trustworthy.

Vendor-specific URL schemes like `app://` or `chrome-extension://` are not considered potentially trustworthy by all browsers, but they may well be by the browsers whose vendors they originate from.

> [!NOTE]
> Firefox 84 and later support `http://localhost` and `http://*.localhost` URLs as trustworthy origins (earlier versions did not, because `localhost` was not guaranteed to map to a local/loopback address).

## Feature detection

Pages can use feature detection to check whether they are in a secure context or not by using the {{domxref("Window.isSecureContext")}} or {{domxref("WorkerGlobalScope.isSecureContext")}} boolean, which is exposed on the global scope.

```js
if (window.isSecureContext) {
  // Page is a secure context so service workers are now available
  navigator.serviceWorker.register("/offline-worker.js").then(() => {
    // …
  });
}
```

# Subresource Integrity

**Subresource Integrity** (SRI) is a security feature that enables browsers to verify that resources they fetch (for example, from a [CDN](/en-US/docs/Glossary/CDN)) are delivered without unexpected manipulation. It works by allowing you to provide a cryptographic hash that a fetched resource must match.

> [!NOTE]
> For subresource-integrity verification of a resource served from an origin other than the document in which it's embedded, browsers additionally check the resource using [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS), to ensure the origin serving the resource allows it to be shared with the requesting origin.

## How Subresource Integrity helps

Websites sometimes choose to rely on a third party such as a {{glossary("CDN", "Content Delivery Network (CDN)")}} to host some of their resources, rather than self-host all their resources. For example, a document served from `https://example.com` might include a resource from another location:

```html
<script src="https://not-example.com/script.js"></script>
```

This comes with a risk, in that if an attacker gains control of the third-party host, the attacker can inject arbitrary malicious content into its files (or replace the files completely) and thus can also potentially attack sites that fetch files from it.

Subresource Integrity enables you to mitigate some risks of attacks such as this, by ensuring that the files your web application or web document fetches have been delivered without an attacker having injected any additional content into those files — and without any other changes of any kind at all having been made to those files.

## Using Subresource Integrity

You use the Subresource Integrity feature by specifying a base64-encoded cryptographic hash of a resource (file) you're telling the browser to fetch, in the value of the `integrity` attribute of a {{HTMLElement("script")}} element or a {{HTMLElement("link")}} element with [`rel="stylesheet"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel#stylesheet), [`rel="preload"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel/preload), or [`rel="modulepreload"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel/modulepreload).

An `integrity` value begins with at least one string, with each string including a prefix indicating a particular hash algorithm (currently the allowed prefixes are `sha256`, `sha384`, and `sha512`), followed by a dash, and ending with the actual base64-encoded hash.

> [!NOTE]
> An **integrity** value may contain multiple hashes separated by whitespace. A resource will be loaded if it matches one of those hashes.

Example `integrity` string with base64-encoded sha384 hash:

```plain
sha384-oqVuAfXRKap7fdgcCY5uykM6+R9GqQ8K/uxy9rx7HNQlGYl1kPzQho1wx4JwY8wC
```

So `oqVuAfXRKap7fdgcCY5uykM6+R9GqQ8K/uxy9rx7HNQlGYl1kPzQho1wx4JwY8wC` is the "hash" part, and the prefix `sha384` indicates that it's a sha384 hash.

> [!NOTE]
> An `integrity` value's "hash" part is, strictly speaking, a **_cryptographic_ _digest_** formed by applying a particular hash function to some input (for example, a script or stylesheet file). But it's common to use the shorthand "hash" to mean _cryptographic_ _digest_, so that's what's used in this article.

### Tools for generating SRI hashes

#### SRI Hash Generator

The [SRI Hash Generator](https://www.srihash.org/) is an online tool you can use to generate SRI hashes.

#### Using OpenSSL

You can generate SRI hashes from the command-line using **OpenSSL** with a command invocation such as:

```bash
cat FILENAME.js | openssl dgst -sha384 -binary | openssl base64 -A
```

In a Windows environment, you can create a tool for generating SRI hashes with the following code:

```batch
@echo off
set bits=384
openssl dgst -sha%bits% -binary %1% | openssl base64 -A > tmp
set /p a= < tmp
del tmp
echo sha%bits%-%a%
pause
```

To use that code:

1. Save that code in a file named `sri-hash.bat` in the Windows SendTo folder in your environment (for example, `C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo`).
2. Right-click a file in the File Explorer, select **Send to…**, and then select `sri-hash`. You will see the integrity value in a command box.
3. Select the integrity value and right-click to copy it to the Clipboard.
4. Press any key to dismiss the command box.

> [!NOTE]
> If OpenSSL is not installed on your system, visit the [OpenSSL project website](https://www.openssl.org/) for information about downloading and installing it. The OpenSSL project does not itself host binary distributions of OpenSSL, but does maintain an informal list of third-party distributions: https://github.com/openssl/openssl/wiki/Binaries.

#### Using shasum

You can generate SRI hashes using [**shasum**](https://linux.die.net/man/1/shasum) with a command invocation such as:

```bash
shasum -b -a 384 FILENAME.js | awk '{ print $1 }' | xxd -r -p | base64
```

- The pipe-through `xxd` step takes the hexadecimal output from `shasum` and converts it to binary.
- The pipe-through `awk` step is necessary because `shasum` will pass the hashed filename in its output to `xxd`. That can have disastrous consequences if the filename happens to have valid hex characters in it — because `xxd` will also decode that and pass it to `base64`.

### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing and Subresource Integrity

For subresource-integrity verification of a resource served from an origin other than the document in which it's embedded, browsers additionally check the resource using [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS), to ensure the origin serving the resource allows it to be shared with the requesting origin. Therefore, the resource must be served with an [`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin) header that allows the resource to be shared with the requesting origin; for example:

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

## How browsers handle Subresource Integrity

Browsers handle SRI by doing the following:

1. When a browser encounters a {{HTMLElement("script")}} or {{HTMLElement("link")}} element with an `integrity` attribute, before executing the script or before applying any stylesheet specified by the {{HTMLElement("link")}} element, the browser must first compare the script or stylesheet to the expected hash given in the `integrity` value.

   For subresource-integrity verification of a resource served from an origin other than the document in which it's embedded, browsers additionally check the resource using [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS), to ensure the origin serving the resource allows it to be shared with the requesting origin.

2. If the script or stylesheet doesn't match its associated `integrity` value, the browser must refuse to execute the script or apply the stylesheet, and must instead return a network error indicating that fetching of that script or stylesheet failed.

## Integrity policy

The {{httpheader("Integrity-Policy")}} and {{httpheader("Integrity-Policy-Report-Only")}} HTTP headers enable a document to enforce a policy regarding the integrity metadata requirements on loaded script and stylesheet subresources.

When an `Integrity-Policy` header is specified, the browser blocks requests with [no-cors](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/mode#no-cors) mode or without an `integrity` attribute from being made, and will also report violations if a valid reporting endpoint is specified.
When an `Integrity-Policy-Report-Only` header is specified, the browser allows requests that violate the policy, but will report violations to the reporting endpoint (if a valid reporting endpoint is specified).

Developers would typically use `Integrity-Policy-Report-Only` as a first deployment step in their Integrity Policy journey, to ensure that all the scripts and stylesheets loaded in their documents have appropriate integrity metadata. Once they'd see that no violation reports are being received, they'd know that they can enable blocking using the `Integrity-Policy` header without risking user-facing breakage.

The header values are defined as structured field dictionaries with the following keys:

- `blocked-destinations`
  - : Defines a list of [request destinations](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/destination) to be blocked. The only allowed values are `script` and `style`.
- `sources` {{optional_inline}}
  - : Defines a list of integrity sources. The default and only currently supported value is `inline`. As a result, adding `sources=(inline)` to the header has a similar effect as omitting `sources`.
- `endpoints` {{optional_inline}}
  - : Defines a list of [reporting endpoints](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Reporting-Endpoints#endpoint). The reporting endpoints need to be defined in a {{httpheader("Reporting-Endpoints")}} header.

In cases where a request is blocked by an integrity policy, a [Reporting API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Reporting_API) violation report is created with a type of `integrity-violation` and a body of type {{domxref("IntegrityViolationReportBody")}} that includes information such as the URL of the document and the blocked resource.

A typical report might look like this

```json
{
  "type": "integrity-violation",
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "body": {
    "documentURL": "https://example.com",
    "blockedURL": "https://example.com/main.js",
    "destination": "script",
    "reportOnly": false
  }
}
```

## Examples

In the following examples, assume that `oqVuAfXRKap7fdgcCY5uykM6+R9GqQ8K/uxy9rx7HNQlGYl1kPzQho1wx4JwY8wC` is already known to be the expected SHA-384 hash (digest) of a particular script `example-framework.js`, and there's a copy of the script hosted at `https://example.com/example-framework.js`.

### Subresource Integrity with the \<script> element

You can use the following {{HTMLElement("script")}} element to tell a browser that before executing the `https://example.com/example-framework.js` script, the browser must first compare the script to the expected hash, and verify that there's a match.

```html
<script
  src="https://example.com/example-framework.js"
  integrity="sha384-oqVuAfXRKap7fdgcCY5uykM6+R9GqQ8K/uxy9rx7HNQlGYl1kPzQho1wx4JwY8wC"
  crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

> [!NOTE]
> For more details on the purpose of the `crossorigin` attribute, see [CORS settings attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/crossorigin).

### Integrity enforcement with the `Integrity-Policy` header

You can add the {{httpheader("Integrity-Policy")}} header to your document to ensure that the external resources it loads (in this case, scripts) are loaded with integrity (and aren't loaded with [no-cors](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/mode#no-cors) mode)

```http
Integrity-Policy: blocked-destinations=(script), endpoints=(integrity-endpoint, some-other-integrity-endpoint)
```

If you're unsure that all the external scripts have integrity metadata, you can enable the report-only version of the feature and start getting reports of violations.
You can do that with the {{httpheader("Integrity-Policy-Report-Only")}} header.

```http
Integrity-Policy-Report-Only: blocked-destinations=(script), endpoints=(integrity-endpoint, some-other-integrity-endpoint)
```

# Transport Layer Security (TLS)

The security of any connection using Transport Layer Security (TLS) is heavily dependent upon the cipher suites and security parameters selected. This article's goal is to help you make these decisions to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of communication between client and server. The Mozilla Operations Security (OpSec) team [maintains a wiki entry](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS) with reference configurations for servers.

The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol is the standard for enabling two networked applications or devices to exchange information privately and robustly. Applications that use TLS can choose their security parameters, which can have a substantial impact on the security and reliability of data. This article provides an overview of TLS and the kinds of decisions you need to make when securing your content.

## History

When HTTPS was introduced, it was based on Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 2.0, a technology introduced by Netscape. It was updated to SSL 3.0 not long after, and as its usage expanded, it became clear that a common, standard encryption technology needed to be specified to ensure interoperability among all web browsers and servers. The [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://www.ietf.org/) (IETF) specified TLS 1.0 in {{RFC(2246)}} in January 1999. The current version of TLS is 1.3 ({{RFC(8446)}}).

Despite the fact that the web now uses TLS for encryption, many people still refer to it as "SSL" out of habit.

Although TLS can be used on top of any low-level transport protocol, the original goal of the protocol was to encrypt HTTP traffic. HTTP encrypted using TLS is commonly referred to as {{Glossary("HTTPS")}}. TLS-encrypted web traffic is by convention exchanged on port 443 by default, while unencrypted HTTP uses port 80 by default. HTTPS remains an important use case for TLS.

## HTTP over TLS

TLS provides three primary services that help ensure the safety and security of data exchanged with it:

- Authentication
  - : Authentication lets each party to the communication verify that the other party is who they claim to be.
- Encryption
  - : Data is encrypted while being transmitted between the user agent and the server, in order to prevent it from being read and interpreted by unauthorized parties.
- Integrity
  - : TLS ensures that between encrypting, transmitting, and decrypting the data, no information is lost, damaged, tampered with, or falsified.

A TLS connection starts with a handshake phase where a client and server agree on a shared secret and important parameters, like cipher suites, are negotiated. Once parameters and a data exchange mode where application data, such HTTP, is exchanged.

### Cipher suites

The primary parameters that the TLS handshake negotiates is a [cipher suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher_suite).

In TLS 1.2 and earlier, the negotiated cipher suite includes a set of cryptographic algorithms that together provide the negotiation of the shared secret, the means by which a server is authenticated, and the method that will be used to encrypt data.

The cipher suite in TLS 1.3 primarily governs the encryption of data, separate negotiation methods are used for key agreement and authentication.

Different software might use different names for the same cipher suites. For instance, the names used in OpenSSL and GnuTLS differ from those in the TLS standards. The [cipher names correspondence table](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Cipher_names_correspondence_table) on the Mozilla OpSec team's article on TLS configurations lists these names as well as information about compatibility and security levels.

### Configuring your server

Correctly configuring your server is crucial. In general, you should try to limit cipher support to the newest ciphers possible which are compatible with the browsers you want to be able to connect to your site. The [Mozilla OpSec guide to TLS configurations](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS) provides more information on recommended configurations.

To assist you in configuring your site, Mozilla provides a helpful [TLS configuration generator](https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/) that will generate configuration files for the following Web servers:

- Apache
- Nginx
- Lighttpd
- HAProxy
- Amazon Web Services CloudFormation Elastic Load Balancer

Using the [configurator](https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/) is a recommended way to create the configuration to meet your needs; then copy and paste it into the appropriate file on your server and restart the server to pick up the changes. The configuration file may need some adjustments to include custom settings, so be sure to review the generated configuration before using it; installing the configuration file without ensuring any references to domain names and the like are correct will result in a server that just doesn't work.

## TLS 1.3

{{RFC("8446", "TLS 1.3")}} is a major revision to TLS. TLS 1.3 includes numerous changes that improve security and performance. The goals of TLS 1.3 are:

- Remove unused and unsafe features of TLS 1.2.
- Include strong security analysis in the design.
- Improve privacy by encrypting more of the protocol.
- Reduce the time needed to complete a handshake.

TLS 1.3 changes much of the protocol fundamentals, but preserves almost all of the basic capabilities of previous TLS versions. For the web, TLS 1.3 can be enabled without affecting compatibility with some rare exceptions (see below).

The major changes in TLS 1.3 are:

- The TLS 1.3 handshake completes in one round trip in most cases, reducing handshake latency.
- A server can enable a 0-RTT (zero round trip time) handshake. Clients that reconnect to the server can send requests immediately, eliminating the latency of the TLS handshake entirely. Though the performance gains from 0-RTT can be significant, they come with some risk of replay attack, so some care is needed before enabling this feature.
- TLS 1.3 supports forward-secure modes only, unless the connection is resumed or it uses a pre-shared key.
- TLS 1.3 defines a new set of cipher suites that are exclusive to TLS 1.3. These cipher suites all use modern Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithms.
- The TLS 1.3 handshake is encrypted, except for the messages that are necessary to establish a shared secret. In particular, this means that server and client certificates are encrypted. Note however that the server identity (the server_name or SNI extension) that a client sends to the server is not encrypted.
- Numerous mechanisms have been disabled: renegotiation, generic data compression, [Digital Signature Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm) (DSA) certificates, static RSA key exchange, and key exchange with custom Diffie–Hellman (DH) groups.

Implementations of draft versions of TLS 1.3 are available. TLS 1.3 is enabled in some browsers, including the 0-RTT mode. Web servers that enable TLS 1.3 might need to adjust configuration to allow TLS 1.3 to operate successfully.

TLS 1.3 adds just one significant new use case. The 0-RTT handshake can provide significant performance gains for latency sensitive applications, like the web. Enabling 0-RTT requires additional steps, both to ensure successful deployment and to manage the risks of replay attacks.

The removal of renegotiation in TLS 1.3 might affect some web servers that rely on client authentication using certificates. Some web servers use renegotiation to either ensure that client certificates are encrypted, or to request client certificates only when certain resources are requested. For the privacy of client certificates, the encryption of the TLS 1.3 handshake ensures that client certificates are encrypted; however this might require some software changes. Reactive client authentication using certificates is supported by TLS 1.3 but not widely implemented. Alternative mechanisms are in the process of being developed, which will also support HTTP/2.

## Retiring old TLS versions

To help with working towards a more modern, more secure web, all major browsers began removing support for TLS 1.0 and 1.1 in early 2020. You'll need to make sure your web server supports TLS 1.2 or 1.3 going forward.

From version 74 onwards, Firefox will return a [Secure Connection Failed](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/secure-connection-failed-firefox-did-not-connect) error when connecting to servers using the older TLS versions ([Firefox bug 1606734](https://bugzil.la/1606734)).

## TLS handshake timeout values

If the TLS handshake starts to become slow or unresponsive for some reason, the user's experience can be affected significantly. To mitigate this problem, modern browsers have implemented handshake timeouts:

- Since version 58, Firefox implements a TLS handshake timeout with a default value of 30 seconds. The timeout value can be varied by editing the `network.http.tls-handshake-timeout` pref in about:config.

# Features gated by user activation

To ensure applications are unable to abuse APIs that can create a bad user experience when the behavior is not desired, some APIs can only be used when the user is in an "active interaction" state, meaning the user is currently interacting with the web page, or has interacted with the page at least once.
Browsers limit access to sensitive APIs like popups, fullscreen, or vibration APIs to active user interactions to prevent malicious scripts from abusing these features.
This page lists web platform features available only after user activation.

A user activation either implies that the user is currently interacting with the page, or has completed an interaction since page load.
Typically, this is a click on a button or some other interaction with the UI.

More precisely, an _activation triggering input event_ is an event which:

- has the [`isTrusted`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/isTrusted) attribute set to `true`, and
- is one of the following types:
  - [`keydown`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/keydown_event) (except for the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key nor a shortcut key reserved by the user agent)
  - [`mousedown`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mousedown_event)
  - [`pointerdown`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/pointerdown_event) (if `pointerType` is "mouse")
  - [`pointerup`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/pointerup_event) (if `pointerType` is not "mouse")
  - [`touchend`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/touchend_event)

If an activation has been triggered, the user agent differentiates between two types of user activation window states: sticky and transient.

## Comparison between transient and sticky activation

The difference between transient and sticky activation is that transient activation only lasts for a short while, and may in some cases be consumed (deactivated) when a protected feature is used, while sticky activation persists until the end of the session.

Gating features on transient activation ensures that they are only available if directly triggered by a user.
Sticky activation, by contrast, is primarily used to restrict features that should not automatically trigger on page load, such as popups.

## Transient activation

{{Glossary("Transient activation")}} is a window state that indicates a user has recently pressed a button or performed some other user interaction.
Transient activation expires after a timeout (if not renewed by further interaction) and may also be consumed by some APIs (like {{domxref("Window.open()")}}).

APIs that require transient activation (list is not exhaustive):

- {{domxref("Clients.openWindow()")}}
- {{domxref("Clipboard.read()")}}
- {{domxref("Clipboard.readText()")}}
- {{domxref("Clipboard.write()")}}
- {{domxref("Clipboard.writeText()")}}
- {{domxref("ContactsManager.select()")}}
- {{domxref("Document.requestStorageAccess()")}}
- {{domxref("DocumentPictureInPicture.requestWindow()")}}
- {{domxref("Element.requestFullScreen()")}}
- {{domxref("Element.requestPointerLock()")}}
- {{domxref("EyeDropper.open()")}}
- {{domxref("HID.requestDevice()")}}
- {{domxref("HTMLInputElement.showPicker()")}}
- {{domxref("HTMLSelectElement.showPicker()")}}
- {{domxref("HTMLVideoElement.requestPictureInPicture()")}}
- {{domxref("IdleDetector/requestPermission_static", "IdleDetector.requestPermission()")}}
- {{domxref("Keyboard.lock()")}}
- {{domxref("MediaDevices.getDisplayMedia()")}}
- `MediaDevices.getViewportMedia()`
- {{domxref("MediaDevices.selectAudioOutput()")}}
- `MediaStreamTrack.sendCaptureAction()`
- {{domxref("Navigator.share()")}}
- {{domxref("PaymentRequest.show()")}}
- {{domxref("PresentationRequest.start()")}}
- {{domxref("RemotePlayback.prompt()")}}
- {{domxref("Serial.requestPort()")}}
- {{domxref("USB.requestDevice()")}}
- {{domxref("Window.getScreenDetails()")}}
- {{domxref("Window.open()")}}

- {{domxref("Window.showDirectoryPicker()")}}
- {{domxref("Window.showOpenFilePicker()")}}
- {{domxref("Window.showSaveFilePicker()")}}
- {{domxref("WindowClient.focus()")}}
- {{domxref("XRSystem.requestSession()")}}

## Sticky activation

{{Glossary("Sticky activation")}} is a window state that indicates a user has at some time in the session pressed a button, used a menu, or performed some other user interaction.
It is not reset after it has been set initially (unlike transient activation).

APIs that require sticky activation (not exhaustive):

- {{domxref("Window/beforeunload_event", "beforeunload")}} event
- {{domxref("Navigator.vibrate()")}}
- {{domxref("VirtualKeyboard.show()")}}
- Autoplay of [Media and Web Audio APIs](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Autoplay) (in particular for [`AudioContexts`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext)).

## UserActivation API

To programmatically determine if a window has either sticky or transient user activation, the {{domxref("UserActivation")}} API provides two properties which are available using {{domxref("navigator.userActivation")}}:

- {{domxref("UserActivation.hasBeenActive")}} indicates whether the window has sticky user activation.
- {{domxref("UserActivation.isActive")}} indicates whether the window has transient user activation.

# Weak signature algorithms

The strength of the hash algorithm used in {{Glossary("Signature/Security", "signing")}} a {{Glossary("Digital certificate", "digital certificate")}} is a critical element of the security of the certificate. This article provides some information about signature algorithms known to be weak, so you can avoid them when appropriate.

Weaknesses in hash algorithms can lead to situations in which attackers can create or obtain fraudulent certificates. As new attacks are found and improvements in available technology make attacks more feasible, the use of older algorithms is discouraged and support for them is eventually removed.

## SHA-1

SHA-1 certificates will no longer be treated as secure by major browser manufacturers beginning in 2017. Certificates employing more secure hash algorithms (such as SHA-256 or SHA-512) should be used instead.

## MD5

Support for MD5 based signatures was removed in early 2012.

# Applying SVG effects to HTML content

Modern browsers support using [SVG](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) within [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) styles to apply graphical effects to HTML content.

You may specify SVG in styles either within the same document or an external style sheet. There are 3 properties you can use: [`mask`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask), [`clip-path`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path), and [`filter`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter).

> [!NOTE]
> References to SVG in external files must be to the [same origin](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) as the referencing document.

## Using embedded SVG

To apply an SVG effect using CSS styles, you first need to create the CSS style that references the SVG to apply.

```css
p {
  mask: url("#my-mask");
}
```

In the above example, all paragraphs are masked by an [SVG `<mask>`](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/mask) with the [ID](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/id) `my-mask`.

### Example: Masking

For example, you can make a gradient mask for HTML content using SVG and CSS code similar to the following, inside your HTML document:

```html
<svg height="0">
  <mask id="mask-1">
    <linearGradient id="gradient-1" y2="1">
      <stop stop-color="white" offset="0" />
      <stop stop-opacity="0" offset="1" />
    </linearGradient>
    <circle cx="0.25" cy="0.25" r="0.25" id="circle" fill="white" />
    <rect x="0.5" y="0.2" width="300" height="100" fill="url(#gradient-1)" />
  </mask>
</svg>
```

```css
.target {
  mask: url("#mask-1");
}
p {
  width: 300px;
  border: 1px solid black;
  display: inline-block;
}
p.target {
  background: lime;
}
```

Note that in the CSS, the mask is specified using a URL to the ID `#mask-1`, which is the ID of the SVG mask specified below it. Everything else specifies details about the gradient mask itself.

Applying the SVG effect to HTML is accomplished by assigning the `target` class defined above to an element, like this:

```html
<p class="target">
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod
  tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam.
</p>
<p>
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing
  <em class="target"
    >elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna
    aliqua.</em
  >
  Ut enim ad minim veniam.
</p>
```

The above example would be rendered with the mask applied to it.

{{EmbedLiveSample('Example_Masking', 650, 200)}}

### Example: Clipping

This example demonstrates using SVG to clip HTML content. Notice that even the clickable areas for links are clipped.

```html
<p class="target">
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod
  tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam.
</p>
<p>
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing
  <em class="target"
    >elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna
    aliqua.</em
  >
  Ut enim ad minim veniam.
</p>

<button>Toggle radius</button>

<svg height="0">
  <clipPath id="clipping-path-1" clipPathUnits="objectBoundingBox">
    <circle cx="0.25" cy="0.25" r="0.25" id="circle" />
    <rect x="0.5" y="0.2" width="0.5" height="0.8" />
  </clipPath>
</svg>
```

```css
.target {
  clip-path: url("#clipping-path-1");
}
p {
  width: 300px;
  border: 1px solid black;
  display: inline-block;
}
p.target {
  background: lime;
}
```

This establishes a clipping area made of a circle and rectangle, assigns it the ID `#clipping-path-1`, then references it in the CSS. The clip path can be assigned to any element with the `target` class.

You can make changes to the SVG in real time and see them immediately affect the rendering of the HTML. For example, you can resize the circle in the clip path established above:

```js
const circle = document.getElementById("circle");

function toggleRadius() {
  circle.r.baseVal.value = 0.4 - circle.r.baseVal.value;
}

document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", toggleRadius);
```

### Example: Filtering

This demonstrates applying a filter to HTML content using SVG. It establishes several filters, which are applied with CSS to three elements in both the normal and mouse [hover](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:hover) states.

```html
<p class="target">
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod
  tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam.
</p>
<pre class="target">lorem</pre>
<p>
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing
  <em class="target"
    >elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna
    aliqua.</em
  >
  Ut enim ad minim veniam.
</p>
```

```css hidden
p.target {
  background: lime;
}
```

Any SVG filter can be applied this way. For example, to apply a blur effect, you might use:

```html
<svg height="0">
  <filter id="f1">
    <feGaussianBlur stdDeviation="3" />
  </filter>
</svg>
```

You could also apply a color matrix:

```html
<svg height="0">
  <filter id="f2">
    <feColorMatrix
      values="0.3333 0.3333 0.3333 0 0
              0.3333 0.3333 0.3333 0 0
              0.3333 0.3333 0.3333 0 0
              0      0      0      1 0" />
  </filter>
</svg>
```

And some more filters:

```html
<svg height="0">
  <filter id="f3">
    <feConvolveMatrix
      filterRes="100 100"
      color-interpolation-filters="sRGB"
      order="3"
      kernelMatrix="0 -1 0
                   -1 4 -1
                    0 -1 0"
      preserveAlpha="true" />
  </filter>
  <filter id="f4">
    <feSpecularLighting
      surfaceScale="5"
      specularConstant="1"
      specularExponent="10"
      lighting-color="white">
      <fePointLight x="-5000" y="-10000" z="20000" />
    </feSpecularLighting>
  </filter>
  <filter id="f5">
    <feColorMatrix
      values="1 0 0 0 0
              0 1 0 0 0
              0 0 1 0 0
              0 1 0 0 0"
      color-interpolation-filters="sRGB" />
  </filter>
</svg>
```

The five filters are applied using the following CSS:

```css
p.target {
  filter: url("#f3");
}
p.target:hover {
  filter: url("#f5");
}
em.target {
  filter: url("#f1");
}
em.target:hover {
  filter: url("#f4");
}
pre.target {
  filter: url("#f2");
}
pre.target:hover {
  filter: url("#f3");
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Example_Filtering', 650, 200)}}

### Example: Blurred Text

In order to blur text, there is a CSS filter function called [`blur()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter-function/blur). You can achieve the same effect using SVG filters.

```html
<p class="blur">Time to clean my glasses</p>
<svg height="0">
  <defs>
    <filter id="wherearemyglasses" x="0" y="0">
      <feGaussianBlur in="SourceGraphic" stdDeviation="1" />
    </filter>
  </defs>
</svg>
```

You can apply the SVG and the CSS filter in the same class:

```css
.blur {
  filter: url("#wherearemyglasses");
}
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Example_Blurred_Text', 300, 100) }}

Blurring is computation heavy, so ensure to use it sparingly, especially in elements that get scrolled or animated.

### Example: Text Effects

SVG effects can also be used to add a more dynamic and flexible approach to adding text compared to plain HTML text.

By creating the text using SVG elements combined with HTML you can make a variety of different text effects. You can rotate the text:

```html
<svg height="60" width="200">
  <text x="0" y="15" fill="blue" transform="rotate(30 20,50)">
    Example text
  </text>
</svg>
```

## Using external references

SVG used for clipping, masking, and filtering can be loaded from an external source, as long as that source comes from the same origin as the HTML document to which it's applied.

For example, if your CSS is in a file named `default.css`, it can look like this:

```css
.target {
  clip-path: url("resources.svg#c1");
}
```

The SVG is then imported from a file named `resources.svg`, using the clip path with the ID `c1`.

# Content type

SVG makes use of a number of data types. This article lists these types along with their syntax and descriptions of what they're used for.

## Angle

- \<angle>
  - : Angles are specified in one of two ways. When used in the value of a property in a stylesheet, an \<angle> is defined as follows:

    ```plain
    angle ::= number (~"deg" | ~"grad" | ~"rad")?
    ```

    where `deg` indicates degrees, `grad` indicates grads and `rad` indicates radians.

    For properties defined in CSS2, an angle unit identifier must be provided. For angle values in SVG-specific properties and their corresponding presentation attributes, the angle unit identifier is optional. If not provided, the angle value is assumed to be in degrees. In presentation attributes for all properties, whether defined in SVG1.1 or in CSS2, the angle identifier, if specified, must be in lower case.

    When angles are used in an SVG attribute, \<angle> is instead defined as follows:

    ```plain
    angle ::= number ("deg" | "grad" | "rad")?
    ```

    The unit identifiers in such \<angle> values must be in lower case.

    In the SVG DOM, \<angle> values are represented using {{domxref("SVGAngle")}} or {{domxref("SVGAnimatedAngle")}} objects.

## Anything

- \<anything>
  - : The basic type \<anything> is a sequence of zero or more characters. Specifically:

    ```plain
    anything ::= Char*
    ```

    where Char is any valid non-control Unicode character.

## Clock-value

- \<clock-value>
  - : Clock values have the same syntax as in [SMIL Animation](https://www.w3.org/TR/smil-animation/#Timing-ClockValueSyntax) specification. The grammar for clock values is repeated here:

    ```plain
    Clock-val         ::= Full-clock-val | Partial-clock-val
                          | Timecount-val
    Full-clock-val    ::= Hours ":" Minutes ":" Seconds ("." Fraction)?
    Partial-clock-val ::= Minutes ":" Seconds ("." Fraction)?
    Timecount-val     ::= Timecount ("." Fraction)? (Metric)?
    Metric            ::= "h" | "min" | "s" | "ms"
    Hours             ::= DIGIT+; any positive number
    Minutes           ::= 2DIGIT; range from 00 to 59
    Seconds           ::= 2DIGIT; range from 00 to 59
    Fraction          ::= DIGIT+
    Timecount         ::= DIGIT+
    2DIGIT            ::= DIGIT DIGIT
    DIGIT             ::= [0-9]
    ```

    For `Timecount` values, the default metric suffix is `s` (for seconds). No embedded white space is allowed in clock values, although leading and trailing white space characters will be ignored.

    The following are examples of legal clock values:
    - Full clock values:
      - `02:30:03` = 2 hours, 30 minutes and 3 seconds
      - `50:00:10.25` = 50 hours, 10 seconds and 250 milliseconds
    - Partial clock value:
      - `02:33` = 2 minutes and 33 seconds
      - `00:10.5` = 10.5 seconds = 10 seconds and 500 milliseconds
    - Timecount values:
      - `3.2h` = 3.2 hours = 3 hours and 12 minutes
      - `45min` = 45 minutes
      - `30s` = 30 seconds
      - `5ms` = 5 milliseconds
      - `12.467` = 12 seconds and 467 milliseconds
    - Fractional values are just (base 10) floating point definitions of seconds. Thus:
      - `00.5s` = 500 milliseconds
      - `00:00.005` = 5 milliseconds

## Color

- \<color>
  - : The basic type \<color> is a CSS2 compatible specification for a color in the sRGB color space. \<color> applies to SVG's use of the {{SVGAttr("color")}} attribute and is a component of the definitions of attributes {{SVGAttr("fill")}}, {{SVGAttr("stroke")}}, {{SVGAttr("stop-color")}}, {{SVGAttr("flood-color")}}, and {{SVGAttr("lighting-color")}}, which also offer optional ICC-based color specifications.

    The definition of \<color> in SVG is exactly the same as the CSS {{cssxref("color_value", "&lt;color&gt;")}} definition.

## Coordinate

- \<coordinate>
  - : A \<coordinate> is a length in the user coordinate system that is the given distance from the origin of the user coordinate system along the relevant axis (the x-axis for X coordinates, the y-axis for Y coordinates). Its syntax is the same as that for [\<length>](#length).

    Within the SVG DOM, a \<coordinate> is represented as an {{domxref("SVGLength")}} or an {{domxref("SVGAnimatedLength")}}.

## Frequency

- \<frequency>
  - : Frequency values are used with aural properties. As defined in CSS2, a frequency value is a [\<number>](#number) immediately followed by a frequency unit identifier. The frequency unit identifiers are:
    - `Hz`: Hertz
    - `kHz`: kilo Hertz

    Frequency values may not be negative.

## FuncIRI

- \<FuncIRI>
  - : Functional notation for a reference. The syntax for this reference is the same as the [CSS URI](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/url_value).

## Integer

- \<integer>
  - : An \<integer> is specified as an optional sign character (`+` or `-`) followed by one or more digits `0` to `9`:

    ```plain
    integer ::= [+-]? [0-9]+
    ```

    If the sign character is not present, the number is non-negative.

    Unless stated otherwise for a particular attribute or property, the range for an \<integer> encompasses (at a minimum) `-2147483648` to `2147483647`.

    Within the SVG DOM, an \<integer> is represented as a `number` or an {{domxref("SVGAnimatedInteger")}}.

## IRI

- \<IRI>
  - : An **I**nternationalized **R**esource **I**dentifier.

    On the Internet, resources are identified using _IRIs_ (Internationalized Resource Identifiers). For example, an SVG file called `someDrawing.svg` located at `http://example.com` might have the following _IRI_:

    ```plain
    http://example.com/someDrawing.svg
    ```

    An _IRI_ can also address a particular element within an XML document by including an _IRI_ fragment identifier as part of the _IRI_. An _IRI_ which includes an _IRI_ fragment identifier consists of an optional base _IRI_, followed by a `#` character, followed by the _IRI_ fragment identifier. For example, the following _IRI_ can be used to specify the element whose ID is `Lamppost` within file `someDrawing.svg`:

    ```plain
    http://example.com/someDrawing.svg#Lamppost
    ```

    _IRIs_ are used in the {{SVGAttr("href")}} attribute.
    Some attributes allow both _IRIs_ and text strings as content. To disambiguate a text string from a relative IRI, the functional notation \<FuncIRI> is used. This is an _IRI_ delimited with a functional notation. Note: For historical reasons, the delimiters are `url(` and `)`, for compatibility with the CSS specifications. The _FuncIRI_ form is used in presentation attributes.

    SVG makes extensive use of _IRI_ references, both absolute and relative, to other objects. For example, to fill a rectangle with a linear gradient, you first define a {{SVGElement("linearGradient")}} element and give it an ID, as in:

    ```html
    <linearGradient xml:id="MyGradient">...</linearGradient>
    ```

    You then reference the linear gradient as the value of the {{SVGAttr("fill")}} attribute for the rectangle, as in the following example:

    ```html
    <rect fill="url(#MyGradient)" />
    ```

    SVG supports two types of _IRI_ references:
    - **local _IRI_ references**, where the IRI reference does not contain an \<absoluteIRI> or \<relativeIRI> and thus only contains a fragment identifier (i.e., `#<elementID>` or `#xpointer(id<elementID>)`).
    - **non-local _IRI_ references**, where the _IRI_ reference does contain an \<absoluteIRI> or \<relativeIRI>.

    IRI is now a retired concept in SVG 2, replaced by the universal [URL](#url) type.

## Length

- \<length>
  - : A length is a distance measurement, given as a number along with a unit.
    The SVG2 specification aligns with CSS {{cssxref("length")}} data types and units for the attribute syntax and values.
    A length unit identifier must be provided and the values of the length unit identifiers are case-insensitive.
    The syntax follows the CSS `<length>` syntax:

    ```plain
    length ::= <number> (<absolute-length> | <relative-length>)?
    ```

    For SVG-specific properties defined in SVG1.1 and their corresponding presentation attributes, the unit identifiers in values are optional. If not provided, the length value represents a distance in the current user coordinate system. Length identifiers must be in lower case when used in presentation attributes for all properties whether they are defined in SVG or in CSS. This case sensitivity is relaxed in SVG2 to align with CSS.

    Note that the non-property \<length> definition also allows a percentage (`%`) unit identifier.
    The meaning of a percentage length value depends on the attribute for which the percentage length value has been specified. Two common cases are:
    - when a percentage length value represents a percentage of the viewport width or height
    - when a percentage length value represents a percentage of the bounding box width or height on a given object.

    In the SVG DOM, \<length> values are represented using {{domxref("SVGLength")}} or {{domxref("SVGAnimatedLength")}} objects.

## List-of-Ts

- \<list-of-Ts>
  - : (Where _T_ is some type.) A list consists of a separated sequence of values. Unless explicitly described differently, lists within SVG's XML attributes can be either comma-separated (with optional white space before or after the comma), or white space-separated.

    White space in lists is defined as one or more of the following consecutive characters: "space" (`U+0020`), "tab" (`U+0009`), "line feed" (`U+000A`), "carriage return" (`U+000D`), and "form-feed" (`U+000C`).

    The following is a template for an EBNF grammar describing the \<list-of-Ts> syntax:

    ```plain
    list-of-Ts ::= T
                    | T, list-of-Ts
    ```

    Within the SVG DOM, values of a \<list-of-Ts> type are represented by an interface specific for the particular type _T_. For example, a \<list-of-lengths> is represented in the SVG DOM using an {{domxref("SVGLengthList")}} or {{domxref("SVGAnimatedLengthList")}} object.

## Name

- \<name>
  - : A name, which is a string where a few characters of syntactic significance are disallowed.

    ```plain
    name  ::= [^,()#x20#x9#xD#xA] /* any char except ",", "(", ")" or wsp */
    ```

## Number

- \<number>
  - : Real numbers are specified in one of two ways. When used in a stylesheet, a \<number> is defined as follows:

    ```plain
    number ::= integer
                | [+-]? [0-9]* "." [0-9]+
    ```

    This syntax is the same as the definition in CSS (CSS2, section 4.3.1).

    When used in an SVG attribute, a \<number> is defined differently, to allow numbers with large magnitudes to be specified more concisely:

    ```plain
    number ::= integer ([Ee] integer)?
                | [+-]? [0-9]* "." [0-9]+ ([Ee] integer)?
    ```

    Within the SVG DOM, a \<number> is represented as a float, {{domxref("SVGNumber")}} or a {{domxref("SVGAnimatedNumber")}}.

## Number-optional-number

- \<number-optional-number>
  - : A pair of \<number>s, where the second \<number> is optional.

    ```plain
    number-optional-number ::= number
                                | number, number
    ```

    In the SVG DOM, a \<number-optional-number> is represented using a pair of {{domxref("SVGAnimatedInteger")}} or {{domxref("SVGAnimatedNumber")}} objects.

## Opacity value

- \<opacity-value>
  - : The opacity of the color or the content the current object is filled with, as a [\<number>](#number). Any values outside the range `0.0` (fully transparent) to `1.0` (fully opaque) will be clamped to this range.

## Paint

- \<paint>
  - : The values for properties {{SVGAttr("fill")}} and {{SVGAttr("stroke")}} define the type of paint to use when filling or stroking a given graphics element.
    The available options and syntax for \<paint> are:

    ```plain
    paint ::= none | <color> | <url> [none | <color>]? | context-fill | context-stroke
    ```

    The `context-fill` and `context-stroke` values allow for inheriting values in [marker](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/marker) and [use](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/use) elements.

## Percentage

- \<percentage>
  - : Percentages are specified as a number followed by a `%` character:

    ```plain
    percentage ::= number "%"
    ```

    Note that the definition of \<number> depends on whether the percentage is specified in a stylesheet or in an attribute that is not also a presentation attribute.

    Percentage values are always relative to another value (for example, a length). Each attribute or property that allows percentages also defines the reference distance measurement to which the percentage refers.

    Within the SVG DOM, a \<percentage> is represented using an {{domxref("SVGNumber")}} or {{domxref("SVGAnimatedNumber")}} object.

## Time

- \<time>
  - : A time value is a \<number> immediately followed by a time unit identifier. The time unit identifiers are:
    - `ms`: milliseconds
    - `s`: seconds

## Transform-list

- \<transform-list>
  - : A \<transform-list> is used to specify a list of coordinate system transformations. A detailed description of the possible values for a \<transform-list> is given in the {{SVGAttr("transform")}} attribute definition.

    Within the SVG DOM, a \<transform-list> value is represented using an {{domxref("SVGTransformList")}} or {{domxref("SVGAnimatedTransformList")}} object.

## URL

- URL
  - : A **U**niform **R**esource **L**ocator.

    A URL is a sequence of {{Glossary("Unicode")}} characters, building an address to an internal or external resource.

    Before SVG 2, the more limited [IRI](#iri) content type was used instead, because the URL specification was not standardized before.

# Linking

The {{SVGAttr("target")}} attribute on the SVG {{SVGElement("a")}} element doesn't work in Mozilla Firefox 1.5. When SVG documents are embedded within a parent HTML document using the tag:

page1.html:

```html
<html lang="en">
  <body>
    <p>This is a SVG button:</p>
    <object
      width="100"
      height="50"
      type="image/svg+xml"
      data="button.svg"></object>
  </body>
</html>
```

button.svg:

```xml
<?xml version="1.1" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <a href="page2.html" target="_top">
    <g>
      <!-- button graphical elements here -->
    </g>
  </a>
</svg>
```

The specification says that the browser should navigate to the HTML document page2.html when the button graphics are clicked. However, `target` does not work with Mozilla's implementation of the SVG `<a>` element in Firefox 1.5. (The problem will be fixed in Firefox 2.0.)

Anyway, the resultant behavior in Moz SVG is that page2.html will be loaded into the frame where the SVG button was (i.e., you would now have page2.html embedded inside a 100x50 pixel frame inside page1.html).

To get around this, requires a little ugly JavaScript hacking:

button.svg:

```xml
<?xml version="1.1" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <g onclick="top.document.href='page2.html'" cursor="pointer">
    <!-- button graphical elements here -->
  </g>
</svg>
```

## Example

For an example of this solution at work see [www.codedread.com](https://www.codedread.com/).
# Example

In this example, we use [XHTML](/en-US/docs/Glossary/XHTML), [SVG](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG), [JavaScript](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), and the [DOM](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) to animate a swarm of "motes". These motes are governed by two basic principles. First, each mote tries to move towards the mouse cursor, and second each mote tries to move away from the average mote position. Combined, we get this very natural-looking behavior.

[View the example](https://mdn.dev/archives/media/samples/svg/swarm-of-motes.xhtml). The linked example was written with 2006 best practices. The example below has been updated to modern JavaScript best practices. Both work.

# Namespaces crash course

As an [XML](/en-US/docs/Glossary/XML) dialect, [SVG](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) is namespaced. It is important to understand the concept of namespaces and how they are used if you plan to author SVG content. Namespaces are essential to user agents that support multiple XML dialects; browsers must be very strict. Taking the time to understand namespaces now will save you from future headaches.

### Background

A long-standing goal of the various W3C specifications is to make it possible for different types of XML-based content to be mixed together in the same XML or HTML file. For example, SVG and [MathML](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML) might be incorporated directly into an HTML based scientific document. Being able to mix content types like this has many advantages, but it also required a very real problem to be solved.

Naturally, each XML dialect defines the meaning of the markup element names described in its specification. The problem with mixing content from different XML dialects in a single document is that the elements defined by one dialect may have the same name as elements defined by another. For example, both HTML and SVG have a `<title>` element. How does the user agent distinguish between the two? How do CSS styles distinguish between the two? In fact, how does the user agent tell when content is something it knows about, and not just a meaningless undefined HTML custom element or an XML file containing arbitrary element names unknown to it?

Contrary to popular opinion, the answer to this question is not "it can tell from the `DOCTYPE` declaration". DTDs were never designed with mixed content in mind, and past attempts to create mixed content DTDs are now considered to have failed. XML, and some XML dialects (SVG and HTML included), don't require a `DOCTYPE` declaration. SVG 1.2 doesn't even have one. The fact that `DOCTYPE` declarations (usually) match the content in single content-type files is merely coincidental. DTDs are for validation only, not identification of content. Any user agent that identifies XML content using its `DOCTYPE` declaration is unreliable.

The real answer to the question is that XML content tells the user agent which dialect the element names belong to by giving them explicit "namespace declarations".

### Declaring namespaces

So what do these namespace declarations look like, and where do they go? Here is a short example.

```svg
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <!-- more tags here -->
</svg>
```

The namespace declaration is provided by the `xmlns` parameter. This parameter says that the `<svg>` element and its child elements belong to whichever XML dialect has the namespace name `http://www.w3.org/2000/svg` which is, of course, SVG. Note that the namespace declaration is only provided once on a root element (and is implied if omitted). The declaration defines the _default_ namespace, so the user agent knows that all the `<svg>` element's descendants also belong to the same namespace. User agents check to see if they recognize the namespace name to determine if they know how to handle the markup.

Note that namespace names are just strings, so the fact that the SVG namespace name also looks like a URI isn't important. URIs are commonly used because they are unique, but the intention is not to "link" somewhere. (In fact, URIs are used so frequently that the term "namespace URI" is commonly used instead of "namespace name".)

#### Redeclaring the default namespace

If all the descendants of the root element are also defined to be in the default namespace, how do you mix in content from another namespace? To include the SVG namespace in HTML, you include `<svg>`. In XML, you declare a namespace. Here's a short example.

```xml
<report xmlns="https://www.acme.org/reports">
  <title>Some stats</title>
  <summary>...</summary>
  <statTable xmlns="https://www.acme.org/tables">
    <content>...</content>
    <!-- redeclaring root's default namespace -->
    <summary xmlns="https://www.acme.org/reports">...</summary>
  </statTable>
</report>
```

In this example, the `xmlns` attribute on the root `<report>` element declares the default namespace to be `https://www.acme.org/reports`, or `reports`. As a result, it and all its child elements are interpreted by the user agent as belonging to `reports`, except for the `<content>` element, which exists in the `https://www.acme.org/tables`, or `tables`, namespace. The `<summary>` element has its own `xmlns` parameter, and by redeclaring the `reports` namespace, this tells the user agent that the `<summary>` element and its descendants (unless they also redeclare an alternative namespace) belong to `reports`.

With HTML, `http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml` is the implied namespace. With SVG, it is `http://www.w3.org/2000/svg`. MathML is `http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML`.

#### Declaring namespace prefixes

XML dialects not only define their own elements, but they also declare their own parameters.

By default, parameters don't have a namespace at all. They are only known to be unique because they appear on an element that itself has a unique name. However, sometimes it is necessary to define parameters so that they can be reused on many different elements and still be considered to be the same parameter, independently of the element with which they are used. A very good example of this is the `href` parameter defined by the {{glossary("XLink")}} specification. This parameter is commonly used by other XML dialects as a means to link to external resources. But how do you tell the user agent which dialect the parameter belongs to, in this case `XLink`? Consider the following example.

```xml
<svg
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
  <script xlink:href="cool-script.js" type="text/javascript" />
</svg>
```

This example has the rather unusual-looking parameter `xmlns:xlink`. As you may guess from the first `xmlns` part, this is another namespace declaration. However, instead of setting the default namespace, this namespace declaration sets the namespace for something called a "[namespace prefix](/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSNamespaceRule/prefix)". In this case, we have chosen to use the prefix `xlink` (the second part) since the prefix will be used to tell the user agent about attributes that belong to `XLink`.

As their name suggests, namespace prefixes are used to prefix parameter and element names. This is done by putting the namespace prefix and a colon before the parameter name as shown on the `<script>` element in the example above. This tells the user agent that the particular parameter belongs to the namespace assigned to the namespace prefix (`XLink`), and is a parameter that can be used with the same meaning on other elements.

Note that, in XML, it is an XML error to use a prefix that hasn't been bound to a namespace name. The binding created by the `xmlns:xlink` parameter in the example above is required for the `xlink:href` parameter to not cause an error. This XLink parameter is also frequently used in SVG on the `<a>`, `<use>` and `<image>` elements among others, so it's a good idea to always include the XLink declaration in your documents.

As an aside, it's useful to know that namespace prefixes can also be used for element names. This tells the user agent that the particular element (but not its children this time!) belongs to the namespace assigned to the prefix. Knowing this will save you some confusion if you come across markup like in the following example:

```xml
<html
  lang="en"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
  xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <body>
    <h1>SVG embedded inline in XHTML</h1>
    <svg:svg width="300px" height="200px">
      <svg:circle cx="150" cy="100" r="50" fill="red" />
    </svg:svg>
  </body>
</html>
```

> [!NOTE]
> This is an {{Glossary("XHTML")}} file, not an HTML file. XML namespaces are not valid in HTML. To try this example, you have to save your file as `.xhtml`.

Note that because a namespace prefix is used for the `<svg:svg>` element and its child `<svg:circle>`, it wasn't necessary to redeclare the default namespace. In general, it is better to redeclare the default namespace rather than prefix lots of elements in this way.

### Scripting in namespaced XML

Namespaces affect markup and scripting ([and even CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_namespaces)). If you write scripts for namespaced XML such as SVG, read on.

The [DOM Level 1](https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-1/) recommendation was created before the [original Namespaces in XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names/) recommendation was released; therefore, DOM1 isn't namespace-aware. This causes problems for namespaced XML such as SVG. To resolve these problems, [DOM Level 2 Core](https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/) added namespace-aware equivalents of all the applicable DOM Level 1 methods. When scripting SVG, it is important to use the [namespace-aware methods](https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/core.html#Namespaces-Considerations). The table below lists the DOM1 methods that shouldn't be used in SVG, along with their equivalent DOM2 counterparts that should be used instead.

</table>

The first parameter for all the DOM2 namespace-aware methods must be the namespace name (also known as the namespace URI) of the element or parameter in question. For SVG **elements** this is `http://www.w3.org/2000/svg`. However, note carefully: the [Namespaces in XML 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names11/#defaulting) recommendation states that the namespace name for parameters without a prefix does not have a value. In other words, although the parameters belong to the namespace of the element, you do not use the tag's namespace name. Instead, **you must use null as the namespace name for unqualified (prefixless) parameters**. So, to create an SVG `rect` _element_ using `document.createElementNS()`, you must write:

```js
document.createElementNS("http://www.w3.org/2000/svg", "rect");
```

But to retrieve the value of the `x` _parameter_ on an SVG `rect` element, you must write:

```js
rect.getAttributeNS(null, "x");
```

Note that this isn't the case for parameters _with_ a namespace prefix (parameters that don't belong to the same XML dialect as the element). Parameters such as `xlink:href` require the namespace name that was assigned to that prefix (`http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink` for XLink). Hence to get the value of the `xlink:href` parameter of an `<a>` element in SVG you would write:

```js
elt.getAttributeNS("http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "href");
```

For setting parameters that have a namespace, it is recommended (but not required) that you also include their prefix in the second parameter so that the DOM can later be more easily converted back to XML (if, for instance, you want to send it back to the server). For example:

```js
elt.setAttributeNS(
  "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink",
  "xlink:href",
  "other-doc.svg",
);
```

As a final example, here's a demonstration of how you could dynamically create an `<image>` element using JavaScript:

```js
const SVG_NS = "http://www.w3.org/2000/svg";
const XLink_NS = "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink";
const image = document.createElementNS(SVG_NS, "image");
image.setAttributeNS(null, "width", "100");
image.setAttributeNS(null, "height", "100");
image.setAttributeNS(XLink_NS, "xlink:href", "flower.png");
```

### Conclusion

For SVG, HTML, and MathML, the namespace is implied and therefore optional. It is required to declare the namespace for XML files. If you don't, user agents will not recognize the content and will show the XML markup or inform the user that there's an error in the XML.

When writing SVG, it is helpful to use a template that includes all the commonly used namespace declarations when creating new files. If you don't already have one, make one up starting with the following code:

```xml
<svg
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"></svg>
```

Even if you don't use all those namespaces in a particular document, there's no harm in including the namespace declarations. It may save you from some annoying errors if you end up adding content from one of the unused namespaces at a later date.

### A full example

For a full example see [SVG: Namespaces Crash Course: Example](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Guides/Namespaces_crash_course/Example).
# Scripting

There are several ways to create and manipulate SVG using JavaScript.
This document describes event handling, interactivity and working with embedded SVG content.

One can override default browser behaviors with the `evt.preventDefault()` method, add event listeners to objects with the syntax `element.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture)`, and set element properties with syntax like `svgElement.style.setProperty("fill-opacity", "0.0", "")`. Note the existence of all three arguments setting properties.

### Preventing default behavior in event code

When writing drag and drop code, sometimes you'll find that text on the page gets accidentally selected while dragging. Or if you want to use the backspace key in your code, you want to override the browser's default behavior when the backspace key is pressed, which is to go back to the previous page. The `evt.preventDefault()` method lets you do this.

### Using `eventListeners` with objects

The methods `addEventListener()` and `removeEventListener()` are very useful when writing interactive SVG. You can pass an object that implements the `handleEvent` interface as the second parameter to these methods.

```js
function myRect(x, y, w, h, message) {
  this.message = message;

  this.rect = document.createElementNS("http://www.w3.org/2000/svg", "rect");

### Inter-document scripting: referencing embedded SVG

When using SVG within HTML, Adobe's SVG Viewer 3.0 automatically includes a window property called `svgDocument` that points to the SVG document. This is not the case for Mozilla's native SVG implementation; therefore, using `window.svgDocument` does not work in Mozilla. Instead, you can use

```js
const svgDoc = document.embeds["name_of_svg"].getSVGDocument();
```

to get a reference to an embedded SVG document instead.

The best way to get access to the {{domxref("Document")}} representing an SVG document is to look at {{domxref("HTMLIFrameElement.contentDocument")}} (if the document is presented in an {{HTMLElement("iframe")}}) or {{domxref("HTMLObjectElement.contentDocument")}} (if the document is presented in an {{HTMLElement("object")}} element), like this:

```js
const svgDoc = document.getElementById("iframe_element").contentDocument;
```

In addition, the {{HTMLElement("iframe")}}, {{HTMLElement("embed")}}, and {{HTMLElement("object")}} elements offer a method, `getSVGDocument()`, which returns the {{domxref("XMLDocument")}} representing the element's embedded SVG or `null` if the element doesn't represent an SVG document.

You can also use `document.getElementById("svg_elem_name").getSVGDocument()`, which gives the same result.

> [!NOTE]
> You may find documentation referring to an `SVGDocument` interface. Prior to SVG 2, SVG documents were represented using that interface. However, SVG documents are now represented using the {{domxref("XMLDocument")}} interface instead.

### Inter-document scripting: calling JavaScript functions

When calling a JavaScript function that resides in the HTML file from an SVG file that is embedded in an HTML document, you should use `parent.functionName()` to reference the function. Although the Adobe SVG viewer plugin allows the use of `functionName()`, it's not the preferred way to do things.

> [!NOTE]
> According to the [SVG wiki](https://web.archive.org/web/20100223210744/http://wiki.svg.org/Inter-Document_Communication) the `"parent"` JS variable is broken in Adobe's SVG version 6 preview plugin. The suggested workaround is to use `"top"` instead of `"parent"`. Since it is a beta version of their plugin, we can probably safely ignore this.

More information and some examples can be found on the [SVG wiki inter-document scripting page](https://web.archive.org/web/20100223210744/http://wiki.svg.org/Inter-Document_Communication).

### `setProperty` has three parameters

The function `svgElement.style.setProperty("fill-opacity", "0.0")` throws a DOMException - `SYNTAX ERR` in Mozilla. This behavior is specified by the W3C in the DOM Level 2 Style Specification. The function `setProperty` is defined as a function with three parameters. The above can be replaced with `'svgElement.style.setProperty("fill-opacity", "0.0", "")'`, which is standards compliant.

# SVG animation with SMIL

[Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language](https://www.w3.org/TR/SMIL/) (SMIL) is an XML-based language for writing interactive multimedia presentations.
Authors can use SMIL syntax in other XML-based languages to define the timing and layout of elements for animation.

SMIL allows you to:

- animate the numeric attributes of an element ([x](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/x), [y](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/y), etc.)
- animate [transform](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/transform) attributes ([translation](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/transform#translate), [rotate](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/transform#rotate), etc.)
- animate [color](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/color) attributes
- follow a motion [path](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/path)

The following sections show how to use SMIL in [SVG](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) for these four use cases.

## Animating attributes of an element

The following example animates the [`cx` attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/cx) of a circle. To do so, we add an {{ SVGElement("animate") }} element inside the {{ SVGElement("circle") }} element. The important attributes for {{ SVGElement("animate") }} are:

- `attributeName`
  - : The name of the attribute to animate.
- `from`
  - : The initial value of the attribute.
- `to`
  - : The final value.
- `dur`
  - : The duration of the animation (for example, write '5s' for 5 seconds).

If you want to animate more attributes inside the same element, you can add more {{ SVGElement("animate") }} elements.

```html
<svg width="300" height="100">
  <title>Attribute Animation with SMIL</title>
  <rect x="0" y="0" width="300" height="100" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" />
  <circle cx="0" cy="50" r="15" fill="blue" stroke="black" stroke-width="1">
    <animate
      attributeName="cx"
      from="0"
      to="500"
      dur="5s"
      repeatCount="indefinite" />
  </circle>
</svg>
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Animating_attributes_of_an_element', '100%', 120) }}

## Animating the transform attributes

The {{ SVGElement("animateTransform") }} element let you animate [transform](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/transform) attributes. This element is necessary because we are not animating a single attribute like [x](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/x) which is a number. Rotation attributes look like this: `rotation(theta, x, y)`, where `theta` is the angle in degrees, and `x` and `y` are absolute positions. In the example below, we animate the center of the rotation and the angle.

```html
<svg width="300" height="100">
  <title>SVG SMIL Animate with transform</title>
  <rect x="0" y="0" width="300" height="100" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" />
  <rect
    x="0"
    y="50"
    width="15"
    height="34"
    fill="blue"
    stroke="black"
    stroke-width="1">
    <animateTransform
      attributeName="transform"
      begin="0s"
      dur="20s"
      type="rotate"
      from="0 60 60"
      to="360 100 60"
      repeatCount="indefinite" />
  </rect>
</svg>
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Animating_the_transform_attributes', '100%', 120) }}

## Animation following a path

The {{ SVGElement("animateMotion") }} element lets you animate an element position and rotation according to a path. The path is defined the same way as in {{ SVGElement("path") }}. You can set the attribute to define whether the object rotates following the tangent of the path.

### Example 1: Linear motion

In this example, a blue circle bounces between the left and right edges of a black box, over and over again, indefinitely. The animation here is handled by the {{ SVGElement("animateMotion") }} element. In this case, we're establishing a path consisting of a **MoveTo** command to define the starting point for the animation, then the **Horizontal-line** command to move the circle 300 pixels to the right, followed by the **Z command**, which closes the path, establishing a loop back to the beginning. By setting the value of the **repeatCount** attribute to `indefinite`, we indicate that the animation should loop forever, as long as the SVG image exists.

```html
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="300" height="100">
  <title>SVG SMIL Animate with Path</title>
  <rect x="0" y="0" width="300" height="100" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" />
  <circle cx="0" cy="50" r="15" fill="blue" stroke="black" stroke-width="1">
    <animateMotion path="M 0 0 H 300 Z" dur="3s" repeatCount="indefinite" />
  </circle>
</svg>
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Example_1_Linear_motion', '100%', 120) }}

[View live sample](https://mdn.dev/archives/media/samples/svg/svganimdemo1.html)

### Example 2: Curved motion

Same example as before with a curved path and following the direction of the path.

```html
<svg width="300" height="100">
  <title>SVG SMIL Animate with Path</title>
  <rect x="0" y="0" width="300" height="100" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" />
  <rect
    x="0"
    y="0"
    width="20"
    height="20"
    fill="blue"
    stroke="black"
    stroke-width="1">
    <animateMotion
      path="M 250,80 H 50 Q 30,80 30,50 Q 30,20 50,20 H 250 Q 280,20,280,50 Q 280,80,250,80Z"
      dur="3s"
      repeatCount="indefinite"
      rotate="auto" />
  </rect>
</svg>
```

# SVG as an image

SVG can be used as an image format in HTML, CSS, certain SVG elements, and via the Canvas API.
This page lists the features where you can provide SVG as an image source.

## Features supporting SVG

Browsers support SVG images in:

- HTML {{HTMLElement("img")}} or {{SVGElement("svg")}} elements
- CSS {{cssxref("background-image")}}
- CSS {{cssxref("list-style-image")}}
- CSS {{cssxref("content")}}
- SVG {{SVGElement("image")}} element
- SVG {{SVGElement("feImage")}} element
- Canvas [`drawImage`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Using_images#drawing_images) function

## Restrictions

For security purposes, some browsers place restrictions on SVG content when it's being used as an image.
Specifically, the following limitations may apply:

- [JavaScript](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) is disabled.
- External resources (e.g., images, stylesheets) cannot be loaded, though they can be used if inlined through [`data:` URLs](/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Schemes/data).
- {{cssxref(":visited")}}-link styles aren't rendered.
- Platform-native widget styling (based on OS theme) is disabled.

Note that the above restrictions are specific to image contexts; they don't apply when SVG content is viewed directly, or when it's embedded as a document via the {{HTMLElement("iframe")}}, {{HTMLElement("object")}}, or {{HTMLElement("embed")}} elements.

## Specifications

# SVG filters

SVG allows us to use similar tools as the bitmap description language such as the use of shadow, blur effects or even merging the results of different filters. With the filter element `<filter>` it is possible to add these effects and later on attach them to an object.

Filters act like layers. When creating them, try applying and testing the effect step by step.

This element has different attributes that help us create the clipping region. Between the filter tags, we can define the _primitives_ that allow us to implement the desired effect. One of these primitives is the [`<feGaussianBlur>`](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/feGaussianBlur). The keyword [`SourceAlpha`](https://drafts.fxtf.org/filter-effects/#attr-valuedef-in-sourcealpha) identifies the input for this primitive, is in this case input `in`. The amount of blur to be applied is done using the `stdDeviation` attribute.

## SVG filter example

```html
<defs>
  <filter id="drop-shadow">
    <feGaussianBlur in="SourceAlpha" stdDeviation="3" />
  </filter>
</defs>

<g id="ghost" filter="url(#drop-shadow)">
  <!--Ghost drawing in here-->
</g>
```

The above example will not produce the desired output. Instead we need to add more filter primitives which will produce the desired rendering. By adding `feoffset` and `result`, the effect layer is defined.

`<result>` attribute is a reference that can be used later. It is quite different to an XML id and only can be referenced within the actual `filter`. **`<feoffset>`** primitive has the blur result from the Gaussian blur. **`<feMerge>`** primitive contains the nodes **`<feMergeNode>`** taking as input the result offsetBlur, this will allow it to appear below the `sourceGraphic`.

## Implementation of more primitives

```html
<defs>
  <filter id="drop-shadow">
    <feGaussianBlur in="SourceAlpha" stdDeviation="3" result="blur" />
    <feoffset in="blur" dx="4" dy="4" result="offsetBlur" />
    <feMerge>
      <feMergeNode in="offsetBlur" />
      <feMergeNode in="SourceGraphic" />
    </feMerge>
  </filter>
</defs>
```
# SVG in HTML introduction

This article and its associated example shows how to use inline [SVG](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG).

## Basic example

To include an inline SVG in an HTML file, paste the entire SVG file into the HTML file.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>SVG Demo</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid slice" role="img">
      <title>A gradient</title>
      <linearGradient id="gradient">
        <stop class="begin" offset="0%" stop-color="red" />
        <stop class="end" offset="100%" stop-color="black" />
      </linearGradient>
      <rect x="0" y="0" width="100" height="100" fill="url(#gradient)" />
      <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="30" fill="url(#gradient)" />
    </svg>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Discussion

The page is regular HTML and CSS with a single SVG. The only interesting part is the `<svg>` element it contains. This element and its children are declared to be in the SVG namespace. The element contains a gradient and two shapes filled with the gradient. The gradient color stops have their colors set by CSS.

There are three attributes and one nested element worth noting:

1. The [`viewBox`](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/viewBox) attribute establishes a logical coordinate system which the SVG picture's coordinates are relative to. In this case our picture is laid out in a 100 by 100 viewport.

2. The [`preserveAspectRatio`](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/preserveAspectRatio) attribute specifies that the {{glossary("aspect ratio")}} must be preserved by centering the picture in the available size, sizing to the maximum of the height or width and then cutting off any overflow.

3. Including [`role="img"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/img_role) ensures assistive technologies handle the SVG as an image.

4. A [`<title>`](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/title) within an SVG provides the accessible, short-text description of the graphic. The title text is not rendered, but browsers may display it as a tooltip when the SVG is hovered. The `<title>` should be the first element after the `<svg>` opening tag.

## Best practices

When an SVG is included via an {{HTMLElement('img')}} element, the `alt` attribute provides alternative text making the image accessible. Inline SVG does not support the `alt` attribute. But it does support several other ways of making it accessible. With inline SVGs, the source is available in the DOM, meaning all the markup within an inline SVG file is accessible to the Accessibility Object Model, or AOM. Including the `<title>` element provides that alternative text.

If the image conveys more than a short title, include a longer description with the [`<desc>`](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/desc) element. The `<desc>` element provides an accessible, long-text description. Similar to `<title>` text, the text within the `<desc>` is not rendered to the screen.

If the SVG can be labeled by visible text, reference that text with an [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) attribute. Alternatively, include the `aria-labelledby` attribute with the [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/id) of the `<title>`.

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 100 125" role="img" aria-labelledby="svgTitle svgDescription">
  <title id="svgTitle">Manual</title>
  <desc id="svgDescription">
    A nondescript twelve page booklet opened to the middle page
  </desc>
  <defs>
    <style>
      rect {
        fill: #cccccc;
        stroke: #666666;
        transform-origin: top;
      }
    </style>
  </defs>

  <rect width="36" height="60" x="13" y="18" ry="2" transform="skewy(24deg)" />
  <rect width="39" height="60" x="11" y="20" ry="2" transform="skewY(18deg)" />
  <rect width="42" height="90" x="8" y="22" ry="2" transform="skewY(12deg)" />
  <rect width="36" height="60" x="50" y="18" ry="2" transform="skewY(-24deg)" />
  <rect width="39" height="60" x="50" y="20" ry="2" transform="skewY(-18deg)" />
  <rect width="42" height="90" x="50" y="22" ry="2" transform="skewY(-12deg)" />
</svg>
```

If the SVG can be described by visible text, that text can be referenced with the [`aria-describedby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-describedby) attribute. If aria-describedby is used, it will take precedence over `<desc>`.

In our example, we've included both the description and title in our `aria-labelledby` attribute, as it has better assistive technology support than `aria-describedby`.

# SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics

**Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)** is an [XML](/en-US/docs/Web/XML)-based markup language for describing two-dimensional based [vector graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics).

As such, it's a text-based, open Web standard for describing images that can be rendered cleanly at any size and are designed specifically to work well with other web standards including [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), [DOM](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model), [JavaScript](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), and [SMIL](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Guides/SVG_animation_with_SMIL). SVG is, essentially, to graphics what [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) is to text.

SVG images and their related behaviors are defined in [XML](/en-US/docs/Web/XML) text files, which means they can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed. Additionally, this means they can be created and edited with any text editor or with drawing software.

Compared to classic bitmapped image formats such as {{Glossary("JPEG")}} or {{Glossary("PNG")}}, SVG-format vector images can be rendered at any size without loss of quality and can be easily localized by updating the text within them, without the need of a graphical editor to do so. With proper libraries, SVG files can even be localized on-the-fly.

SVG has been developed by the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/) since 1999.

# accumulate

The **`accumulate`** attribute controls whether or not an animation is cumulative.

It is frequently useful for repeated animations to build upon the previous results, accumulating with each iteration. This attribute said to the animation if the value is added to the previous animated attribute's value on each iteration.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("animate")}}
- {{SVGElement("animateMotion")}}
- {{SVGElement("animateTransform")}}

## Usage notes

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td><code>none</code> | <code>sum</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Default value</th>
      <td><code>none</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Animatable</th>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

- `sum`
  - : Specifies that each repeat iteration after the first builds upon the last value of the previous iteration.
- `none`
  - : Specifies that repeat iterations are not cumulative.

This attribute is ignored if the target attribute value does not support addition, or if the animation element does not repeat.

This attribute will be ignored if the animation function is specified with only the {{SVGAttr("to")}} attribute.

## Specifications

- [SVG animation with SMIL](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Guides/SVG_animation_with_SMIL)
# additive

The **`additive`** attribute controls whether or not an animation is additive.

It is frequently useful to define animation as an offset or delta to an attribute's value, rather than as absolute values.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("animate")}}
- {{SVGElement("animateMotion")}}
- {{SVGElement("animateTransform")}}

## Usage notes

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td><code>replace</code> | <code>sum</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Default value</th>
      <td><code>replace</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Animatable</th>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

- sum
  - : Specifies that the animation will add to the underlying value of the attribute and other lower priority animations.
- replace
  - : Specifies that the animation will override the underlying value of the attribute and other lower priority animations. This is the default, however the behavior is also affected by the animation value attributes {{SVGAttr("by")}} and {{SVGAttr("to")}}, as described in [SMIL Animation: How from, to and by attributes affect additive behavior](https://www.w3.org/TR/smil-animation/#FromToByAndAdditive).

# alignment-baseline

The **`alignment-baseline`** attribute specifies how an object is aligned with respect to its parent. This property specifies which baseline of this element is to be aligned with the corresponding baseline of the parent. For example, this allows {{glossary("/Baseline/Typography", "alphabetic baselines")}} in Roman text to stay aligned across font size changes. It defaults to the baseline with the same name as the computed value of the `alignment-baseline` property.

> [!NOTE]
> As a presentation attribute, `alignment-baseline` also has a CSS property counterpart: {{cssxref("alignment-baseline")}}. When both are specified, the CSS property takes priority.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("tspan")}}
- {{SVGElement("text")}}
- {{SVGElement("textPath")}}

## Usage notes

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td>
        <code>auto</code> | <code>baseline</code> | <code>before-edge</code> |
        <code>text-before-edge</code> | <code>middle</code> |

- `ideographic`
  - : Matches the box's ideographic character face under-side baseline to that of its parent.
- `alphabetic`
  - : Matches the box's alphabetic baseline to that of its parent.
- `hanging`
  - : The alignment-point of the object being aligned is aligned with the "hanging" baseline of the parent text content element.
- `mathematical`
  - : Matches the box's mathematical baseline to that of its parent.
- `top`
  - : Aligns the top of the aligned subtree with the top of the line box.
- `center`
  - : Aligns the center of the aligned subtree with the center of the line box.
- `bottom`
  - : Aligns the bottom of the aligned subtree with the bottom of the line box.

SVG 2 introduces some changes to the definition of this property. In particular: the values `auto`, `before-edge`, and `after-edge` have been removed. For backwards compatibility, `text-before-edge` may be mapped to `text-top` and `text-after-edge` to `text-bottom`. Neither `text-before-edge` nor `text-after-edge` should be used with the {{cssxref("vertical-align")}} property.

The **`baseProfile`** attribute describes the minimum SVG language profile that the author believes is necessary to correctly render the content. The attribute does not specify any processing restrictions; It can be considered metadata.

For example, the value of the attribute could be used by an authoring tool to warn the user when they are modifying the document beyond the scope of the specified base profile.

Each SVG profile should define the text that is appropriate for this attribute.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

# begin

The **`begin`** attribute defines when the associated element becomes active.
For an animation element, this is the point at which the animation should begin.

The attribute value is a semicolon separated list of values. The interpretation of a list of start times is detailed in the SMIL specification in ["Evaluation of begin and end time lists"](https://www.w3.org/TR/smil-animation/#Timing-EvaluationOfBeginEndTimeLists). Each individual value can be one of the following: `<offset-value>`, `<syncbase-value>`, `<event-value>`, `<repeat-value>`, `<accessKey-value>`, `<wallclock-sync-value>` or the keyword `indefinite`.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("animate")}}
- {{SVGElement("animateMotion")}}
- {{SVGElement("animateTransform")}}
- {{SVGElement("set")}}

## animate, animateMotion, animateTransform, set

For {{SVGElement("animate")}}, {{SVGElement("animateMotion")}}, {{SVGElement("animateTransform")}}, and {{SVGElement("set")}}, `begin` defines when the element should begin, i.e., become active.

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td><code>&#x3C;begin-value-list></code></td>

      <th scope="row">Animatable</th>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The `<begin-value-list>` is a semicolon-separated list of values. Each value can be one of the following:

- `<offset-value>`
  - : This value defines a [clock-value](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Guides/Content_type#clock-value) that represents a point in time relative to the beginning of the SVG document (usually the {{domxref("Window/load_event", "load")}} or {{domxref("Document/DOMContentLoaded_event", "DOMContentLoaded")}} event). Negative values are valid.
- `<syncbase-value>`
  - : This value defines a _syncbase_ and an optional offset from that _syncbase_. The element's animation start time is defined relative to the begin or active end of another animation.

    A valid syncbase-value consists of an ID reference to another animation element followed by a dot and either `begin` or `end` to identify whether to synchronize with the beginning or active end of the referenced animation element. An optional offset value as defined in `<offset-value>` can be appended.

- `<event-value>`
  - : This value defines an event and an optional offset that determines the time at which the element's animation should begin. The animation start time is defined relative to the time that the specified event is fired.

    A valid event-value consists of an element ID followed by a dot and one of the supported events for that element. All valid events (not necessarily supported by all elements) are defined by the DOM and HTML specifications. Those are:
    - {{domxref("Element/focus_event", "focus")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/blur_event", "blur")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/focusin_event", "focusin")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/focusout_event", "focusout")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/DOMActivate_event", "DOMActivate")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/auxclick_event", "auxclick")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/click_event", "click")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/dblclick_event", "dblclick")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/mousedown_event", "mousedown")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/mouseenter_event", "mouseenter")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/mouseleave_event", "mouseleave")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/mousemove_event", "mousemove")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/mouseout_event", "mouseout")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/mouseover_event", "mouseover")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/mouseup_event", "mouseup")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/wheel_event","wheel")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/beforeinput_event", "beforeinput")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/input_event", "input")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/keydown_event", "keydown")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/keyup_event", "keyup")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/compositionstart_event", "compositionstart")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/compositionupdate_event", "compositionupdate")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/compositionend_event", "compositionend")}}
    - {{domxref("Window/load_event", "load")}}
    - {{domxref("Window/unload_event", "unload")}}
    - {{domxref("HTMLMediaElement/abort_event", "abort")}}
    - {{domxref("HTMLElement/error_event", "error")}}
    - {{domxref("HTMLInputElement/select_event", "select")}}
    - {{domxref("Window/resize_event", "resize")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/scroll_event", "scroll")}}
    - {{domxref("SVGAnimationElement/beginEvent_event", "beginEvent")}}
    - {{domxref("SVGAnimationElement/endEvent_event", "endEvent")}}
    - {{domxref("SVGAnimationElement/repeatEvent_event", "repeatEvent")}}

    An optional offset value as defined in `<offset-value>` can be appended.

- `<repeat-value>`
  - : This value defines a qualified repeat event. The element animation start time is defined relative to the time that the repeat event is raised with the specified iteration value.

    A valid repeat value consists of an element ID followed by a dot and the function `repeat()` with an integer value specifying the number of repetitions as parameter. An optional offset value as defined in `<offset-value>` can be appended.

- `<accessKey-value>`
  - : This value defines an access key that should trigger the animation. The element animation will begin when the user presses the specified key.

    A valid accessKey-value consists of the function `accessKey()` with the character to be input as parameter. An optional offset value as defined in `<offset-value>` can be appended.

- `<wallclock-sync-value>`
  - : This value defines the animation start time as a real-world clock time.

    A valid wallclock-sync-value consists of the function `wallclock()` with a time value as parameter. The time syntax is based upon the syntax defined in [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html).

- `indefinite`
  - : The begin of the animation will be determined by a `beginElement()` method call or a hyperlink targeted to the element.

# bias

The **`bias`** attribute shifts the range of the filter. After applying the {{SVGAttr("kernelMatrix")}} of the {{SVGElement("feConvolveMatrix")}} element to the input image to yield a number and applied the {{SVGAttr("divisor")}} attribute, the `bias` attribute is added to each component. This allows representation of values that would otherwise be clamped to 0 or 1.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("feConvolveMatrix")}}

## Usage notes

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td>
        <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Guides/Content_type#number">&#x3C;number></a>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Default value</th>
      <td><code>0</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Animatable</th>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

One application of bias is when it is desirable to have 0.5 gray value be the zero response of the filter.

## Specifications

## Browser compatibility

{{Compat}}
# by

The **`by`** attribute specifies a relative offset value for an attribute that will be modified during an animation.

The starting value for the attribute is either indicated by specifying it as value for the attribute given in the {{SVGAttr("attributeName")}} or the {{SVGAttr("from")}} attribute.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("animate")}}
- {{SVGElement("animateMotion")}}
- {{SVGElement("animateTransform")}}

## Example

```css hidden
html,
body,
svg {
  height: 100%;
}
```

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect x="10" y="10" width="100" height="100">
    <animate attributeName="width" fill="freeze" by="50" dur="3s" />
  </rect>
</svg>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Example", "200", "200")}}

## Usage notes

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td><em>See below</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Default value</th>
      <td><em>None</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Animatable</th>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The exact value type for this attribute depends on the value of the attribute that will be animated.

When a list of values is defined via the {{SVGAttr("values")}} attribute, the `by` attribute is ignored.

## Specifications

{{Specifications}}

## Browser compatibility

{{Compat}}
# calcMode

The **`calcMode`** attribute specifies the {{Glossary("interpolation")}} mode for the animation.

The default mode is `linear`, however if the attribute does not support linear interpolation (e.g., for strings), the `calcMode` attribute is ignored and discrete interpolation is used.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("animate")}}
- {{SVGElement("animateMotion")}}
- {{SVGElement("animateTransform")}}

## Usage notes

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td>
        <code>discrete</code> | <code>linear</code> | <code>paced</code> |
        <code>spline</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Default value</th>
      <td><code>linear</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Animatable</th>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

- `discrete`
  - : This specifies that the animation function will jump from one value to the next without any interpolation.
- `linear`
  - : Simple linear interpolation between values is used to calculate the animation function. Except for {{SVGElement("animateMotion")}}, this is the default value.
- `paced`
  - : Defines interpolation to produce an even pace of change across the animation. This is only supported for values that define a linear numeric range, and for which some notion of "distance" between points can be calculated (e.g., position, width, height, etc.). If paced is specified, any {{SVGAttr("keyTimes")}} or {{SVGAttr("keySplines")}} will be ignored. For {{SVGElement("animateMotion")}}, this is the default value.
- `spline`
  - : Interpolates from one value in the {{SVGAttr("values")}} list to the next according to a time function defined by a cubic Bézier spline. The points of the spline are defined in the {{SVGAttr("keyTimes")}} attribute, and the control points for each interval are defined in the {{SVGAttr("keySplines")}} attribute.

# class

Assigns a class name or set of class names to an element. You may assign the same class name or names to any number of elements, however, multiple class names must be separated by whitespace characters.

An element's class name serves two key roles:

- As a style sheet selector, for when an author assigns style information to a set of elements.
- For general use by the browser.

You can use this class to style SVG content using CSS.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement('a')}}
- {{SVGElement('circle')}}
- {{SVGElement('clipPath')}}
- {{SVGElement('ellipse')}}
- {{SVGElement('g')}}
- {{SVGElement('image')}}
- {{SVGElement('line')}}

- {{SVGElement('mask')}}
- {{SVGElement('path')}}
- {{SVGElement('pattern')}}
- {{SVGElement('polygon')}}
- {{SVGElement('polyline')}}
- {{SVGElement('rect')}}
- {{SVGElement('svg')}}
- {{SVGElement('symbol')}}

# clip-rule

The `clip-rule` attribute only applies to graphics elements that are contained within a {{ SVGElement("clipPath") }} element. The `clip-rule` attribute basically works as the {{ SVGAttr("fill-rule") }} attribute, except that it applies to {{ SVGElement("clipPath") }} definitions.

> [!NOTE]
> As a presentation attribute, `clip-rule` also has a CSS property counterpart: {{cssxref("clip-rule")}}. When both are specified, the CSS property takes priority.

The following fragment of code will cause an evenodd clipping rule to be applied to the clipping path because `clip-rule` is specified on the {{ SVGElement("path") }} element that defines the clipping shape:

```html
<g>
  <clipPath id="MyClip">
    <path d="..." clip-rule="evenodd" />
  </clipPath>
  <rect clip-path="url(#MyClip)" ... />
</g>
```

whereas the following fragment of code will not cause an evenodd clipping rule to be applied because the `clip-rule` is specified on the referencing element, not on the object defining the clipping shape:

```html
<g>
  <clipPath id="MyClip">
    <path d="..." />
  </clipPath>
  <rect clip-path="url(#MyClip)" clip-rule="evenodd" ... />
</g>
```

The **`clip`** attribute defines the visible region of an element. You should use {{svgattr("clip-path")}} instead.

> [!NOTE]
> As a presentation attribute, `clip` also has a CSS property counterpart: {{cssxref("clip")}}. When both are specified, the CSS property takes priority.

This attribute has the same parameter values as defined for the CSS {{cssxref("clip")}} property. Unitless values, which indicate current user coordinates, are permitted on the coordinate values on the `rect()`. The value of `auto` defines a clipping path along the bounds of the viewport created by the given element.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{ SVGElement("svg") }}
- {{ SVGElement("symbol") }}
- {{ SVGElement("image") }}
- {{ SVGElement("foreignObject") }}
- {{ SVGElement("pattern") }}
- {{ SVGElement("marker") }}

## Example

```css hidden
html,
body,
svg {
  height: 100%;
}
```

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 20 10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <!-- Auto clipping -->
  <svg x="0" width="10" height="10" clip="auto">
    <circle cx="5" cy="5" r="4" stroke="green" />
  </svg>

  <!-- Rect(top, right, bottom, left) clipping -->
  <svg x="10" width="10" height="10" clip="rect(1, 9, 8, 2)">
    <circle cx="5" cy="5" r="4" stroke="green" />
  </svg>

The value `auto` defines a clipping path along the bounds of the viewport created by the given element. The value `rect()` defines a clipping rectangle following the following syntax: `rect(<top>, <right>, <bottom>, <left>)`. The `<top>` and `<bottom>` values specify offsets from the _top border edge_ of the element viewport, while `<right>` and `<left>` specify offsets from the _left border edge_ of the element viewport.

# color-interpolation-filters

The **`color-interpolation-filters`** attribute specifies the color space for imaging operations performed via filter effects.

> [!NOTE]
> This property just has an affect on filter operations. Therefore, it has no effect on filter primitives like {{SVGElement("feOffset")}}, {{SVGElement("feImage")}}, {{SVGElement("feTile")}} or {{SVGElement("feFlood")}}.
>
> `color-interpolation-filters` has a different initial value than {{SVGAttr("color-interpolation")}}. `color-interpolation-filters` has an initial value of `linearRGB`, whereas `color-interpolation` has an initial value of `sRGB`. Thus, in the default case, filter effects operations occur in the linearRGB color space, whereas all other color interpolations occur by default in the sRGB color space.
>
> It has no affect on filter functions, which operate in the {{Glossary("RGB", "sRGB")}} color space.

> [!NOTE]
> As a presentation attribute, `color-interpolation-filters` also has a CSS property counterpart: {{cssxref("color-interpolation-filters")}}. When both are specified, the CSS property takes priority.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("feSpotLight")}}
- {{SVGElement("feBlend")}}
- {{SVGElement("feColorMatrix")}}

# color-interpolation

The **`color-interpolation`** attribute specifies the color space for gradient interpolations, color animations, and alpha compositing.

> [!NOTE]
> For filter effects, the {{SVGAttr("color-interpolation-filters")}} property controls which color space is used.

The `color-interpolation` property chooses between color operations occurring in the sRGB color space or in a (light energy linear) linearized RGB color space. Having chosen the appropriate color space, component-wise linear interpolation is used.

When a child element is blended into a background, the value of the `color-interpolation` property on the child determines the type of blending, not the value of the `color-interpolation` on the parent. For gradients which make use of the {{SVGAttr("href")}} or the deprecated {{SVGAttr("xlink:href")}} attribute to reference another gradient, the gradient uses the property's value from the gradient element which is directly referenced by the {{SVGAttr("fill")}} or {{SVGAttr("stroke")}} property. When animating colors, color interpolation is performed according to the value of the `color-interpolation` property on the element being animated.

> [!NOTE]
> As a presentation attribute, `color-interpolation` also has a CSS property counterpart: {{cssxref("color-interpolation")}}. When both are specified, the CSS property takes priority.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("a")}}
- {{SVGElement("animate")}}
- {{SVGElement("circle")}}
- {{SVGElement("clipPath")}}
- {{SVGElement("defs")}}
- {{SVGElement("ellipse")}}

## Example

This example shows four SVGs, each with a {{SVGElement("rect")}} element and a different gradient used as a fill for the `<rect>`. The first two SVGs use {{SVGElement("linearGradient")}} and the second two use {{SVGElement("radialGradient")}} elements. In unsupported browsers, the gradient looks the same.

In this first SVG, the `color-interpolation` attribute is not included on the `<linearGradient>` element, which defaults to `sRGB`.

```css hidden
svg {
  display: block;
}
```

```html
<svg width="450" height="70">

  </title>

    <linearGradient id="gradientDefault">

      <stop offset="25%" stop-color="blue" />
      <stop offset="50%" stop-color="white" />
      <stop offset="75%" stop-color="red" />
      <stop offset="100%" stop-color="white" />
    </linearGradient>
  </defs>
  <rect
    x="0"
    y="0"
    width="400"
    height="40"
    fill="url(#gradientDefault)"
    stroke="black" />
  <text x="0" y="60" font-family="courier" font-size="16">
    color-interpolation not set
  </text>
</svg>
```

In this second SVG, the `color-interpolation` attribute is included on the `<linearGradient>` element and set to `linearRGB`.

```html
<svg width="450" height="70">
  <title>
    Example of linearGradient using the color-interpolation attribute
  </title>
  <defs>
    <linearGradient id="gradientLinearRGB" color-interpolation="linearRGB">
      <stop offset="0%" stop-color="white" />
      <stop offset="25%" stop-color="blue" />
      <stop offset="50%" stop-color="white" />
      <stop offset="75%" stop-color="red" />
      <stop offset="100%" stop-color="white" />
    </linearGradient>
  </defs>
  <rect
    x="0"
    y="0"
    width="400"
    height="40"
    fill="url(#gradientLinearRGB)"
    stroke="black" />
  <text x="0" y="60" font-family="courier" font-size="16">
    color-interpolation="linearRGB"
  </text>
</svg>
```

In this third SVG, the `color-interpolation` attribute is not included on the `<radialGradient>` element, which defaults to `sRGB`.

```html
<svg width="450" height="70">
  <title>
    Example of radialGradient excluding the color-interpolation attribute
  </title>
  <defs>
    <radialGradient id="none">
      <stop offset="0%" stop-color="red" />
      <stop offset="100%" stop-color="gold" />
    </radialGradient>
  </defs>
  <rect x="0" y="0" width="400" height="40" fill="url(#none)" stroke="black" />
  <text x="0" y="60" font-family="courier" font-size="16">
    color-interpolation not set
  </text>
</svg>
```

In this fourth SVG, the `color-interpolation` attribute is included on the `<radialGradient>` element and set to `linearRGB`.

```html
<svg width="450" height="70">
  <title>
    Example of radialGradient using the color-interpolation attribute
  </title>

      <stop offset="100%" stop-color="gold" />
    </radialGradient>
  </defs>
  <rect
    x="0"

    width="400"
    height="40"
    fill="url(#radLinearRGB)"
    stroke="black" />
  <text x="0" y="60" font-family="courier" font-size="16">

# color

The **`color`** attribute is used to provide a potential indirect value, `currentColor`, for the {{SVGAttr("fill")}}, {{SVGAttr("stroke")}}, {{SVGAttr("stop-color")}}, {{SVGAttr("flood-color")}}, and {{SVGAttr("lighting-color")}} attributes.

> [!NOTE]
> As a presentation attribute, `color` also has a CSS property counterpart: {{cssxref("color")}}. When both are specified, the CSS property takes priority.

Technically, `color` can be applied to any element, but it has no direct effect on SVG elements.

| `use-credentials` | Client CORS requests for this element will have the credentials flag set to 'include'.                            |
| `""`              | Setting the attribute name to an empty value, like `crossorigin` or `crossorigin=""`, is the same as `anonymous`. |

# cy

The **`cy`** attribute defines the y-axis coordinate of a center point.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("circle")}}
- {{SVGElement("ellipse")}}
- {{SVGElement("radialGradient")}}

> [!NOTE]
> As a _geometry property_, {{cssxref("cy")}} can also be used as CSS property for `<circle>` and `<ellipse>`.

## Example

```css hidden
html,
body,
svg {
  height: 100%;
}
```

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 100 300" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <radialGradient cy="25%" id="myGradient">
    <stop offset="0" stop-color="white" />
    <stop offset="100%" stop-color="black" />
  </radialGradient>

  <circle cy="50" cx="50" r="45" />
  <ellipse cy="150" cx="50" rx="45" ry="25" />
  <rect x="5" y="205" width="90" height="90" fill="url(#myGradient)" />
</svg>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Example", '100%', 300)}}

## circle

For {{SVGElement('circle')}}, `cy` defines the y-axis coordinate of the center of the shape.

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td>{{cssxref("length-percentage")}}</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Animatable</th>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

> [!NOTE]
> The y-axis coordinate of the center of the `<circle>` can also be defined with the {{cssxref("cy")}} _geometry property_. If set in CSS, the `cy` property value overrides the `cy` attribute value.

## ellipse

For {{SVGElement('ellipse')}}, `cy` defines the y-axis coordinate of the center of the shape.

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td>{{cssxref("length-percentage")}}</td>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

> [!NOTE]
> The y-axis coordinate of the center of the `<ellipse>` can also be defined with the {{cssxref("cy")}} _geometry property_. If set in CSS, the `cy` property value overrides the `cy` attribute value.

## radialGradient

For {{SVGElement('radialGradient')}}, `cy` defines the y-axis coordinate of the end circle for the radial gradient.

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td>
        <strong><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Guides/Content_type#length">&#x3C;length></a></strong>

# d

The **`d`** attribute defines a path to be drawn.

A path definition is a list of [path commands](#path_commands) where each command is composed of a command letter and numbers that represent the command parameters.
The commands are [detailed below](#path_commands).

This attribute is used with the SVG [`<path>`](#path) element.

`d` is a presentation attribute, and hence can also be [used as a CSS property](#using_d_as_a_css_property).

## Example

```css hidden
html,
body,
svg {
  height: 100%;
}
```

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path
    fill="none"
    stroke="red"
    d="M 10,30
       A 20,20 0,0,1 50,30
       A 20,20 0,0,1 90,30
       Q 90,60 50,90
       Q 10,60 10,30 z" />
</svg>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Example', '100%', 200)}}

## path

For {{SVGElement('path')}}, `d` is a string containing a series of path commands that define the path to be drawn.

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td>
        <strong><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/string">&#x3C;string></a></strong>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Default value</th>
      <td><em>none</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Animatable</th>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Using d as a CSS property

`d` is a presentation attribute, and hence can be also be modified using CSS.
The property takes either [`path()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/basic-shape/path) or `none`.

The example below shows how you might apply a new path on hover over an element.
The new path is the same as the old one, but adds a line across the heart.

```css
html,
body,
svg {
  height: 100%;
}

/* This path is displayed on hover */
#svg_css_ex1:hover path {
  d: path(
    "M10,30 A20,20 0,0,1 50,30 A20,20 0,0,1 90,30 Q90,60 50,90 Q10,60 10,30 z M5,5 L90,90"
  );
}
```

```html
<svg id="svg_css_ex1" viewBox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path
    fill="none"
    stroke="red"
    d="M 10,30
       A 20,20 0,0,1 50,30
       A 20,20 0,0,1 90,30
       Q 90,60 50,90
       Q 10,60 10,30 z
       " />
</svg>
```

For a `<path>` animation example, see the CSS {{cssxref("d")}} property reference page example.

## Path commands

Path commands are instructions that define a path to be drawn. Each command is composed of a command letter and numbers that represent the command parameters.

SVG defines 6 types of path commands, for a total of 20 commands:

- [MoveTo](#moveto_path_commands): `M`, `m`
- [LineTo](#lineto_path_commands): `L`, `l`, `H`, `h`, `V`, `v`
- [Cubic Bézier curve](#cubic_bézier_curve): `C`, `c`, `S`, `s`
- [Quadratic Bézier curve](#quadratic_bézier_curve): `Q`, `q`, `T`, `t`
- [Elliptical arc curve](#elliptical_arc_curve): `A`, `a`
- [ClosePath](#closepath): `Z`, `z`

> [!NOTE]
> Commands are _case-sensitive_. An upper-case command specifies absolute coordinates, while a lower-case command specifies coordinates relative to the current position.

It is always possible to specify a negative value as an argument to a command:

- negative angles will be anti-clockwise;
- _absolute_ negative _x_ and _y_ values are interpreted as negative coordinates;
- _relative_ negative _x_ values move to the left, and relative negative _y_ values move upwards.

### MoveTo path commands

_MoveTo_ instructions can be thought of as picking up the drawing instrument, and setting it down somewhere else—in other words, moving the _current point_ (_P<sub>o</sub>_; {_x<sub>o</sub>_, _y<sub>o</sub>_}). There is no line drawn between _P<sub>o</sub>_ and the new _current point_ (_P<sub>n</sub>_; {_x<sub>n</sub>_, _y<sub>n</sub>_}).

### LineTo path commands

_LineTo_ instructions draw a straight line from the _current point_ (_P<sub>o</sub>_; {_x<sub>o</sub>_, _y<sub>o</sub>_}) to the _end point_ (_P<sub>n</sub>_; {_x<sub>n</sub>_, _y<sub>n</sub>_}), based on the parameters specified. The _end point_ (_P<sub>n</sub>_) then becomes the _current point_ for the next command (_P<sub>o</sub>′_).

### Cubic Bézier curve

_Cubic [Bézier curves](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Bezier_curve)_ are smooth curve definitions using four points:

- starting point (current point)
  - : (_P<sub>o</sub>_ = {_x<sub>o</sub>_, _y<sub>o</sub>_})
- end point
  - : (_P<sub>n</sub>_ = {_x<sub>n</sub>_, _y<sub>n</sub>_})
- start control point
  - : (_P<sub>cs</sub>_ = {_x<sub>cs</sub>_, _y<sub>cs</sub>_})
    (controls curvature near the start of the curve)
- end control point
  - : (_P<sub>ce</sub>_ = {_x<sub>ce</sub>_, _y<sub>ce</sub>_})
    (controls curvature near the end of the curve)

After drawing, the _end point_ (_P<sub>n</sub>_) becomes the _current point_ for the next command (_P<sub>o</sub>′_).

### Quadratic Bézier curve

_Quadratic [Bézier curves](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Bezier_curve)_ are smooth curve definitions using three points:

- starting point (current point)
  - : _P<sub>o</sub>_ = {_x<sub>o</sub>_, _y<sub>o</sub>_}
- end point
  - : _P<sub>n</sub>_ = {_x<sub>n</sub>_, _y<sub>n</sub>_}
- control point
  - : _P<sub>c</sub>_ = {_x<sub>c</sub>_, _y<sub>c</sub>_}
    (controls curvature)

After drawing, the _end point_ (_P<sub>n</sub>_) becomes the _current point_ for the next command (_P<sub>o</sub>′_).

### Elliptical arc curve

_Elliptical arc curves_ are curves defined as a portion of an ellipse. It is sometimes easier to draw highly regular curves with an elliptical arc than with a Bézier curve.

# data-*

The **`data-*`** SVG attributes are called custom data attributes. They let SVG markup and its resulting DOM share information that standard attributes can't, usually for scripting purposes. Their custom data are available via the {{domxref("SVGElement")}} interface of the element the attributes belong to, with the {{domxref("SVGElement.dataset")}} property.

The `*` can be replaced by any characters allowed in [XML's rules for names](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#NT-Name), with the following restrictions:

- Can't start with `xml`.
- No semicolons (`;`, `U+003A`).
- No capital `A` to `Z` letters.

> [!NOTE]
> The {{domxref("SVGElement.dataset")}} property is a {{domxref("DOMStringMap")}} that provides the attribute `data-test-value` via `SVGElement.dataset.testValue`. Hyphen characters (`-`, `U+002D`) are removed and the next letter is capitalized, resulting in the {{Glossary("camel_case", "camel case")}} format.

You can use this attribute with any SVG element.

# decoding

The `decoding` attribute, valid on {{SVGElement("image")}} elements, provides a hint to the browser as to whether it should perform image decoding along with rendering other content in a single presentation step that looks more "correct" (`sync`), or render and present the other content first and then decode the image and present it later (`async`). In practice, `async` means that the next paint does not wait for the image to decode.

It is often difficult to perceive any noticeable effect when using `decoding` on static `<image>` elements. They'll likely be initially rendered as empty images while the image files are fetched (either from the network or from the cache) and then handled independently anyway, so the "syncing" of content updates is less apparent. However, the blocking of rendering while decoding happens, while often quite small, _can_ be measured — even if it is difficult to observe with the human eye.

Using different `decoding` types can result in more noticeable differences when dynamically inserting `<image>` elements into the DOM via JavaScript — see {{domxref("SVGImageElement.decoding")}} for more details.

Allowed values:

- `sync`
  - : Decode the image synchronously along with rendering the other content, and present everything together.
- `async`
  - : Decode the image asynchronously, after rendering and presenting the other content.
- `auto`
  - : No preference for the decoding mode; the browser decides what is best for the user. This is the default value.

## Example

```html
<svg width="200" height="200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <image
    href="https://example.com/mdn_logo_dark.png"

# diffuseConstant

The **`diffuseConstant`** attribute represents the k<sub>d</sub> value in the [Phong lighting model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_reflection_model). In SVG, this can be any non-negative number.

It's used to determine the final RGB value of a given pixel. The brighter the lighting-color, the smaller this number should be.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("feDiffuseLighting")}}

# direction

The **`direction`** attribute specifies the inline-base direction of a {{SVGElement("text")}} or {{SVGElement("tspan")}} element. It defines the start and end points of a line of text as used by the {{SVGAttr("text-anchor")}} and {{cssxref("inline-size")}} properties. It also may affect the direction in which characters are positioned if the {{SVGAttr("unicode-bidi")}} property's value is either `embed` or `bidi-override`.

It applies only to glyphs oriented perpendicular to the inline-base direction, which includes the usual case of horizontally-oriented Latin or Arabic text and the case of narrow-cell Latin or Arabic characters rotated 90 degrees clockwise relative to a top-to-bottom inline-base direction.

In many cases, the bidirectional Unicode algorithm produces the desired result automatically, so this attribute doesn't need to be specified in those cases. For other cases, such as when using right-to-left languages, it may be sufficient to add the `direction` attribute to the outermost {{SVGElement("svg")}} element, and allow that direction to inherit to all text elements:

> [!NOTE]
> As a presentation attribute, `direction` also has a CSS property counterpart: {{cssxref("direction")}}. When both are specified, the CSS property takes priority.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("textPath")}}

- {{SVGElement("tspan")}}

# display

The **`display`** attribute lets you control the rendering of graphical or container elements.

A value of `display="none"` indicates that the given element and its children will not be rendered. Any value other than `none` or `inherit` indicates that the given element will be rendered by the browser.

When applied to a container element, setting `display` to `none` causes the container and all of its children to be invisible; thus, it acts on groups of elements as a group. This means that any child of an element with `display="none"` will never be rendered even if the child has a value for `display` other than `none`.

When the `display` attribute is set to `none`, then the given element does not become part of the rendering tree. It has implications for the {{SVGElement("tspan")}} elements, event processing, for bounding box calculations and for calculation of clipping paths:

- If `display` is set to `none` on a {{SVGElement("tspan")}} element, then the text string is ignored for the purposes of text layout.
- Regarding events, if `display` is set to `none`, the element receives no events.
- The geometry of a [graphics element](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element#graphics_elements) with `display` set to `none` is not included in bounding box and clipping paths calculations.

The `display` attribute only affects the direct rendering of a given element, whereas it does not prevent elements from being referenced by other elements. For example, setting it to `none` on a {{SVGElement("path")}} element will prevent that element from getting rendered directly onto the canvas, but the {{SVGElement("path")}} element can still be referenced by a {{SVGElement("textPath")}} element; furthermore, its geometry will be used in text-on-a-path processing even if the {{SVGElement("path")}} has a `display` value of `none`.

This attribute also affects direct rendering into offscreen canvases, such as occurs with masks or clip paths. Thus, setting `display="none"` on a child of a {{SVGElement("mask")}} will prevent the given child element from being rendered as part of the mask. Similarly, setting `display="none"` on a child of a {{SVGElement("clipPath")}} element will prevent the given child element from contributing to the clipping path.

> [!NOTE]
> As a presentation attribute, `display` also has a CSS property counterpart: {{cssxref("display")}}. When both are specified, the CSS property takes priority.

You can use this attribute with any SVG element.

# dominant-baseline

The **`dominant-baseline`** attribute specifies the dominant baseline, which is the baseline used to align the box's text and inline-level contents. It also indicates the default alignment baseline of any boxes participating in baseline alignment in the box's alignment context.

It is used to determine or re-determine a scaled-baseline-table. A scaled-baseline-table is a compound value with three components:

1. a baseline-identifier for the dominant-baseline,
2. a baseline-table, and
3. a baseline-table font-size.

Some values of the property re-determine all three values. Others only re-establish the baseline-table font-size. When the initial value, `auto`, would give an undesired result, this property can be used to explicitly set the desired scaled-baseline-table.

If there is no baseline table in the nominal font, or if the baseline table lacks an entry for the desired baseline, then the browser may use heuristics to determine the position of the desired baseline.

> [!NOTE]
> As a presentation attribute, `dominant-baseline` also has a CSS property counterpart: {{cssxref("dominant-baseline")}}. When both are specified, the CSS property takes priority.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("tspan")}}

- `auto`
  - : If this property occurs on a {{SVGElement("text")}} element, then the computed value depends on the value of the {{SVGAttr("writing-mode")}} attribute.

    If the {{SVGAttr("writing-mode")}} is horizontal, then the value of the dominant-baseline component is `alphabetic`. Otherwise, if the {{SVGAttr("writing-mode")}} is vertical, then the value of the dominant-baseline component is `central`.

    If this property occurs on a {{SVGElement("tspan")}} or {{SVGElement("textPath")}} element, then the dominant-baseline and the baseline-table components remain the same as those of the parent text content element.

    If the computed {{SVGAttr("baseline-shift")}} value actually shifts the baseline, then the baseline-table font-size component is set to the value of the {{SVGAttr("font-size")}} attribute on the element on which the `dominant-baseline` attribute occurs, otherwise the baseline-table font-size remains the same as that of the element.

    If there is no parent text content element, the scaled-baseline-table value is constructed as above for {{SVGElement("text")}} elements.

- `use-script` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : The dominant-baseline and the baseline-table components are set by determining the predominant script of the character data content. The {{SVGAttr("writing-mode")}}, whether horizontal or vertical, is used to select the appropriate set of baseline-tables and the dominant baseline is used to select the baseline-table that corresponds to that baseline. The baseline-table font-size component is set to the value of the {{SVGAttr("font-size")}} attribute on the element on which the `dominant-baseline` attribute occurs.
- `no-change` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : The dominant-baseline, the baseline-table, and the baseline-table font-size remain the same as that of the parent text content element.
- `reset-size` {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : The dominant-baseline and the baseline-table remain the same, but the baseline-table font-size is changed to the value of the {{SVGAttr("font-size")}} attribute on this element. This re-scales the baseline-table for the current {{SVGAttr("font-size")}}.
- `ideographic`
  - : The baseline-identifier for the dominant-baseline is set to be `ideographic`, the derived baseline-table is constructed using the `ideographic` baseline-table in the font, and the baseline-table font-size is changed to the value of the {{SVGAttr("font-size")}} attribute on this element.
- `alphabetic`
  - : The baseline-identifier for the dominant-baseline is set to be `alphabetic`, the derived baseline-table is constructed using the `alphabetic` baseline-table in the font, and the baseline-table font-size is changed to the value of the {{SVGAttr("font-size")}} attribute on this element.
- `hanging`
  - : The baseline-identifier for the dominant-baseline is set to be `hanging`, the derived baseline-table is constructed using the `hanging` baseline-table in the font, and the baseline-table font-size is changed to the value of the {{SVGAttr("font-size")}} attribute on this element.
- `mathematical`
  - : The baseline-identifier for the dominant-baseline is set to be `mathematical`, the derived baseline-table is constructed using the `mathematical` baseline-table in the font, and the baseline-table font-size is changed to the value of the {{SVGAttr("font-size")}} attribute on this element.
- `central`
  - : The baseline-identifier for the dominant-baseline is set to be `central`. The derived baseline-table is constructed from the defined baselines in a baseline-table in the font. That font baseline-table is chosen using the following priority order of baseline-table names: `ideographic`, `alphabetic`, `hanging`, `mathematical`. The baseline-table font-size is changed to the value of the {{SVGAttr("font-size")}} attribute on this element.
- `middle`

That font baseline-table is chosen using the following priority order of baseline-table names: `alphabetic`, `ideographic`, `hanging`, `mathematical`. The baseline-table font-size is changed to the value of the {{SVGAttr("font-size")}} attribute on this element.
- `text-after-edge`
  - : The baseline-identifier for the dominant-baseline is set to be `text-after-edge`. The derived baseline-table is constructed from the defined baselines in a baseline-table in the font. The choice of which font baseline-table to use from the baseline-tables in the font is browser dependent. The baseline-table font-size is changed to the value of the {{SVGAttr("font-size")}} attribute on this element.
- `text-before-edge`
  - : The baseline-identifier for the dominant-baseline is set to be `text-before-edge`. The derived baseline-table is constructed from the defined baselines in a baseline-table in the font.

- `<clock-value>`
  - : This value specifies the length of the simple duration. The value must be greater than 0 and can be expressed with hours (`h`), minutes (`m`), seconds (`s`) or milliseconds (`ms`). It's possible to combine those time representations to create some complex durations like `hh:mm:ss.iii` or `mm:ss.iii`.
- `media`
  - : This value specifies the simple duration as the intrinsic media duration. This is only valid for elements that define media.
    (For [animation elements](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element#animation_elements) the attribute will be ignored if `media` is specified.)
- `indefinite`
  - : This value specifies the simple duration as indefinite.

> [!NOTE]
> The {{Glossary("interpolation")}} will not work if the simple duration is indefinite (although this may still be useful for {{SVGElement("set")}} elements).

  - : This value defines a [clock-value](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Guides/Content_type#clock-value) that represents a point in time relative to the beginning of the SVG document (usually the {{domxref("SVGElement/load_event", "load")}} or {{domxref("Document/DOMContentLoaded_event", "DOMContentLoaded")}} event). Negative values are valid.
- `<syncbase-value>`
  - : This value defines a _syncbase_ and an optional offset from that _syncbase_. The element's animation end time is defined relative to the begin or active end of another animation.

    A valid syncbase-value consists of an ID reference to another animation element followed by a dot and either `begin` or `end` to identify whether to synchronize with the beginning or active end of the referenced animation element. An optional offset value as defined in `<offset-value>` can be appended.

- `<event-value>`
  - : This value defines an event and an optional offset that determines the time at which the element's animation should end. The animation end time is defined relative to the time that the specified event is fired.

    A valid event-value consists of an element ID followed by a dot and one of the supported events for that element. All valid events (not necessarily supported by all elements) are defined by the DOM and HTML specifications. Those are:
    - {{domxref("Element/focus_event", "focus")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/blur_event", "blur")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/focusin_event", "focusin")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/focusout_event", "focusout")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/DOMActivate_event", "activate")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/auxclick_event", "auxclick")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/click_event", "click")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/dblclick_event", "dblclick")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/mousedown_event", "mousedown")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/mouseenter_event", "mouseenter")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/mouseleave_event", "mouseleave")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/mousemove_event", "mousemove")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/mouseout_event", "mouseout")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/mouseover_event", "mouseover")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/mouseup_event", "mouseup")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/wheel_event", "wheel")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/beforeinput_event", "beforeinput")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/input_event", "input")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/keydown_event", "keydown")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/keyup_event", "keyup")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/compositionstart_event", "compositionstart")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/compositionupdate_event", "compositionupdate")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/compositionend_event", "compositionend")}}
    - {{domxref("SVGElement/load_event", "load")}}
    - {{domxref("SVGElement/unload_event", "unload")}}
    - {{domxref("SVGElement/abort_event", "abort")}}
    - {{domxref("HTMLElement/error_event", "error")}}
    - {{domxref("HTMLInputElement/select_event", "select")}}
    - {{domxref("Window/resize_event", "resize")}}
    - {{domxref("Element/scroll_event", "scroll")}}
    - {{domxref("SVGAnimationElement/beginEvent_event", "beginEvent")}}
    - {{domxref("SVGAnimationElement/endEvent_event", "endEvent")}}
    - {{domxref("SVGAnimationElement/repeatEvent_event", "repeatEvent")}}

    An optional offset value as defined in `<offset-value>` can be appended.

- `<repeat-value>`
  - : This value defines a qualified repeat event. The element animation end time is defined relative to the time that the repeat event is raised with the specified iteration value.

    A valid repeat value consists of an element ID followed by a dot and the function `repeat()` with an integer value specifying the number of repetitions as parameter. An optional offset value as defined in `<offset-value>` can be appended.

- `<accessKey-value>`
  - : This value defines an access key that should trigger the end of the animation. The element animation will end when the user presses the specified key.

    A valid accessKey-value consists of the function `accessKey()` with the character to be input as parameter. An optional offset value as defined in `<offset-value>` can be appended.

- `<wallclock-sync-value>`
  - : This value defines the animation end time as a real-world clock time.

    A valid wallclock-sync-value consists of the function `wallclock()` with a time value as parameter. The time syntax is based upon the syntax defined in [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html).

- `indefinite`
  - : The end of the animation will be determined by an {{domxref("SVGAnimationElement.endElement()")}} method call.

# fetchpriority

{{SeeCompatTable}}{{non-standard_header}}

The `fetchpriority` attribute provides a hint to the browser about the relative priority to use when fetching an external resource. This works the same way as the `fetchpriority` attribute for the HTML {{HTMLElement("img", "", "#fetchpriority")}} and {{HTMLElement("script", "", "#fetchpriority")}} elements.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGelement("feimage")}}
- {{SVGelement("image")}}
- {{SVGelement("script")}}

## Usage notes

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td><code>high</code> | <code>low</code> | <code>auto</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Default value</th>
      <td><code>auto</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

- `high`
  - : Fetches the external resource at a high priority relative to other external resources.
- `low`
  - : Fetches the external resource at a low priority relative to other external resources.
- `auto`
  - : Doesn't set a preference for the fetch priority.
    It is used if no value or an invalid value is set.
    This is the default.

## Examples

This example shows how to set an SVG {{SVGelement("script")}} element priority to `high`.

```html
<svg
  viewBox="0 0 10 10"
  height="120px"
  width="120px"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <circle id="normal" cx="5" cy="5" r="4" />
  <script href="./color-change.js" fetchpriority="high"></script>

# fill-opacity

The **`fill-opacity`** attribute is a presentation attribute defining the opacity of the paint server (_color_, _gradient_, _pattern_, etc.) applied to a shape.

> [!NOTE]
> As a presentation attribute, `fill-opacity` also has a CSS property counterpart: {{cssxref("fill-opacity")}}. When both are specified, the CSS property takes priority.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement('circle')}}
- {{SVGElement('ellipse')}}
- {{SVGElement('path')}}
- {{SVGElement('polygon')}}
- {{SVGElement('polyline')}}
- {{SVGElement('rect')}}
- {{SVGElement('text')}}
- {{SVGElement('textPath')}}
- {{SVGElement('tspan')}}

## Example

```css hidden

      <td>discrete</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The `fill-rule` attribute provides two options for how the inside (that is, the area to be filled) of a shape is determined:

### nonzero

The value `nonzero` determines the "insideness" of a point in the shape by drawing a ray from that point to infinity in any direction, and then examining the places where a segment of the shape crosses the ray. Starting with a count of zero, add one each time a path segment crosses the ray from left to right and subtract one each time a path segment crosses the ray from right to left. After counting the crossings, if the result is zero then the point is outside the path. Otherwise, it is inside.

#### Example

```css hidden
html,
body,
svg {
  height: 100%;
}
```

```html
<svg viewBox="-10 -10 320 120" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">

    d="M210,0  h90 v90 h-90 z
           M230,20 v50 h50 v-50 z" />
</svg>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('nonzero', '100%', 200)}}

### evenodd

The value `evenodd` determines the "insideness" of a point in the shape by drawing a ray from that point to infinity in any direction and counting the number of path segments from the given shape that the ray crosses. If this number is odd, the point is inside; if even, the point is outside.

#### Example

```css hidden
html,
body,
svg {
  height: 100%;
}

# fill

The **`fill`** attribute has two different meanings. For shapes and text it's a presentation attribute that defines the color (_or any SVG paint servers like gradients or patterns_) used to paint the element; for animation it defines the final state of the animation.

> [!NOTE]
> When used as a presentation attribute, `fill` also has a CSS property counterpart: {{cssxref("fill")}}. When both are specified, the CSS property takes priority.

The SVG presentational `fill` attribute and the CSS {{cssxref("fill")}} property can be used with the following SVG elements:

The SVG `fill` attribute can be used to define the final animation state with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement('animate')}}
- {{SVGElement('animateMotion')}}
- {{SVGElement('animateTransform')}}
- {{SVGElement('set')}}.

## Examples

### Basic color and gradient fills, and animation

```css hidden
html,
body,
svg {
  height: 100%;
}
```

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 300 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <!-- Basic color fill -->
  <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="pink" />

  <!-- Fill circle with a gradient -->
  <defs>
    <radialGradient id="myGradient">
      <stop offset="0%" stop-color="pink" />
      <stop offset="100%" stop-color="black" />
    </radialGradient>
  </defs>

  <circle cx="150" cy="50" r="40" fill="url(#myGradient)" />

  <!--
  Keeping the final state of an animated circle
  which is a circle with a radius of 40.
  -->
  <circle cx="250" cy="50" r="20">
    <animate
      attributeType="XML"
      attributeName="r"
      from="0"
      to="40"
      dur="5s"
      fill="freeze" />
  </circle>
</svg>
```

### `context-fill` example

In this example, we define three shapes using {{SVGElement('path')}} elements, each with a different [`stroke`](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/stroke) and `fill` color set on them. We also define a {{SVGElement('circle')}} element as a marker via the {{SVGElement('marker')}} element. Each shape has the marker applied via the `marker` CSS property.

The {{SVGElement('circle')}} has `stroke="context-stroke"` and `fill="context-fill"` set on it. Because it is being set as a marker in the context of the shapes, these attributes cause it to inherit the `fill` and `stroke` set on the {{SVGElement('path')}} element in each case.

```html-nolint
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 300 90">
  <style>
    path {
      stroke-width: 2px;
      marker: url("#circle");
    }
  </style>
  <path d="M 10 44.64 L 30 10 L 70 10 L 90 44.64 L 70 79.28 L 30 79.28 Z"
        stroke="red" fill="orange" />
  <path d="M 100 44.64 L 80 10 L 120 10 L 140 44.64 L 120 79.28 L 80 79.28 Z"
        stroke="green" fill="lightgreen" />
  <path d="M 150 44.64 L 130 10 L 170 10 L 190 44.64 L 170 79.28 L 130 79.28 Z"
        stroke="blue" fill="lightblue" />
  <marker id="circle" markerWidth="12" markerHeight="12"
          refX="6" refY="6" markerUnits="userSpaceOnUse">
    <circle cx="6" cy="6" r="3" stroke-width="2"
            stroke="context-stroke" fill="context-fill"  />
  </marker>
</svg>
```

The output is as follows:

{{EmbedLiveSample("`context-stroke` example", '100%', 220)}}

> [!NOTE]
> Elements can also use `context-stroke` and `context-fill` to inherit `stroke` and `fill` values when they are referenced by {{SVGElement('use')}} elements.

# filter

The **`filter`** attribute specifies the filter effects defined by the {{SVGElement("filter")}} element that shall be applied to its element.

> [!NOTE]
> As a presentation attribute, `filter` also has a CSS property counterpart: {{cssxref("filter")}}. When both are specified, the CSS property takes priority.

Technically, `filter` can be applied to any element, but it only has effect on [container elements](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element#container_elements) without the {{SVGElement("defs")}} element, all [graphics elements](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element#graphics_elements), and the {{SVGElement("use")}} element.

- `userSpaceOnUse`
  - : {{SVGAttr("x")}}, {{SVGAttr("y")}}, {{SVGAttr("width")}} and {{SVGAttr("height")}} represent values in the current coordinate system that results from taking the current user coordinate system in place at the time when the {{SVGElement("filter")}} element is referenced (i.e., the user coordinate system for the element referencing the {{SVGElement("filter")}} element via a {{SVGAttr("filter")}} attribute).
- `objectBoundingBox`
  - : In that case, {{SVGAttr("x")}}, {{SVGAttr("y")}}, {{SVGAttr("width")}} and {{SVGAttr("height")}} represent fractions or percentages of the bounding box on the referencing element.

  - : Choose the size of the font based only on the {{ Cssxref("font-size") }} property.
- {{cssxref("&lt;number&gt;")}}
  - : Choose the size of the font so that its lowercase letters (as determined by the x-height of the font) are the specified number times the {{ Cssxref("font-size") }}.

    The number specified should generally be the {{glossary("aspect ratio")}} (ratio of x-height to font size) of the first choice {{ Cssxref("font-family") }}. This means that the first-choice font, when available, will appear the same size in browsers, whether or not they support `font-size-adjust`.

    `0` yields text of zero height (hidden text).

```

{{EmbedLiveSample("changing_the_value_of_fr", "480", "200")}}

### The focal point's relationship to `(fx, fy)`

This example has `fr` equal to `5%` and is representing how the attributes `fx` and `fy` (the points labeled as such in the SVG) act as the origin for the focal point of the radial gradient. This focal point is a circle whose radius (the value of `fr`) defines when the first color stop, in this case the color red, should start transitioning into the other color stop, which in this case is the color blue.

# from

The **`from`** attribute indicates the initial value of the attribute that will be modified during the animation.

When used with the {{SVGAttr("to")}} attribute, the animation will change the modified attribute from the `from` value to the `to` value. When used with the {{SVGAttr("by")}} attribute, the animation will change the attribute relatively from the `from` value by the value specified in `by`.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("animate")}}
- {{SVGElement("animateMotion")}}
- {{SVGElement("animateTransform")}}

## Example

```css hidden
html,
body,
svg {
  height: 100%;
}
```

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">

# glyph-orientation-horizontal

{{Deprecated_Header}}

The **`glyph-orientation-horizontal`** attribute affects the amount that the current text position advances as each {{Glossary("glyph")}} is rendered.

When the reference orientation direction is horizontal and the `glyph-orientation-horizontal` results in an orientation angle that is a multiple of 180 degrees, then the current text position is incremented according to the horizontal metrics of the glyph. Otherwise, if the value of this attribute is not a multiple of 180 degrees, then the current text position is incremented according to the vertical metrics of the glyph.

This attribute is applied only to text written in a horizontal {{SVGAttr("writing-mode")}}.

> [!NOTE]
> As a presentation attribute, `glyph-orientation-horizontal` also has a CSS property counterpart: {{cssxref("glyph-orientation-horizontal")}}. When both are specified, the CSS property takes priority.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("textPath")}}
- {{SVGElement("text")}}
- {{SVGElement("tspan")}}

    A value of `0deg` indicates that all glyphs are set with the top of the glyphs oriented towards the reference orientation. A value of `90deg` indicates an orientation of 90 degrees clockwise from the reference orientation.

# glyph-orientation-vertical

{{Deprecated_Header}}

The **`glyph-orientation-vertical`** attribute affects the amount that the current text position advances as each {{Glossary("glyph")}} is rendered.

When the inline-progression-direction is vertical and the `glyph-orientation-vertical` results in an orientation angle that is a multiple of 180 degrees, then the current text position is incremented according to the vertical metrics of the glyph. Otherwise, if the angle is not a multiple of 180 degrees, then the current text position is incremented according to the horizontal metrics of the glyph.

This attribute is applied only to text written in a vertical {{SVGAttr("writing-mode")}}.

> [!NOTE]
> As a presentation attribute, `glyph-orientation-vertical` also has a CSS property counterpart: {{cssxref("glyph-orientation-vertical")}}. When both are specified, the CSS property takes priority.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("textPath")}}
- {{SVGElement("text")}}
- {{SVGElement("tspan")}}

  </tbody>
</table>

- `auto`
  - : Fullwidth {{Glossary("ideographic")}} and fullwidth Latin text will be set with a glyph orientation of 0 degrees. Ideographic punctuation and other ideographic characters having alternate horizontal and vertical forms will use the vertical form of the glyph. Text which is not fullwidth will be set with a glyph orientation of 90 degrees.

    This reorientation rule applies only to the first-level non-ideographic text. All further embedding of writing modes or bidirectional processing will be based on the first-level rotation.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Text set in this "rotated" manner may contain ligatures or other glyph combining and reordering common to the language and script. (This presentation form does not disable auto-ligature formation or similar context-driven variations.)

    The determination of which characters should be auto-rotated may vary across user agents. The determination is based on a complex interaction between country, language, script, character properties, font, and character context.

- `<angle>`
  - : The value of the angle is restricted to 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees. If another angle is specified, it is rounded to the closest of the permitted values.
    A value of `0deg` indicates that all glyphs are set with the top of the glyphs oriented towards the reference orientation. A value of `90deg` indicates an orientation of 90 degrees clockwise from the reference orientation.

# gradientTransform

The **`gradientTransform`** attribute contains the definition of an optional additional transformation from the gradient coordinate system onto the target coordinate system (i.e., userSpaceOnUse or objectBoundingBox). This allows for things such as skewing the gradient. This additional transformation matrix is post-multiplied to (i.e., inserted to the right of) any previously defined transformations, including the implicit transformation necessary to convert from object bounding box units to user space.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("linearGradient")}}
- {{SVGElement("radialGradient")}}

## Example

```css hidden
html,
body,
svg {
  height: 100%;
}
```

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 420 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <radialGradient
    id="gradient1"

# gradientUnits

The **`gradientUnits`** attribute defines the coordinate system used for attributes specified on the gradient elements.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("linearGradient")}}
- {{SVGElement("radialGradient")}}

## linearGradient

For {{SVGElement("linearGradient")}}, `gradientUnits` defines the coordinate system used for the attributes {{SVGAttr("x1")}}, {{SVGAttr("y1")}}, {{SVGAttr("x2")}}, and {{SVGAttr("y2")}}.

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td><code>userSpaceOnUse</code> | <code>objectBoundingBox</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Default value</th>
      <td><code>objectBoundingBox</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Animatable</th>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

- `userSpaceOnUse`
  - : This value indicates that the attributes represent values in the coordinate system that results from taking the current user coordinate system in place at the time when the gradient element is referenced (i.e., the user coordinate system for the element referencing the gradient element via a {{SVGAttr("fill")}} or {{SVGAttr("stroke")}} property) and then applying the transform specified by attribute {{SVGAttr("gradientTransform")}}.
    Percentages represent values relative to the current SVG viewport.
- `objectBoundingBox`
  - : This value indicates that the user coordinate system for the attributes is established using the bounding box of the element to which the gradient is applied and then applying the transform specified by attribute `gradientTransform`.

    Percentages represent values relative to the bounding box for the object.

    With this value and `gradientTransform` being the identity matrix, the normal of the linear gradient is perpendicular to the gradient vector in object bounding box space (i.e., the abstract coordinate system where (0,0) is at the top/left of the object bounding box and (1,1) is at the bottom/right of the object bounding box). When the object's bounding box is not square, the gradient normal which is initially perpendicular to the gradient vector within object bounding box space may render non-perpendicular relative to the gradient vector in user space. If the gradient vector is parallel to one of the axes of the bounding box, the gradient normal will remain perpendicular. This transformation is due to application of the non-uniform scaling transformation from bounding box space to user space.

## radialGradient

For {{SVGElement("radialGradient")}}, `gradientUnits` defines the coordinate system used for the attributes {{SVGAttr("cx")}}, {{SVGAttr("cy")}}, {{SVGAttr("r")}}, {{SVGAttr("fx")}}, {{SVGAttr("fy")}}, and {{SVGAttr("fr")}}.

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td><code>userSpaceOnUse</code> | <code>objectBoundingBox</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Default value</th>
      <td><code>objectBoundingBox</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Animatable</th>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

- `userSpaceOnUse`
  - : {{SVGAttr("cx")}}, {{SVGAttr("cy")}}, {{SVGAttr("r")}}, {{SVGAttr("fx")}}, {{SVGAttr("fy")}}, and {{SVGAttr("fr")}} represent values in the coordinate system that results from taking the current user coordinate system in place at the time when the gradient element is referenced (i.e., the user coordinate system for the element referencing the gradient element via a {{SVGAttr("fill")}} or {{SVGAttr("stroke")}} property) and then applying the transform specified by attribute {{SVGAttr("gradientTransform")}}.
- `objectBoundingBox`
  - : for {{SVGElement("radialGradient")}}: the user coordinate system for attributes {{SVGAttr("cx")}}, {{SVGAttr("cy")}}, {{SVGAttr("r")}}, {{SVGAttr("fx")}}, {{SVGAttr("fy")}}, and {{SVGAttr("fr")}} is established using the bounding box of the element to which the gradient is applied (see Object bounding box units) and then applying the transform specified by attribute `gradientTransform`.
    With this value and `gradientTransform` being the identity matrix, the rings of the radial gradient are circular with respect to the object bounding box space (i.e., the abstract coordinate system where (0,0) is at the top/left of the object bounding box and (1,1) is at the bottom/right of the object bounding box). When the object's bounding box is not square, the rings that are conceptually circular within object bounding box space will render as elliptical due to application of the non-uniform scaling transformation from bounding box space to user space.

## Specifications

- CSS {{cssxref("height")}} property
# href

The **`href`** attribute defines a link to a resource as a reference [URL](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Guides/Content_type#url). The exact meaning of that link depends on the context of each element using it.

> [!NOTE]
> Specifications before SVG 2 defined an {{SVGAttr("xlink:href")}} attribute, which is now rendered obsolete by the `href` attribute. If you need to support earlier browser versions, the deprecated `xlink:href` attribute can be used as a fallback in addition to the `href` attribute, e.g., `<use href="some-id" xlink:href="some-id" x="5" y="5" />`.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("a")}}
- {{SVGElement("animate")}}
- {{SVGElement("animateMotion")}}
- {{SVGElement("animateTransform")}}
- {{SVGElement("feImage")}}
- {{SVGElement("image")}}
- {{SVGElement("linearGradient")}}
- {{SVGElement("mpath")}}
- {{SVGElement("pattern")}}
- {{SVGElement("radialGradient")}}
- {{SVGElement("script")}}
- {{SVGElement("set")}}
- {{SVGElement("textPath")}}
- {{SVGElement("use")}}

## Example

```css hidden
html,
body,
svg {
  height: 100%;
}
```

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 160 40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">
    <text x="10" y="25">MDN Web Docs</text>
  </a>
</svg>
```

## In SVG

### a

For {{SVGElement("a")}}, `href` defines the location of the referenced object, expressed as a URL reference.

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td>
        <code
          ><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Guides/Content_type#url">&#x3C;url></a></code
        >
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Default value</th>
      <td><em>None</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Animatable</th>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### animate, animateMotion, animateTransform, set

For the {{SVGElement("animate")}}, {{SVGElement("animateMotion")}}, {{SVGElement("animateTransform")}}, and {{SVGElement("set")}}, `href` defines a URL referring to the element which is the target of this animation element and which therefore will be modified over time.

The URL must point to exactly one target element which is capable of being the target of the given animation element. If the URL points to multiple target elements, if the given target element is not capable of being a target of the given animation element, or if the given target element is not part of the current document, then the animation element will not affect any target element. However, the animation element will still operate normally with regard to its timing properties. Specifically, TimeEvents are dispatched and the animation element can be used as syncbase in an identical fashion to when the URL refers to a valid target element.

If the `href` attribute or the deprecated {{SVGAttr("xlink:href")}} attribute is not provided, then the target element will be the immediate parent element of the current animation element. If both `xlink:href` and `href` are specified, the value of the latter attribute is used.

Refer to the descriptions of the individual animation elements for any restrictions on what types of elements can be targets of particular types of animations.

Except for any SVG-specific rules explicitly mentioned in this specification, the normative definition for this attribute is the {{Glossary("SMIL")}} Animation specification. In particular, see [SMIL Animation: Specifying the animation target](https://www.w3.org/TR/smil-animation/#SpecifyingAnimationTarget).

### feImage

For {{SVGElement("feImage")}}, `href` defines a URL referring to an image resource or to an element. If both, the {{SVGAttr("xlink:href")}} and the `href` attribute are specified, the latter overrides the former.

<table class="properties">

      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td>
        <code

</svg>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("image", 200, 250)}}

### linearGradient/radialGradient

For {{SVGElement("linearGradient")}} or {{SVGElement("radialGradient")}}, `href` defines URL referring to a template gradient element; to be valid, the reference must be to a different `<linearGradient>` or `<radialGradient>` element.

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td>
        <code

      <th scope="row">Animatable</th>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### mpath

For {{SVGElement("mpath")}}, `href` defines a URL referring to the {{SVGElement("path")}} element or [basic shape](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_shapes/Basic_shapes) which defines the motion path.

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td>
        <code

      <th scope="row">Animatable</th>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### pattern

For {{SVGElement("pattern")}}, `href` defines a URL referring to a different `<pattern>` element within the current SVG document. Any attributes which are defined on the referenced element which are not defined on this element are inherited by this element. If this element has no children, and the referenced element does (possibly due to its own `href` attribute), then this element inherits the children from the referenced element. Inheritance can be indirect to an arbitrary level; thus, if the referenced element inherits attributes or children due to its own `href` attribute, then the current element can inherit those attributes or children. On the {{SVGElement("pattern")}} element, the `href` attribute is animatable.

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td>
        <code
          ><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Guides/Content_type#url">&#x3C;url></a></code

      <th scope="row">Animatable</th>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### script

For {{SVGElement("script")}}, `href` defines a URL referring to an external resource containing the script code.

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td>
        <code

    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Animatable</th>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### textPath

For {{SVGElement("textPath")}}, `href` defines a URL referring to the {{SVGElement("path")}} element or [basic shape](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_shapes/Basic_shapes) onto which the text will be rendered if no {{SVGAttr("path")}} attribute is provided. On the {{SVGElement("textPath")}} element, the `href` attribute is animatable.

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td>
        <code
          ><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Guides/Content_type#url">&#x3C;url></a></code

      <th scope="row">Default value</th>
      <td><em>None</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Animatable</th>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### use

For {{SVGElement("use")}}, `href` defines a URL referring to an element or fragment within an SVG document to be cloned.

The `<use>` element can reference an entire SVG document by specifying an `href` value without a fragment. Such references are taken to be referring to the root element of the referenced document.

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>

# id

The **`id`** attribute assigns a unique name to an element.

You can use this attribute with any SVG element.

## Example

```html
<svg
  width="120"
  height="120"
  viewBox="0 0 120 120"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <style>
    <![CDATA[
      #smallRect {
        stroke: #000066;
        fill: #00cc00;
      }
    ]]>
  </style>

  <rect id="smallRect" x="10" y="10" width="100" height="100" />
</svg>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Example", "120", "120")}}

## Usage notes

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td>&#x3C;id></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Default value</th>
      <td><em>None</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Animatable</th>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

- \<id>
  - : Specifies the element's ID. The ID must be unique within the node tree, must not be an empty string, and must not contain any whitespace characters.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You should avoid the use of `id` values that would be parsed as an SVG view specification (e.g., `MyDrawing.svg#svgView(viewBox(0,200,1000,1000))`) or a basic media fragment when used as a URL target fragment.

    It must be valid in XML documents. A stand-alone SVG document uses XML 1.0 syntax, which specifies that valid IDs only include designated characters (letters, digits, and a few punctuation marks), and do not start with a digit, a full stop (.) character, or a hyphen-minus (-) character.

# image-rendering

The **`image-rendering`** attribute provides a hint to the browser about how to make speed vs. quality tradeoffs as it performs image processing.

The resampling is always done in a true color (e.g., 24-bit) color space even if the original data and/or the target device is indexed color.

> [!NOTE]
> As a presentation attribute, `image-rendering` also has a CSS property counterpart: {{cssxref("image-rendering")}}. When both are specified, the CSS property takes priority.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("image")}}

## Usage notes

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td>
        <code>auto</code> | <code>optimizeSpeed</code> |
        <code>optimizeQuality</code>
      </td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Animatable</th>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

- `auto`
  - : Indicates that the user agent shall make appropriate tradeoffs to balance speed and quality, but quality shall be given more importance than speed.
- `optimizeSpeed`
  - : Indicates that the user agent shall emphasize rendering speed over quality.
- `optimizeQuality`
  - : Indicates that the user agent shall emphasize quality over rendering speed.

# in2

The **`in2`** attribute identifies the second input for the given filter primitive. It works exactly like the {{SVGAttr("in")}} attribute.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("feBlend")}}
- {{SVGElement("feComposite")}}
- {{SVGElement("feDisplacementMap")}}

## feBlend

For {{SVGElement("feBlend")}}, `in2` defines the second input image to the blending operation.

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>

      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td>

      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Animatable</th>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## feComposite

For {{SVGElement("feComposite")}}, `in2` defines the second input image to the compositing operation.

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td>
        <code>SourceGraphic</code> | <code>SourceAlpha</code> |

      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Animatable</th>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## feDisplacementMap

For {{SVGElement("feDisplacementMap")}}, `in2` defines the second input image, which is used to displace the pixels in the image defined in the {{SVGAttr("in")}} attribute.

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td>
        <code>SourceGraphic</code> | <code>SourceAlpha</code> |

      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>

# in

The **`in`** attribute identifies input for the given filter primitive.

The value can be either one of the six keywords defined below, or a string which matches a previous {{SVGAttr("result")}} attribute value within the same {{SVGElement("filter")}} element. If no value is provided and this is the first filter primitive, then this filter primitive will use `SourceGraphic` as its input. If no value is provided and this is a subsequent filter primitive, then this filter primitive will use the result from the previous filter primitive as its input.

If the value for {{SVGAttr("result")}} appears multiple times within a given {{SVGElement("filter")}} element, then a reference to that result will use the closest preceding filter primitive with the given value for attribute {{SVGAttr("result")}}.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("feBlend")}}
- {{SVGElement("feColorMatrix")}}
- {{SVGElement("feComponentTransfer")}}
- {{SVGElement("feComposite")}}
- {{SVGElement("feConvolveMatrix")}}
- {{SVGElement("feDiffuseLighting")}}
- {{SVGElement("feDisplacementMap")}}
- {{SVGElement("feDropShadow")}}
- {{SVGElement("feGaussianBlur")}}
- {{SVGElement("feMergeNode")}}
- {{SVGElement("feMorphology")}}
- {{SVGElement("feOffset")}}
- {{SVGElement("feSpecularLighting")}}
- {{SVGElement("feTile")}}

## Usage notes

    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td>
        <code>SourceGraphic</code> | <code>SourceAlpha</code> |
        <code>BackgroundImage</code> | <code>BackgroundAlpha</code> |
        <code>FillPaint</code> | <code>StrokePaint</code> |

- `SourceGraphic`
  - : This keyword represents the graphics elements that were the original input into the {{SVGElement("filter")}} element.
- `SourceAlpha`
  - : This keyword represents the graphics elements that were the original input into the `<filter>` element. `SourceAlpha` has all of the same rules as `SourceGraphic` except that only the alpha channel is used.
- `BackgroundImage`
  - : This keyword represents an image snapshot of the SVG document under the filter region at the time that the `<filter>` element was invoked.
- `BackgroundAlpha`
  - : Same as `BackgroundImage` except only the alpha channel is used.
- `FillPaint`
  - : This keyword represents the value of the {{SVGAttr("fill")}} property on the target element for the filter effect. In many cases, the `FillPaint` is opaque everywhere, but that might not be the case if a shape is painted with a gradient or pattern which itself includes transparent or semi-transparent parts.
- `StrokePaint`
  - : This keyword represents the value of the {{SVGAttr("stroke")}} property on the target element for the filter effect. In many cases, the `StrokePaint` is opaque everywhere, but that might not be the case if a shape is painted with a gradient or pattern which itself includes transparent or semi-transparent parts.
- `<filter-primitive-reference>`
  - : This value is an assigned name for the filter primitive in the form of a {{cssxref("custom-ident")}}. If supplied, then graphics that result from processing this filter primitive can be referenced by an in attribute on a subsequent filter primitive within the same filter element. If no value is provided, the output will only be available for re-use as the implicit input into the next filter primitive if that filter primitive provides no value for its in attribute.

## Workaround for BackgroundImage

`BackgroundImage` is not supported as a filter source in modern browsers (see the [feComposite compatibility table](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/feComposite#browser_compatibility)). We therefore need to import one of the images to blend inside the filter itself, using an `<feImage>` element.

> [!NOTE]
> Firefox [Bug 455986](https://bugzil.la/455986) means that `feImage` cannot load partial images, including circles, rectangles, paths or other fragments defined in the document. So that this example works on more browsers, a full external image of the logo is loaded.

# intercept

The **`intercept`** attribute defines the intercept of the linear function of color component transfers when the {{SVGAttr("type")}} attribute is set to `linear`.

The `linear` function is defined as `slope * color + intercept`, where `color` is the color value, the `intercept` provides a base value for the result, and the [`slope`](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/slope) is a scaling factor.

The `intercept` attribute is supported by children of the {{SVGElement("feComponentTransfer")}} filter primitive and is used with the following SVG component transfer function elements when `type="linear"` is set:

- {{SVGElement("feFuncA")}}
- {{SVGElement("feFuncB")}}
- {{SVGElement("feFuncG")}}
- {{SVGElement("feFuncR")}}

# kernelUnitLength

The **`kernelUnitLength`** attribute has two meanings based on the context it's used in. For lighting filter primitives, it indicates the intended distance for the x and y coordinates, for {{SVGElement("feConvolveMatrix")}}, it indicates the intended distance between successive columns and rows in the kernel matrix.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("feConvolveMatrix")}}
- {{SVGElement("feDiffuseLighting")}}
- {{SVGElement("feSpecularLighting")}}

## feConvolveMatrix

For the {{SVGElement("feConvolveMatrix")}}, `kernelUnitLength` indicates the intended distance in current filter units (i.e., units as determined by the value of {{SVGAttr("primitiveUnits")}} attribute) between successive columns and rows, respectively, in the {{SVGAttr("kernelMatrix")}}. By specifying value(s) for `kernelUnitLength`, the kernel becomes defined in a scalable, abstract coordinate system. If the attribute is not specified, the default value is one pixel in the offscreen bitmap, which is a pixel-based coordinate system, and thus potentially not scalable.

If a negative or zero value is specified the default value will be used instead.

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

- `<number-optional-number>`
  - : The first number is the x value. The second number is the y value. If the x value is not specified, it defaults to the same value as x.

## feDiffuseLighting

For the {{SVGElement("feDiffuseLighting")}}, `kernelUnitLength` indicates the intended distance in current filter units (i.e., units as determined by the value of attribute {{SVGAttr("primitiveUnits")}}) for the x and y coordinate, respectively, in the surface normal calculation formulas.

The first number is the x value. The second number is the y value. If the y value is not specified, it defaults to the same value as x. By specifying value(s) for `kernelUnitLength`, the kernel becomes defined in a scalable, abstract coordinate system. If the attribute is not specified, the x and y values represent very small deltas relative to a given position, which might be implemented in some cases as one pixel in the intermediate image offscreen bitmap, which is a pixel-based coordinate system, and thus potentially not scalable.

If a negative or zero value is specified the default value will be used instead.

## feSpecularLighting

For the {{SVGElement("feSpecularLighting")}}, `kernelUnitLength` indicates the intended distance in current filter units (i.e., units as determined by the value of attribute {{SVGAttr("primitiveUnits")}}) for the x and y coordinate, respectively, in the surface normal calculation formulas.

The first number is the x value. The second number is the y value. If the y value is not specified, it defaults to the same value as x. By specifying value(s) for `kernelUnitLength`, the kernel becomes defined in a scalable, abstract coordinate system. If the attribute is not specified, the x and y values represent very small deltas relative to a given position, which might be implemented in some cases as one pixel in the intermediate image offscreen bitmap, which is a pixel-based coordinate system, and thus potentially not scalable.

The distance is calculated along the path specified by the {{SVGAttr("path")}} attribute. Each progress value in the list corresponds to a value in the `keyTimes` attribute list.

    If a list of key points is specified, there must be exactly as many values in the `keyPoints` list as in the `keyTimes` list.

    If there's a semicolon at the end of the value, optionally followed by white space, both the semicolon and the trailing white space are ignored.

    If there are any errors in the value specification (i.e., bad values, too many or too few values), then that's an error.

The attribute value is a semicolon-separated list of control point descriptions.

- `<control-point>`
  - : Each control point description is a set of four values: `x1 y1 x2 y2`, describing the Bézier control points for one time segment. The {{SVGAttr("keyTimes")}} values that define the associated segment are the Bézier "anchor points", and the `keySplines` values are the control points. Thus, there must be one fewer sets of control points than there are {{SVGAttr("keyTimes")}}.

    The values of `x1 y1 x2 y2` must all be in the range 0 to 1.

- Safari issues
  - : `keyTimes` values should be separated with semicolon without space before, f.e: `keyTimes="0; 0.25; 0.5; 0.75; 1"`

# keyTimes

The **`keyTimes`** attribute represents a list of time values used to control the pacing of the animation.

Each time in the list corresponds to a value in the {{SVGAttr("values")}} attribute list, and defines when the value is used in the animation. Each time value in the `keyTimes` list is specified as a floating point value between 0 and 1 (inclusive), representing a proportional offset into the duration of the animation element.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("animate")}}
- {{SVGElement("animateMotion")}}
- {{SVGElement("animateTransform")}}

## Example

```css hidden
html,
body,
svg {
  height: 100%;

The value of the `keyTimes` attribute is a semicolon-separated list of values.

There must be exactly as many values in the `keyTimes` list as in the `values` list.

Each successive time value must be greater than or equal to the preceding time value.

The `keyTimes` list semantics depends upon the {{Glossary("interpolation")}} mode:

- For linear and spline animation, the first time value in the list must be 0, and the last time value in the list must be `1`. The key time associated with each value defines when the value is set; values are interpolated between the key times.
- For discrete animation, the first time value in the list must be `0`. The time associated with each value defines when the value is set; the animation function uses that value until the next time defined in the list.

If the {{SVGAttr("calcMode")}} attribute is set to `paced`, the `keyTimes` attribute is ignored.

If the duration of the animation is indefinite, any `keyTimes` specification will be ignored.

- Safari issue: `keyTimes` values should be separated with semicolon without space before, f.e: `keyTimes="0; 0.25; 0.5; 0.75; 1"`

# lang

The **`lang`** attribute specifies the primary language used in contents and attributes containing text content of particular elements.

There is also an {{SVGAttr("xml:lang")}} attribute (with namespace). If both of them are defined, the one with namespace is used and the one without is ignored.

In SVG 1.1 there was a `lang` attribute defined with a different meaning and only applying to `<glyph>` elements. That attribute specified a list of {{glossary("BCP 47 language tag", "BCP 47 language tags")}}. The glyph was meant to be used if the `xml:lang` attribute exactly matched one of the languages given in the value of this parameter, or if the `xml:lang` attribute exactly equaled a prefix of one of the languages given in the value of this parameter such that the first tag character following the prefix was "-".

You can use this attribute with any SVG element.

## Example

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 200 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <text lang="en-US">This is some English text</text>

- `<language-tag>`
  - : This value specifies the language used for the element as a valid {{glossary("BCP 47 language tag")}}.

    The most common syntax is a value formed by a lowercase two-character part for the language and an uppercase two-character part for the region or country, separated by a minus sign, e.g., `en-US` for US English or `de-AT` for Austrian German.

# letter-spacing

The **`letter-spacing`** attribute controls spacing between text characters.

If the attribute value is a unitless number (like `128`), the browser processes it as a {{cssxref("length")}} in the current user coordinate system.

If the attribute value has a unit identifier, such as `.25em` or `1%`, then the browser converts the `<length>` into its corresponding value in the current user coordinate system.

> [!NOTE]
> As a presentation attribute, `letter-spacing` also has a CSS property counterpart: {{cssxref("letter-spacing")}}. When both are specified, the CSS property takes priority.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("text")}}
- {{SVGElement("textPath")}}
- {{SVGElement("tspan")}}

## Examples

# marker-end

The **`marker-end`** attribute defines the arrowhead or polymarker that will be drawn at the final vertex of the given [shape](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element#shape_elements).

For all shape elements, except {{SVGElement("polyline")}} and {{SVGElement("path")}}, the last vertex is the same as the first vertex. In this case, if the value of {{SVGAttr("marker-start")}} and `marker-end` are both not `none`, then two markers will be rendered on that final vertex. For `<path>` elements, for each closed subpath, the last vertex is the same as the first vertex. `marker-end` is only rendered on the final vertex of the [path data](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/d#path_commands).

## mask

For {{SVGElement("mask")}}, the `mask-type` defines whether the content of the mask element is treated as a luminance mask or an alpha mask.

<table class="properties">

</table>

- `alpha`
  - : This value indicates that the {{SVGElement('mask')}} element's alpha values should be used; the pixels of the masked object match the opaqueness of the mask areas, without regard to the luminance of the colors of the mask.
- `luminance`
  - : This value indicates that the {{SVGElement('mask')}} element's luminance values should be used; the opaqueness of the masked object depends on the opacity and lightness of the mask. The opacity of a `luminance` mask is determined by the `R`, `G`, `B`, and `A` channels of the mask, using the equation `((0.2125 * R) + (0.7154 * G) + (0.0721 * B)) * A`.

- {{SVGElement('clipPath')}}
- {{SVGElement('ellipse')}}
- {{SVGElement('g')}}
- {{SVGElement('image')}}

# numOctaves

The **`numOctaves`** attribute defines the number of octaves for the noise function of the {{SVGElement("feTurbulence")}} primitive.

An octave is a noise function defined by its frequency and amplitude. A turbulence is built by accumulating several octaves with increasing frequencies and decreasing amplitudes.
The higher the number of octaves, the more natural the noise looks. Though more octaves also require more calculations, resulting in a negative impact on performance.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("feTurbulence")}}

## Example

### Example 1

```css hidden
html,
body,
svg {
  height: 100%;
}
```

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 420 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <filter id="noise1" x="0" y="0" width="100%" height="100%">

# opacity

The **`opacity`** attribute specifies the transparency of an object or of a group of objects, that is, the degree to which the background behind the element is overlaid.

> [!NOTE]
> As a presentation attribute, `opacity` also has a CSS property counterpart: {{cssxref("opacity")}}. When both are specified, the CSS property takes priority.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("a")}}
- {{SVGElement("circle")}}
- {{SVGElement("ellipse")}}
- {{SVGElement("foreignObject")}}
- {{SVGElement("g")}}
- {{SVGElement("image")}}
- {{SVGElement("line")}}
- {{SVGElement("marker")}}
- {{SVGElement("path")}}
- {{SVGElement("polygon")}}
- {{SVGElement("polyline")}}
- {{SVGElement("rect")}}
- {{SVGElement("svg")}}
- {{SVGElement("switch")}}
- {{SVGElement("symbol")}}
- {{SVGElement("text")}}
- {{SVGElement("textPath")}}
- {{SVGElement("tspan")}}
- {{SVGElement("use")}}

Unlike {{SVGAttr("fill-opacity")}}, {{SVGAttr("stroke-opacity")}}, and {{SVGAttr("stop-opacity")}}, which are applied to individual operations and are rendered _when_ the element is rendered, `opacity` is applied to whole objects or groups, and is more like a post-processing operation on the rendered image of the object or group. Therefore, when you have both `opacity` and the other opacity attributes in the same area, they will be overlaid on top of each other and cause the opacity to be multiplied.

## Example

```css hidden
html,
body,
svg {
  height: 100%;
}
```

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 200 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">

# operator

The **`operator`** attribute has two meanings based on the context it's used in. Either it defines the compositing or morphing operation to be performed.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("feComposite")}}
- {{SVGElement("feMorphology")}}

## Example

```css hidden
html,
body,
svg {
  height: 100%;
  font:
    20px "Helvetica",
    "Arial",
    sans-serif;

    `result = k1*i1*i2 + k2*i1 + k3*i2 + k4`

    where:
    `i1` and `i2` indicate the corresponding pixel channel values of the input image, which map to `in` and `in2` respectively, and {{SVGAttr("k1")}}, {{SVGAttr("k2")}}, {{SVGAttr("k3")}}, and {{SVGAttr("k4")}} indicate the values of the attributes with the same name.

## feMorphology

For {{SVGElement("feMorphology")}}, `operator` defines whether to erode (i.e., thin) or dilate (fatten) the source graphic.

- `<number-optional-number>`
  - : This value indicates the number of cells in each dimension for the kernel matrix. The values provided must be {{cssxref("integer")}}s greater than zero. Values that are not integers will be truncated, i.e., rounded to the closest integer value towards zero. The first number, indicates the number of columns in the matrix. The second number, indicates the number of rows in the matrix. If no second number is not provided, it defaults to the first number.

    It is recommended that only small values (e.g., 3) be used; higher values may result in very high CPU overhead and usually do not produce results that justify the impact on performance.

- `auto-start-reverse`
  - : If placed by {{SVGAttr("marker-start")}}, the marker is oriented 180° different from the orientation that would be used if `auto` were specified. For all other markers, `auto-start-reverse` means the same as `auto`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This allows a single arrowhead marker to be defined that can be used for both the start and end of a path, i.e., which points outwards from both ends.

- `<angle>`
  - : This value indicates that the marker is oriented such that the specified angle is that measured between the shape's positive x-axis and the marker's positive x-axis.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For example, if a value of `45` is given, then the marker's positive x-axis would be pointing down and right in the shape's coordinate system.

- `<number>`

# overflow

The **`overflow`** attribute sets what to do when an element's content is too big to fit in its block formatting context. **This feature is not widely implemented yet**.

This attribute has the same parameter values and meaning as the CSS {{cssxref("overflow")}} property, however, the following additional points apply:

- If it has a value of `visible`, the attribute has no effect (i.e., a clipping rectangle is not created).
- If the `overflow` property has the value `hidden` or `scroll`, a clip of the exact size of the SVG viewport is applied.
- When `scroll` is specified on an {{SVGElement("svg")}} element, a scrollbar or panner is normally shown for the SVG viewport whether or not any of its content is clipped.
- Within SVG content, the value `auto` implies that all rendered content for child elements must be visible, either through a scrolling mechanism, or by rendering with no clip.

> [!NOTE]
> Although the initial value for overflow is `auto`, it is overwritten in the User Agent style sheet for the {{SVGElement("svg")}} element when it is not the root element of a stand-alone document, the {{SVGElement("pattern")}} element, and the {{SVGElement("marker")}} element to be hidden by default.

> [!NOTE]
> As a presentation attribute, `overflow` also has a CSS property counterpart: {{cssxref("overflow")}}. When both are specified, the CSS property takes priority.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("foreignObject")}}
- {{SVGElement("image")}}
- {{SVGElement("marker")}}
- {{SVGElement("pattern")}}
- {{SVGElement("symbol")}}

- normal
  - : This value indicates that the fill will be painted first, then the stroke, and finally the markers.
- \[ fill || stroke || markers ]
  - : The order of these three keywords indicates the order in which the painting happens, from left to right. If any of the three painting components is omitted, they will be painted in their default order after the specified components. For example, using `stroke` is equivalent to `stroke fill markers`.

## Example

```html
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="400" height="200">
  <linearGradient id="g" x1="0" y1="0" x2="0" y2="1">

    <text x="200" y="150" paint-order="stroke" id="stroke-under">
      stroke under
    </text>
  </g>
</svg>
```

The example would be rendered as follows:

  - : This value defines the motion path along which the referenced element is animated. For detailed information about the commands that can be used, see the [explanation for the `d` attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/d#path_commands).

## textPath

For {{SVGElement("textPath")}}, `path` defines the path onto which the {{Glossary("glyph", "glyphs")}} of a {{SVGElement("text")}} element will be rendered. An empty string indicates that there is no path data for the element. This means that the text within the `<textPath>` element does not render or contribute to the bounding box of the `<text>` element. If the attribute is not specified, the path specified in {{SVGAttr("href")}} is used instead.

# pathLength

The **`pathLength`** attribute lets authors specify a total length for the path, in user units. This value is then used to calibrate the browser's distance calculations with those of the author, by scaling all distance computations using the ratio `pathLength` / (_computed value of path length_).

This can affect the actual rendered lengths of paths; including text paths, animation paths, and various stroke operations. Basically, all computations that require the length of the path. {{SVGAttr('stroke-dasharray')}}, for example, will assume the start of the path being 0 and the end point the value defined in the `pathLength` attribute.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement('circle')}}
- {{SVGElement('ellipse')}}
- {{SVGElement('line')}}
- {{SVGElement('path')}}
- {{SVGElement('polygon')}}
- {{SVGElement('polyline')}}
- {{SVGElement('rect')}}

## Example

```css hidden
html,
body,
svg {
  height: 100%;
}
```

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 100 60" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <style>
    path {
      fill: none;
      stroke: black;
      stroke-width: 2;
      stroke-dasharray: 10;
    }
  </style>

  <!-- No pathLength, the real length of the path is used. In that case, 100 user units -->
  <path d="M 0,10 h100" />

  <!-- compute everything like if the path length was 90 user units long -->
  <path d="M 0,20 h100" pathLength="90" />

  <!-- compute everything like if the path length was 50 user units long -->
  <path d="M 0,30 h100" pathLength="50" />

  <!-- compute everything like if the path length was 30 user units long -->
  <path d="M 0,40 h100" pathLength="30" />

  <!-- compute everything like if the path length was 10 user units long -->
  <path d="M 0,50 h100" pathLength="10" />
</svg>

- `true`
  - : This value indicates that the convolution is applied only to the color channels. In this case, the filter temporarily removes alpha premultiplication from the color component values, applies the kernel, and then reapplies alpha premultiplication as a final step.
- `false`
  - : This value indicates that the convolution is applied to all channels, including the alpha channel.

# preserveAspectRatio

The **`preserveAspectRatio`** attribute indicates how an element with a viewBox providing a given {{glossary("aspect ratio")}} must fit into a viewport with a different aspect ratio.

The aspect ratio of an SVG image is defined by the {{SVGAttr('viewBox')}} attribute. Therefore, if `viewBox` isn't set, the `preserveAspectRatio` attribute has no effect on SVG's scaling (except in the case of the {{SVGElement('image')}} element, where `preserveAspectRatio` behaves differently as described below).

## Syntax

```plain
preserveAspectRatio="<align> [<meet or slice>]"
```

The `preserveAspectRatio` attribute value consists of up to two keywords: a required alignment value and an optional `meet` or `slice` keyword.

The alignment value indicates whether to force uniform scaling and, if so, the alignment method to use in case the aspect ratio of the {{ SVGAttr("viewBox") }} doesn't match the aspect ratio of the viewport. `xMidYMid` is the default value. The alignment value must be one of the following keyword values:

- `none`
  - : Does not force uniform scaling. Scale the graphic content of the given element non-uniformly if necessary such that the element's bounding box exactly matches the viewport rectangle. Note that if `<align>` is `none`, then the optional `<meetOrSlice>` value is ignored.

- `xMinYMin`
  - : Forces uniform scaling.
    Align the `<min-x>` of the element's {{ SVGAttr("viewBox") }} with the smallest X value of the viewport.
    Align the `<min-y>` of the element's {{ SVGAttr("viewBox") }} with the smallest Y value of the viewport.

- `xMidYMin`
  - : Forces uniform scaling.
    Align the midpoint X value of the element's {{ SVGAttr("viewBox") }} with the midpoint X value of the viewport.
    Align the `<min-y>` of the element's {{ SVGAttr("viewBox") }} with the smallest Y value of the viewport.

- `xMaxYMin`
  - : Forces uniform scaling.
    Align the `<min-x>+<width>` of the element's {{ SVGAttr("viewBox") }} with the maximum X value of the viewport.
    Align the `<min-y>` of the element's {{ SVGAttr("viewBox") }} with the smallest Y value of the viewport.

- `xMinYMid`
  - : Forces uniform scaling.
    Align the `<min-x>` of the element's {{ SVGAttr("viewBox") }} with the smallest X value of the viewport.
    Align the midpoint Y value of the element's {{ SVGAttr("viewBox") }} with the midpoint Y value of the viewport.

- `xMidYMid`
  - : Forces uniform scaling.
    Align the midpoint X value of the element's {{ SVGAttr("viewBox") }} with the midpoint X value of the viewport.
    Align the midpoint Y value of the element's {{ SVGAttr("viewBox") }} with the midpoint Y value of the viewport. This is the default value.

- `xMaxYMid`
  - : Forces uniform scaling.
    Align the `<min-x>+<width>` of the element's {{ SVGAttr("viewBox") }} with the maximum X value of the viewport.
    Align the midpoint Y value of the element's {{ SVGAttr("viewBox") }} with the midpoint Y value of the viewport.

- `xMinYMax`
  - : Forces uniform scaling.
    Align the `<min-x>` of the element's {{ SVGAttr("viewBox") }} with the smallest X value of the viewport.
    Align the `<min-y>+<height>` of the element's {{ SVGAttr("viewBox") }} with the maximum Y value of the viewport.

- `xMidYMax`
  - : Forces uniform scaling.
    Align the midpoint X value of the element's {{ SVGAttr("viewBox") }} with the midpoint X value of the viewport.
    Align the `<min-y>+<height>` of the element's {{ SVGAttr("viewBox") }} with the maximum Y value of the viewport.

- `xMaxYMax`
  - : Forces uniform scaling.
    Align the `<min-x>+<width>` of the element's {{ SVGAttr("viewBox") }} with the maximum X value of the viewport.
    Align the `<min-y>+<height>` of the element's {{ SVGAttr("viewBox") }} with the maximum Y value of the viewport.

The following two keywords determine how the SVG should be scaled relative to the container's bounds. Specifying the `meet` or `slice` reference is optional and, if provided, it must be one only one of two keywords. `meet` is the default value.

- `meet`
  - : Scales the graphic such that:
    - The aspect ratio is preserved.
    - The entire {{ SVGAttr("viewBox") }} is visible within the viewport.
    - The {{ SVGAttr("viewBox") }} is scaled up as much as possible, while still meeting the other criteria.

    In this case, if the aspect ratio of the graphic does not match the viewport, some of the viewport will extend beyond the bounds of the {{ SVGAttr("viewBox") }} (i.e., the area into which the {{ SVGAttr("viewBox") }} will draw will be smaller than the viewport).

- `slice`
  - : Scales the graphic such that:
    - The aspect ratio is preserved.
    - The entire viewport is covered by the {{ SVGAttr("viewBox") }}.
    - The {{ SVGAttr("viewBox") }} is scaled down as much as possible, while still meeting the other criteria.

    In this case, if the aspect ratio of the {{ SVGAttr("viewBox") }} does not match the viewport, some of the {{ SVGAttr("viewBox") }} will extend beyond the bounds of the viewport (i.e., the area into which the {{ SVGAttr("viewBox") }} will draw is larger than the viewport).

## Examples

# primitiveUnits

The **`primitiveUnits`** attribute specifies the coordinate system for the various length values within the filter primitives and for the attributes that define the filter primitive subregion.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("filter")}}

## Usage notes

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td><code>userSpaceOnUse</code> | <code>objectBoundingBox</code></td>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

- userSpaceOnUse
  - : This value indicates that any length values within the filter definitions represent values in the current user coordinate system in place at the time when the {{SVGElement("filter")}} element is referenced (i.e., the user coordinate system for the element referencing the {{SVGElement("filter")}} element via a {{SVGAttr("filter")}} attribute).
- objectBoundingBox
  - : This value indicates that any length values within the filter definitions represent fractions or percentages of the bounding box on the referencing element.

## radialGradient

For {{ SVGElement("radialGradient") }}, `r` defines the radius of the end circle for the radial gradient.

The gradient will be drawn such that the **100%** gradient stop is mapped to the perimeter of this end circle. A value of lower or equal to zero will cause the area to be painted as a single color using the color and opacity of the last gradient {{ SVGElement("stop") }}.

# radius

The **`radius`** attribute represents the radius (or radii) for the operation on a given {{SVGElement("feMorphology")}} filter primitive.

If two numbers are provided, the first number represents the x-radius and the second one the y-radius. If one number is provided, then that value is used for both x and y. The values are in the coordinate system established by the {{SVGAttr("primitiveUnits")}} attribute on the {{SVGElement("filter")}} element.

A negative or zero value disables the effect of the given filter primitive (i.e., the result is the filter input image).

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("feMorphology")}}

- {{SVGElement("symbol")}}

## marker

For {{SVGElement("marker")}}, `refX` defines the x coordinate of the marker's reference point, which is to be placed exactly at the marker's position on the shape.

## symbol

For {{SVGElement("symbol")}}, `refX` defines the x coordinate of the symbol, which is defined by the cumulative effect of the {{SVGAttr("x")}} attribute and any transformations on the {{SVGElement("symbol")}} and its host {{SVGElement("use")}} element.

Unlike other positioning attributes, `refX` is interpreted as being in the coordinate system of the symbol contents, after application of the {{SVGAttr("viewBox")}} and {{SVGAttr("preserveAspectRatio")}} attributes. If the attribute is not specified, no horizontal adjustment is made, and the left side of the symbol's rectangular viewport region (regardless of the `viewBox` coordinate) is positioned at the x coordinate.

> [!NOTE]
> For backwards compatibility, the behavior when `refX` is not specified on a `<symbol>` element is different from when it is specified with a value of `0`, and therefore different from the behavior when an equivalent attribute is not specified on a {{SVGElement("marker")}} element.

# requiredFeatures

{{Deprecated_Header}}

The **`requiredFeatures`** attribute takes a list of feature strings, with the individual strings separated by white space. It determines whether or not all of the named features are supported by the browser; if all of them are supported, the attribute evaluates to `true` end the element is rendered; otherwise, the attribute evaluates to `false` and the current element and its children are skipped and thus will not be rendered. This provides a way to design SVG that gracefully falls back when features aren't available.

If the attribute is not present, then its implicit evaluated value is `true`. If a null string or empty string value is given to attribute `requiredFeatures`, the attribute is evaluate to `false`.

`requiredFeatures` is often used in conjunction with the {{SVGElement("switch")}} element. If `requiredFeatures` is used in other situations, it represents a simple switch on the given element whether to render the element or not.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("a")}}
- {{SVGElement("animate")}}
- {{SVGElement("animateMotion")}}
- {{SVGElement("animateTransform")}}
- {{SVGElement("circle")}}
- {{SVGElement("clipPath")}}

## Feature strings

The following are the feature strings for the `requiredFeatures` attribute. These same feature strings apply to the [`hasFeature`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMImplementation/hasFeature) method call that is part of the SVG DOM's support for the {{domxref("DOMImplementation")}} interface. In some cases the feature strings map directly to a set of attributes, properties or elements, in others they represent some functionality of the browser. Note that the format and naming for feature strings changed from SVG 1.0 to SVG 1.1. The SVG 1.0 feature strings are not listed here; some browser support SVG 1.0 feature strings for compatibility reasons. However, the SVG 1.0 feature strings are considered deprecated.

</table>

- `always`
  - : This value indicates that the animation can be restarted at any time.
- `whenNotActive`
  - : This value indicates that the animation can only be restarted when it is not active (i.e., after the active end). Attempts to restart the animation during its active duration are ignored.
- `never`
  - : This value indicates that the animation cannot be restarted.

# result

The **`result`** attribute defines the assigned name for this filter primitive. If supplied, then graphics that result from processing this filter primitive can be referenced by an {{SVGAttr("in")}} attribute on a subsequent filter primitive within the same {{SVGElement("filter")}} element. If no value is provided, the output will only be available for re-use as the implicit input into the next filter primitive if that filter primitive provides no value for its `in` attribute.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("feBlend")}}
- {{SVGElement("feColorMatrix")}}
- {{SVGElement("feComponentTransfer")}}
- {{SVGElement("feComposite")}}
- {{SVGElement("feConvolveMatrix")}}
- {{SVGElement("feDiffuseLighting")}}
- {{SVGElement("feDisplacementMap")}}
- {{SVGElement("feDropShadow")}}
- {{SVGElement("feFlood")}}
- {{SVGElement("feGaussianBlur")}}
- {{SVGElement("feImage")}}
- {{SVGElement("feMerge")}}
- {{SVGElement("feMorphology")}}
- {{SVGElement("feOffset")}}
- {{SVGElement("feSpecularLighting")}}
- {{SVGElement("feTile")}}
- {{SVGElement("feTurbulence")}}

svg {
  height: 100%;
}
```

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 220 220" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">

</table>

- `<filter-primitive-reference>`
  - : This value is a {{cssxref("custom-ident")}} and defines the name for the filter primitive. It is only meaningful within a given {{SVGElement("filter")}} element and thus has only local scope. It is legal for the same `<filter-primitive-reference>` to appear multiple times within the same `<filter>` element. When referenced, this value will use the closest preceding filter primitive with the given result.

# rotate

The `rotate` attribute specifies how the animated element rotates as it travels along a path specified in an {{SVGElement("animateMotion")}} element.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("animateMotion")}}

## Usage notes

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td>
        <code>auto</code> | <code>auto-reverse</code> |
        {{cssxref("number")}}
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Default value</th>
      <td><code>0</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Animatable</th>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The `auto` and `auto-reverse` values allow the animated element's rotation to change dynamically as it travels along the path. If the value of `rotate` is `auto`, the element turns to align its right-hand side in the current direction of motion. If the value is `auto-reverse`, it turns its left-hand side in the current direction of motion.

Setting `rotate`'s value to a number specifies a constant rotation, in degrees, that does not change with the animation. The default value of `0` keeps the animated element in its original orientation.

</svg>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Example", '100%', 200)}}

## ellipse

For {{SVGElement('ellipse')}}, `rx` defines the x-radius of the shape. With a value lower or equal to zero the ellipse won't be drawn at all.

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td>
        <strong
          ><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Guides/Content_type#length"

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Animatable</th>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

> [!NOTE]
> The x-radius of the `<ellipse>` can also be defined with the {{cssxref("rx")}} _geometry property_. If set in CSS, the `rx` property value overrides the `rx` attribute value.

## rect

For {{SVGElement('rect')}}, `rx` defines the x-axis radius of the ellipse used to round off the corners of the rectangle.

The way the value of the `rx` attribute is interpreted depend on both the {{SVGAttr("ry")}} attribute and the width of the rectangle:

- If a properly specified value is provided for `rx` but not for {{SVGAttr("ry")}} (or the opposite), then the browser will consider the missing value equal to the defined one.
- If neither `rx` nor {{SVGAttr("ry")}} has a properly specified value, then the browser will draw a rectangle with square corners.
- If `rx` is greater than half of the width of the rectangle, then the browser will consider the value for `rx` as half of the width of the rectangle.

    <tr>

## ellipse

For {{SVGElement('ellipse')}}, `ry` defines the y-radius of the shape. With a value lower or equal to zero the ellipse won't be drawn at all.

> [!NOTE]
> The y-radius of the `<ellipse>` can also be defined with the {{cssxref("ry")}} _geometry property_. If set in CSS, the `ry` property value overrides the `ry` attribute value.

## rect

For {{SVGElement('rect')}}, `ry` defines the y-axis radius of the ellipse used to round off the corners of the rectangle.

The way the value of the `ry` attribute is interpreted depend on both the {{SVGAttr("rx")}} attribute and the width of the rectangle:

- If a properly specified value is provided for `ry` but not for {{SVGAttr("rx")}} (or the opposite), then the browser will consider the missing value equal to the defined one.
- If neither `ry` nor {{SVGAttr("rx")}} has a properly specified value, then the browser will draw a rectangle with square corners.
- If `ry` is greater than half of the width of the rectangle, then the browser will consider the value for `ry` as half of the width of the rectangle.

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>

  </tbody>
</table>

- `optimizeSpeed`
  - : This value indicates that the user agent shall emphasize rendering speed over geometric precision and crisp edges. This option will sometimes cause the user agent to turn off shape anti-aliasing.
- `crispEdges`
  - : This value indicates that the user agent shall attempt to emphasize the contrast between clean edges of artwork over rendering speed and geometric precision. To achieve crisp edges, the user agent might turn off anti-aliasing for all lines and curves or possibly just for straight lines which are close to vertical or horizontal. Also, the user agent might adjust line positions and line widths to align edges with device pixels.

# slope

The **`slope`** attribute defines the values for linear filters, such as brightness.

The `slope` attribute is supported by children of the {{SVGElement("feComponentTransfer")}} filter primitive, including the `feFunc-RGBA` transfer functions. When the `type` of a transfer function is `linear`, the `slope` defines the slope of the linear function.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG component transfer function elements when `type="linear"` is set:

- {{SVGElement("feFuncR")}}
- {{SVGElement("feFuncG")}}
- {{SVGElement("feFuncB")}}
- {{SVGElement("feFuncA")}}

> [!NOTE]
> Originally, the `slope` attribute was used within `<font-face>` to indicate the vertical stroke angle of a font. This use case has been deprecated.

- `pad`
  - : This value indicates that the final color of the gradient fills the shape beyond the gradient's edges.
- `reflect`
  - : This value indicates that the gradient repeats in reverse beyond its edges.
- `repeat`
  - : This value specifies that the gradient repeats in the original order beyond its edges.

### Defining a gradient's edges

By default, a gradient reaches to the edges of the shape being filled. To see the effects of this attribute, you will need to set the size of the gradient smaller than the shape.

In the case of a linear gradient, the edges may be defined as a rectangle by the `x1`, `x2`, `y1` and `y2` attributes. In the case of a radial gradient, the edges may be defined as outer and inner circles by the `cx`, `cy` and `r` (outer) and `fx`, `fy` and `fr` (inner) attributes.

- `<length-percentage>`
  - : A length represents a distance along the path measured in the current user coordinate system for the {{SVGElement("textPath")}} element.

    If a percentage is given, then the start offset represents a percentage distance along the entire path. Thus, `0%` indicates the start point of the path and `100%` indicates the end point of the path.

- `<number>`
  - : This value indicates a distance along the path measured in the current user coordinate system for the `<textPath>` element.

> [!NOTE]
> Negative values and values larger than the path length (e.g., `150%`) are allowed.

# stop-color

The **`stop-color`** attribute indicates what color to use at a gradient stop.

> [!NOTE]
> With respect to gradients, SVG treats the `transparent` keyword differently than CSS. SVG does not calculate gradients in pre-multiplied space, so `transparent` really means transparent black. So, specifying a `stop-color` with the value `transparent` is equivalent to specifying a `stop-color` with the value `black` and a {{SVGAttr("stop-opacity")}} with the value `0`.

> [!NOTE]
> As a presentation attribute, `stop-color` also has a CSS property counterpart: {{cssxref("stop-color")}}. When both are specified, the CSS property takes priority.

### miter-clip

> [!NOTE]
> The `miter-clip` value isn't widely supported yet.

The `miter-clip` value indicates that a sharp corner is to be used to join path segments. The corner is formed by extending the outer edges of the stroke at the tangents of the path segments until they intersect.

If the {{SVGAttr('stroke-miterlimit')}} is exceeded, the miter is clipped at a distance equal to half the {{SVGAttr('stroke-miterlimit')}} value multiplied by the stroke width from the intersection of the path segments. This provides a better rendering than `miter` on very sharp join or in case of an animation.

When two line segments meet at a sharp angle and `miter` joins have been specified for {{ SVGAttr("stroke-linejoin") }}, it is possible for the miter to extend far beyond the thickness of the line stroking the path. The `stroke-miterlimit` ratio is used to define when the limit is exceeded, if so the join is converted from a miter to a bevel.

The ratio of miter length (distance between the outer tip and the inner corner of the miter) to {{ SVGAttr("stroke-width") }} is directly related to the angle (theta) between the segments in user space by the formula:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<math display="block">
  <semantics><mstyle displaystyle="true"><mi>stroke-miterlimit</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>miterLength</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>stroke-width</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>sin</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mrow><mo>θ</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mfrac></mstyle><annotation encoding="TeX">\text{stroke-miterlimit} = \frac{\text{miterLength}}{\text{stroke-width}} = \frac{1}{\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}</annotation></semantics>
</math>
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

For example, a miter limit of 1.414 converts miters to bevels for theta less than 90 degrees, a limit of 4.0 converts them for theta less than approximately 29 degrees, and a limit of 10.0 converts them for theta less than approximately 11.5 degrees.

It's important to know that the stroke partially covers the fill of a shape, so a stroke with an opacity different than `1` will partially show the fill underneath. To avoid this effect, it is possible to apply a global opacity with the {{SVGAttr('opacity')}} attribute or to put the stroke behind the fill with the {{SVGAttr('paint-order')}} attribute.

- CSS {{cssxref("stroke-width")}} property
# stroke

The **`stroke`** attribute is a presentation attribute defining the color (_or any SVG paint servers like gradients or patterns_) used to paint the outline of the shape.

> [!NOTE]
> As a presentation attribute, `stroke` also has a CSS property counterpart: {{cssxref("stroke")}}. When both are specified, the CSS property takes priority.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement('circle')}}
- {{SVGElement('ellipse')}}
- {{SVGElement('line')}}
- {{SVGElement('path')}}
- {{SVGElement('polygon')}}
- {{SVGElement('polyline')}}
- {{SVGElement('rect')}}
- {{SVGElement('text')}}
- {{SVGElement('textPath')}}
- {{SVGElement('tspan')}}

## Examples

### Basic color and gradient stroke

```css hidden
html,
body,
svg {
  height: 100%;
}
```

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 20 10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <!-- Basic color stroke -->
  <circle cx="5" cy="5" r="4" fill="none" stroke="green" />

  <!-- Stroke a circle with a gradient -->
  <defs>
    <linearGradient id="myGradient">
      <stop offset="0%" stop-color="green" />
      <stop offset="100%" stop-color="white" />
    </linearGradient>
  </defs>

  <circle cx="15" cy="5" r="4" fill="none" stroke="url(#myGradient)" />
</svg>
```

The output is as follows:

{{EmbedLiveSample("Basic color and gradient stroke", '100%', 200)}}

### `context-stroke` example

In this example, we define three shapes using {{SVGElement('path')}} elements, each with a different `stroke` and [`fill`](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/fill) color set on them. We also define a {{SVGElement('circle')}} element as a marker via the {{SVGElement('marker')}} element. Each shape has the marker applied via the `marker` CSS property.

The {{SVGElement('circle')}} has `stroke="context-stroke"` and `fill="context-fill"` set on it. Because it is being set as a marker in the context of the shapes, these attributes cause it to inherit the `fill` and `stroke` set on the {{SVGElement('path')}} element in each case.

```html-nolint
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 300 90">
  <style>
    path {
      stroke-width: 2px;
      marker: url("#circle");
    }
  </style>
  <path d="M 10 44.64 L 30 10 L 70 10 L 90 44.64 L 70 79.28 L 30 79.28 Z"
        stroke="red" fill="orange" />
  <path d="M 100 44.64 L 80 10 L 120 10 L 140 44.64 L 120 79.28 L 80 79.28 Z"
        stroke="green" fill="lightgreen" />
  <path d="M 150 44.64 L 130 10 L 170 10 L 190 44.64 L 170 79.28 L 130 79.28 Z"
        stroke="blue" fill="lightblue" />
  <marker id="circle" markerWidth="12" markerHeight="12"
          refX="6" refY="6" markerUnits="userSpaceOnUse">
    <circle cx="6" cy="6" r="3" stroke-width="2"
            stroke="context-stroke" fill="context-fill"  />
  </marker>
</svg>
```

The output is as follows:

{{EmbedLiveSample("`context-stroke` example", '100%', 220)}}

> [!NOTE]
> Elements can also use `context-stroke` and `context-fill` to inherit `stroke` and `fill` values when they are referenced by {{SVGElement('use')}} elements.

- `<language-tags>`
  - : The value is a set of comma-separated tokens, each of which must be a valid {{glossary("BCP 47 language tag")}}.

`systemLanguage` is often used in conjunction with the {{SVGElement("switch")}} element. If the attribute is used in other situations, then it represents a simple switch on the given element whether to render the element or not.

> [!NOTE]
> If several alternative language objects are enclosed in a `<switch>` and none of them matches, this may lead to situations where no content is displayed. It is thus recommended to include a "catch-all" choice at the end of such a `<switch>` which is acceptable in all cases.

The attribute evaluates to "true" if one of the language tags indicated by user preferences is a case-insensitive match or prefix (followed by a "-") of one of the language tags given in the value of this parameter. Otherwise it evaluates to "false".

> [!NOTE]
> The prefix matching rule does not imply that if a user understands a language with a certain tag, that the user will also understand all languages with the tag as prefix.

If the attribute is not present, then it implicitly evaluates to "true". If a null string or empty string value is given, the attribute evaluates to "false".

The prefix rule allows the use of prefix tags if this is the case.

Multiple languages may be listed for content that is intended for multiple audiences. For example, content that is presented simultaneously in the original Maori and English versions, would call for:

```html
<text systemLanguage="mi, en"><!-- content goes here --></text>
```

However, just because multiple languages are present within the object on which the `systemLanguage` test attribute is placed, this does not mean that it is intended for multiple linguistic audiences. An example would be a beginner's language primer, such as "A First Lesson in Latin," which is clearly intended to be used by an English-literate audience. In this case, the attribute should only include `en`.

# text-anchor

The **`text-anchor`** attribute is used to align (start-, middle- or end-alignment) a string of pre-formatted text or auto-wrapped text where the wrapping area is determined from the {{cssxref("inline-size")}} property relative to a given point.

This attribute is not applicable to other types of auto-wrapped text. For those cases you should use {{cssxref("text-align")}}. For multi-line text, the alignment takes place for each line.

The `text-anchor` attribute is applied to each individual text chunk within a given {{SVGElement("text")}} element. Each text chunk has an initial current text position, which represents the point in the user coordinate system resulting from (depending on context) application of the {{SVGAttr("x")}} and {{SVGAttr("y")}} attributes on the `<text>` element, any `x` or `y` attribute values on a {{SVGElement("tspan")}} element assigned explicitly to the first rendered character in a text chunk, or determination of the initial current text position for a {{SVGElement("textPath")}} element.

> [!NOTE]
> As a presentation attribute, `text-anchor` also has a CSS property counterpart: {{cssxref("text-anchor")}}. When both are specified, the CSS property takes priority.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("text")}}
- {{SVGElement("textPath")}}
- {{SVGElement("tspan")}}

- `start`
  - : The rendered characters are aligned such that the start of the text string is at the initial current text position. For an element with a {{cssxref("direction")}} property value of `ltr` (typical for most European languages), the left side of the text is rendered at the initial text position. For an element with a direction property value of `rtl` (typical for Arabic and Hebrew), the right side of the text is rendered at the initial text position. For an element with a vertical primary text direction (often typical for Asian text), the top side of the text is rendered at the initial text position.
- `middle`
  - : The rendered characters are aligned such that the middle of the text string is at the current text position. (For text on a path, conceptually the text string is first laid out in a straight line. The midpoint between the start of the text string and the end of the text string is determined. Then, the text string is mapped onto the path with this midpoint placed at the current text position.)
- `end`
  - : The rendered characters are shifted such that the end of the resulting rendered text (final current text position before applying the `text-anchor` property) is at the initial current text position. For an element with a `direction` property value of `ltr` (typical for most European languages), the right side of the text is rendered at the initial text position. For an element with a `direction` property value of `rtl` (typical for Arabic and Hebrew), the left side of the text is rendered at the initial text position. For an element with a vertical primary text direction (often typical for Asian text), the bottom of the text is rendered at the initial text position.

# text-decoration

The **`text-decoration`** attribute defines whether text is decorated with an underline, overline and/or strike-through. It is a shorthand for the {{cssxref("text-decoration-line")}} and {{cssxref("text-decoration-style")}} properties.

The fill and stroke of the text decoration are given by the fill and stroke of the text at the point where the text decoration is declared.

The paint order of the text decoration, i.e., the fill and stroke, is determined by the value of the {{SVGAttr("paint-order")}} attribute at the point where the text decoration is declared.

> [!NOTE]
> As a presentation attribute, `text-decoration` also has a CSS property counterpart: {{cssxref("text-decoration")}}. When both are specified, the CSS property takes priority.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("text")}}
- {{SVGElement("textPath")}}
- {{SVGElement("tspan")}}

- `optimizeSpeed`
  - : This value indicates that the user agent shall emphasize rendering speed over legibility and geometric precision. This option will sometimes cause some user agents to turn off text anti-aliasing.
- `optimizeLegibility`
  - : This value indicates that the user agent shall emphasize legibility over rendering speed and geometric precision. The user agent will often choose whether to apply anti-aliasing techniques, built-in font hinting or both to produce the most legible text.
- `geometricPrecision`
  - : This value indicates that the user agent shall emphasize geometric precision over legibility and rendering speed. This option will usually cause the user agent to suspend the use of hinting so that {{Glossary("glyph")}} outlines are drawn with comparable geometric precision to the rendering of path data.

# textLength

The **`textLength`** attribute, available on SVG {{SVGElement("text")}} and {{SVGElement("tspan")}} elements, lets you specify the width of the space into which the text will draw. The {{glossary("user agent")}} will ensure that the text does not extend farther than that distance, using the method or methods specified by the {{SVGAttr("lengthAdjust")}} attribute. By default, only the spacing between characters is adjusted, but the glyph size can also be adjusted if you change `lengthAdjust`.

By using `textLength`, you can ensure that your SVG text displays at the same width regardless of conditions including web fonts failing to load (or not having loaded yet).

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("text")}}
- {{SVGElement("textPath")}}
- {{SVGElement("tspan")}}

## Interactive example

This example presents text you can resize using an {{HTMLElement("input")}} element of type [`"range"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/range).

### CSS

```css
.controls {
  font:
    16px "Open Sans",
    "Arial",
    sans-serif;
}
```

### SVG

Let's start with the SVG. It's pretty basic, with a 1000-by-300 pixel space mapped into a 10 centimeter by 3 centimeter box.

```html
<svg
  width="10cm"
  height="3cm"
  viewBox="0 0 1000 300"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect
    x="1"
    y="1"
    width="998"
    height="298"
    fill="none"
    stroke="green"
    stroke-width="2" />

  <text
    id="hello"
    x="10"
    y="150"
    font-family="sans-serif"
    font-size="60"
    fill="green">
    Hello world!
  </text>
</svg>
```

First, a {{SVGElement("rect")}} element is used to create and stroke a rectangle to contain the text. Then {{SVGElement("text")}} is used to create the text element itself, with an {{SVGAttr("id")}} of `"hello"`.

### HTML

The HTML includes two displayed elements contained inside a grouping {{HTMLElement("div")}}:

```html
<div class="controls">
  <input type="range" id="widthSlider" min="80" max="978" />
  <span id="widthDisplay"></span>
</div>
```

The {{HTMLElement("input")}} element, of type `"range"`, is used to create the slider control the user will manipulate to change the width of the text. A {{HTMLElement("span")}} element of ID `"widthDisplay"` is provided to display the current width value.

### JavaScript

Finally, let's have a look at the JavaScript code. It starts by stashing references to the elements it will need to access, using {{domxref("Document.getElementById()")}}:

```js
const widthSlider = document.getElementById("widthSlider");
const widthDisplay = document.getElementById("widthDisplay");
const textElement = document.getElementById("hello");
const baseLength = Math.floor(textElement.textLength.baseVal.value);

widthSlider.value = baseLength;

widthSlider.addEventListener("input", (event) => {
  textElement.textLength.baseVal.newValueSpecifiedUnits(
    SVGLength.SVG_LENGTHTYPE_PX,
    widthSlider.valueAsNumber,
  );
  widthDisplay.innerText = widthSlider.value;
});

widthSlider.dispatchEvent(new Event("input"));
```

After fetching the element references, an {{domxref("EventTarget.addEventListener", "event listener", "", 1)}} is established by calling {{domxref("EventTarget.addEventListener", "addEventListener()")}} on the slider control, to receive any {{domxref("Element/input_event", "input")}} events which occur. These events will be sent any time the slider's value changes, even if the user hasn't stopped moving it, so we can responsively adjust the text width.

When an `"input"` event occurs, we call `newValueSpecifiedUnits()` to set the value of `textLength` to the slider's new value, using the `SVGLength` interface's `SVG_LENGTHTYPE_PX` unit type to indicate that the value represents pixels. Note that we have to dive into `textLength` to get its `baseVal` property; `textLength` is stored as an {{domxref("SVGLength")}} object, so we can't treat it like a plain number.

After updating the text width, the contents of the `widthDisplay` box are updated with the new value as well, and we're finished.

### Result

Here's what the example looks like. Try dragging the slider around to get a feel for what it does.

# to

The **`to`** attribute indicates the final value of the attribute that will be modified during the animation.

The value of the attribute will change between the {{SVGAttr("from")}} attribute value and this value.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("animate")}}
- {{SVGElement("animateMotion")}}
- {{SVGElement("animateTransform")}}
- {{SVGElement("set")}}

## Example

```css hidden
html,
body,
svg {
  height: 100%;
}
```

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect x="10" y="10" width="100" height="100">
    <animate
      attributeType="XML"
      attributeName="width"
      fill="freeze"
      from="100"
      to="150"
      dur="3s" />
  </rect>
</svg>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Example", "200", "200")}}

## animate, animateMotion, animateTransform

For {{SVGElement("animate")}}, {{SVGElement("animateMotion")}}, and {{SVGElement("animateTransform")}}, `to` specifies the ending value of the animation.

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td><code>&#x3C;value></code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Default value</th>
      <td><em>None</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Animatable</th>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The exact value type for this attribute depend on the value of the attribute that will be animated.

If a list of values is defined via the {{SVGAttr("values")}} attribute, the `to` attribute is ignored.

## set

For the {{SVGElement("set")}} element, `to` specifies the value for the attribute during the duration of the element.

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td><code>&#x3C;value></code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Default value</th>
      <td><em>None</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Animatable</th>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

# transform-origin

The **`transform-origin`** SVG attribute sets the origin for an item's transformations.

You can use this attribute with any SVG element.

> [!NOTE]
> As a presentation attribute, `transform-origin` also has a CSS property counterpart: {{cssxref("transform-origin")}}. When both are specified, the CSS property takes priority.

## Usage notes

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Values</strong></td>
      <td>See {{cssxref("transform-origin", "", "#formal_syntax")}}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Default value</strong></td>
      <td><code>0 0</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Animatable</strong></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

> [!NOTE]
> The default value of `transform-origin` is `0 0` for all SVG elements except for root `<svg>` elements and `<svg>` elements that are a direct child of a [`foreignObject`](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/foreignObject). These elements have `transform-origin: 50% 50%`, as in normal CSS.

Specified lengths, percentages, and keywords (`left`, `center`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom`) are all relative to the [reference box](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-box). Because the default value for `transform-box` is `view-box`, the transform origin coordinates are relative to the `viewBox` of the SVG element, unless the element itself has an associated CSS layout box.

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate the rotation of a rectangular box 30° around a number of different `transform-origin`s.
The SVG is declared in each case with the original box drawn with a dashed red outline, followed by the rotated box drawn in lime, and then the `transform-origin` drawn as a red crosshair marker.

### Default transform-origin

By default, `transform-origin` has a value of `0 0`, which places it at the origin of the `viewBox`. Below, we extend the `viewBox` to negative values, so you can see the full crosshair marker, and also note that it may not always be the top-left corner of the `<svg>` element.

```html
<svg
  viewBox="-10 -10 300 300"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  width="310"
  height="310">
  <rect
    x="60"
    y="10"
    width="180"
    height="180"
    fill="none"
    stroke="red"
    stroke-width="3"
    stroke-dasharray="3 3" />
  <rect
    x="60"
    y="10"
    width="180"
    height="180"
    fill="lime"
    opacity="0.5"
    transform="rotate(30)" />
  <g transform="translate(0 0)">
    <circle cx="0" cy="0" r="3" fill="red" opacity="0.5" />
    <path d="M -8 0 h 16 m -8 -8 v 16" fill="none" stroke="red" />
    <circle cx="0" cy="0" r="6" fill="none" stroke="red" />
  </g>
</svg>
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('default_transform-origin', 400, 310) }}

### Center transform-origin

Below, we set `transform-origin` to `center`, which places the origin at the center of the `viewBox`, but not the center of the element that's being transformed.

```html
<svg
  viewBox="-10 -10 300 300"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  width="310"
  height="310">
  <rect
    x="60"
    y="10"
    width="180"
    height="180"
    fill="none"
    stroke="red"
    stroke-width="3"
    stroke-dasharray="3 3" />
  <rect
    x="60"
    y="10"
    width="180"
    height="180"
    fill="lime"
    opacity="0.5"
    transform="rotate(30)"
    transform-origin="center" />
  <g transform="translate(150 150)">
    <circle cx="0" cy="0" r="3" fill="red" opacity="0.5" />
    <path d="M -8 0 h 16 m -8 -8 v 16" fill="none" stroke="red" />
    <circle cx="0" cy="0" r="6" fill="none" stroke="red" />
  </g>
</svg>
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('center_transform-origin', 400, 310) }}

### transform-origin relative to the transformed element

To make `transform-origin` relative to the transformed element, you can use the `transform-box` property. Below, we set `transform-box` to `fill-box`, which makes the `transform-origin` relative to the bounding box of the element being transformed.

```html
<svg
  viewBox="-10 -10 300 300"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"

    height="180"
    fill="none"
    stroke="red"
    stroke-width="3"
    stroke-dasharray="3 3" />
  <rect
    class="transformed-elem"
    x="60"
    y="10"
    width="180"
    height="180"
    fill="lime"
    opacity="0.5"
    transform="rotate(30)"
    transform-origin="center" />
  <g transform="translate(150 100)">
    <circle cx="0" cy="0" r="3" fill="red" opacity="0.5" />
    <path d="M -8 0 h 16 m -8 -8 v 16" fill="none" stroke="red" />
    <circle cx="0" cy="0" r="6" fill="none" stroke="red" />
  </g>

# transform

The **`transform`** attribute defines a list of transform definitions that are applied to an element and the element's children.

> [!NOTE]
> As a presentation attribute, `transform` also has a CSS property counterpart: {{cssxref("transform")}}. When both are specified, the CSS property takes priority. Note that there are some differences in syntax between the CSS property and the attribute!

## Elements

In SVG 2, you can use the `transform` attribute on any element, including the {{SVGElement('svg')}} root.
Note that using `transform` on the `<svg>` root is a newer feature, and you should check [browser compatibility](#browser_compatibility) for support.
Using `transform` on the `<svg>` root is convenient for applying transforms to an entire SVG image without the need for extra wrapper elements or CSS workarounds.

In SVG 1.1, only these 16 elements were allowed to have a `transform` applied: {{SVGElement('a')}}, {{SVGElement('circle')}}, {{SVGElement('clipPath')}}, {{SVGElement('defs')}}, {{SVGElement('ellipse')}}, {{SVGElement('foreignObject')}}, {{SVGElement('g')}}, {{SVGElement('image')}}, {{SVGElement('line')}}, {{SVGElement('path')}}, {{SVGElement('polygon')}}, {{SVGElement('polyline')}}, {{SVGElement('rect')}}, {{SVGElement('switch')}}, {{SVGElement('text')}}, and {{SVGElement('use')}}.

Also, as a legacy from SVG 1.1, {{SVGElement('linearGradient')}} and {{SVGElement('radialGradient')}} support the `gradientTransform` attribute, and {{SVGElement('pattern')}} supports the `patternTransform` attribute, both of which behave exactly like the `transform` attribute.

### Apply a transform to an entire SVG document

In this example, we apply a `transform` to the {{svgelement("svg")}} root element, meaning that the transform is applied to the entire SVG document:

```html live-sample___transform-svg-document
<svg
  viewBox="-40 0 150 100"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
  transform="rotate(-10 50 100)
               translate(-36 15.5)
               skewX(40)
               scale(1 0.5)">
  <g fill="grey">
    <path
      id="heart"
      d="M 10,30 A 20,20 0,0,1 50,30 A 20,20 0,0,1 90,30 Q 90,60 50,90 Q 10,60 10,30 z" />
  </g>

  <use href="#heart" fill="none" stroke="red" />
</svg>
```

## Transform functions

The following transform functions can be used by the `transform` attribute `<transform-list>`.

> [!WARNING]
> As per the spec, you should be able to also use CSS [transform functions](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function). However, the compatibility isn't guaranteed.

### Matrix

The `matrix(<a> <b> <c> <d> <e> <f>)` transform function specifies a transformation in the form of a transformation matrix of six values. `matrix(a,b,c,d,e,f)` is equivalent to applying the transformation matrix:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

#### Example

```css hidden
html,
body,
svg {
  height: 100%;
}
```

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect x="10" y="10" width="30" height="20" fill="green" />

  <!--
  In the following example we are applying the matrix:
  [a c e]    [3 -1 30]
  [b d f] => [1  3 40]
  [0 0 1]    [0  0  1]

  which transform the rectangle as such:

  top left corner: oldX=10 oldY=10
  newX = a * oldX + c * oldY + e = 3 * 10 - 1 * 10 + 30 = 50
  newY = b * oldX + d * oldY + f = 1 * 10 + 3 * 10 + 40 = 80

  top right corner: oldX=40 oldY=10
  newX = a * oldX + c * oldY + e = 3 * 40 - 1 * 10 + 30 = 140
  newY = b * oldX + d * oldY + f = 1 * 40 + 3 * 10 + 40 = 110

  newX = a * oldX + c * oldY + e = 3 * 40 - 1 * 30 + 30 = 120
  newY = b * oldX + d * oldY + f = 1 * 40 + 3 * 30 + 40 = 170
  -->
  <rect
    x="10"
    y="10"
    width="30"
    height="20"
    fill="red"
    transform="matrix(3 1 -1 3 30 40)" />
</svg>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Matrix', '100%', 200)}}

### Translate

The `translate(<x> [<y>])` transform function moves the object by `x` and `y`. If `y` is not provided, it is assumed to be `0`.

In other words:

```plain
xNew = xOld + <x>
yNew = yOld + <y>
```

#### Example

```css hidden
html,
body,
svg {
  height: 100%;
}
```

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <!-- No translation -->
  <rect x="5" y="5" width="40" height="40" fill="green" />

  <!-- Horizontal translation -->
  <rect
    x="5"
    y="5"
    width="40"
    height="40"
    fill="blue"
    transform="translate(50)" />

  <!-- Vertical translation -->
  <rect
    x="5"
    y="5"
    width="40"
    height="40"
    fill="red"
    transform="translate(0 50)" />

  <!-- Both horizontal and vertical translation -->
  <rect
    x="5"
    y="5"
    width="40"
    height="40"
    fill="yellow"
    transform="translate(50 50)" />
</svg>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Example_3', '100%', 200)}}

### Scale

The `scale(<x> [<y>])` transform function specifies a scale operation by `x` and `y`. If `y` is not provided, it is assumed to be equal to `x`.

#### Example

```css hidden
html,
body,
svg {
  height: 100%;
}
```

```html
<svg viewBox="-50 -50 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <!-- uniform scale -->
  <circle cx="0" cy="0" r="10" fill="red" transform="scale(4)" />

  <!-- vertical scale -->
  <circle cx="0" cy="0" r="10" fill="yellow" transform="scale(1, 4)" />

  <!-- horizontal scale -->
  <circle cx="0" cy="0" r="10" fill="pink" transform="scale(4, 1)" />

  <!-- No scale -->
  <circle cx="0" cy="0" r="10" fill="black" />
</svg>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Scale', '100%', 200)}}

### Rotate

The `rotate(<a> [<x> <y>])` transform function specifies a rotation by `a` degrees about a given point. If optional parameters `x` and `y` are not supplied, the rotation is about the origin of the current user coordinate system. If optional parameters `x` and `y` are supplied, the rotation is about the point `(x, y)`.

#### Example

```css hidden
html,
body,
svg {
  height: 100%;
}
```

```html
<svg viewBox="-12 -2 34 14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect x="0" y="0" width="10" height="10" />

  <!-- rotation is done around the point 0,0 -->
  <rect x="0" y="0" width="10" height="10" fill="red" transform="rotate(100)" />

  <!-- rotation is done around the point 10,10 -->
  <rect
    x="0"
    y="0"
    width="10"
    height="10"
    fill="green"
    transform="rotate(100, 10, 10)" />
</svg>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Rotate', '100%', 200)}}

### SkewX

The `skewX(<a>)` transform function specifies a skew transformation along the x axis by `a` degrees.

#### Example

```css hidden
html,
body,
svg {
  height: 100%;
}
```

```html
<svg viewBox="-5 -5 10 10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect x="-3" y="-3" width="6" height="6" />

  <rect x="-3" y="-3" width="6" height="6" fill="red" transform="skewX(30)" />
</svg>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('SkewX', '100%', 200)}}

### SkewY

The `skewY(<a>)` transform function specifies a skew transformation along the y axis by `a` degrees.

#### Example

```css hidden
html,
body,
svg {
  height: 100%;
}
```

```html
<svg viewBox="-5 -5 10 10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect x="-3" y="-3" width="6" height="6" />

  <rect x="-3" y="-3" width="6" height="6" fill="red" transform="skewY(30)" />

# type

The `type` attribute is a generic attribute and it has different meaning based on the context in which it's used.

- For the {{SVGElement("animateTransform")}} element, it defines the type of transformation, whose values change over time.
- For the {{SVGElement("feColorMatrix")}} element, it indicates the type of matrix operation. The keyword `matrix` indicates that a full 5x4 matrix of values will be provided. The other keywords represent convenience shortcuts to allow commonly used color operations to be performed without specifying a complete matrix.
- For the {{SVGElement("feFuncR")}}, {{SVGElement("feFuncG")}}, {{SVGElement("feFuncB")}}, and {{SVGElement("feFuncA")}} elements, it Indicates the type of component transfer function.
- For the {{SVGElement("feTurbulence")}} element, it indicates whether the filter primitive should perform a noise or turbulence function.
- For the {{SVGElement("style")}} and {{SVGElement("script")}} elements, it defines the content type of the element.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("animateTransform")}}
- {{SVGElement("feColorMatrix")}}
- {{SVGElement("feFuncA")}}
- {{SVGElement("feFuncB")}}
- {{SVGElement("feFuncG")}}
- {{SVGElement("feFuncR")}}

# values

The `values` attribute has different meanings, depending upon the context where it's used, either it defines a sequence of values used over the course of an animation, or it's a list of numbers for a color matrix, which is interpreted differently depending on the type of color change to be performed.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("animate")}}
- {{SVGElement("animateMotion")}}
- {{SVGElement("animateTransform")}}
- {{SVGElement("feColorMatrix")}}

## animate, animateMotion, animateTransform

For {{SVGElement("animate")}}, {{SVGElement("animateMotion")}}, and {{SVGElement("animateTransform")}}, `values` is a list of values defining the sequence of values over the course of the animation. If this attribute is specified, any {{SVGAttr("from")}}, {{SVGAttr("to")}}, and {{SVGAttr("by")}} attribute values set on the element are ignored.

Normally stroking involves calculating stroke outline of the shape's path in current user coordinate system and filling that outline with the stroke paint (color or gradient). The resulting visual effect of this value is that the stroke width is not dependent on the transformations of the element (including non-uniform scaling and shear transformations) and zoom level.

> [!NOTE]
> The spec defines three other values, `non-scaling-size`, `non-rotation`, and `fixed-position`, but these have no implementations and are considered at-risk.

## Examples

### Setting `vector-effect` as `non-scaling-stroke`

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 500 240">
  <!-- normal -->
  <path
    d="M10,20 L40,100 L39,200 z"
    stroke="black"
    stroke-width="2px"
    fill="none"></path>

  <!-- scaled -->
  <path
    transform="translate(100,0) scale(4,1)"
    d="M10,20 L40,100 L39,200 z"
    stroke="black"
    stroke-width="2px"
    fill="none"></path>

  <!-- fixed-->
  <path
    vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"
    transform="translate(300, 0) scale(4, 1)"
    d="M10,20 L40,100 L39,200 z"
    stroke="black"
    stroke-width="2px"

{{Deprecated_Header}}

The **`version`** attribute is used to indicate what specification a SVG document conforms to. It is only allowed on the root {{SVGElement("svg")}} element. It is purely advisory and has no influence on rendering or processing.

While it is specified to accept any number, the only two valid choices are currently `1.0` and `1.1`.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("svg")}}

```html
<svg version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect x="10" y="10" width="80" height="80" />

# viewBox

The **`viewBox`** attribute defines the position and dimension, in user space, of an SVG viewport.

The value of the `viewBox` attribute is a list of four numbers separated by whitespace and/or a comma: `min-x`, `min-y`, `width`, and `height`. `min-x` and `min-y` represent the smallest X and Y coordinates that the `viewBox` may have (the origin coordinates of the `viewBox`) and the `width` and `height` specify the `viewBox` size. The resulting `viewBox` is a rectangle in user space mapped to the bounds of the viewport of an SVG element (not the [browser viewport](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Viewport)).
When an SVG contains a `viewBox` attribute (often in combination with a [`preserveAspectRatio`](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/preserveAspectRatio) attribute), a transform stretches or resizes the SVG viewport to fit a particular container element.

## Elements

You can use this attribute with the SVG elements described in the sections below.

## Examples

```css hidden
html,
body,
svg {
  height: 100%;
  vertical-align: top;
}
svg:not(:root) {
  display: inline-block;
}
```

The code snippet below includes three {{SVGElement("svg")}}s with different `viewBox` attribute values and identical {{SVGElement("rect")}} and {{SVGElement("circle")}} descendants creating very different results. The size of `<rect>` is defined using relative units, so the visual size of the square produced looks unchanged regardless of the `viewBox` value. The radius length {{SVGAttr("r")}} attribute of the `<circle>` is the same in each case, but this user unit value is resolved against the size defined in the `viewBox`, producing different results in each case.

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect x="0" y="0" width="100%" height="100%" />
  <circle cx="50%" cy="50%" r="4" fill="white" />
</svg>

<svg viewBox="0 0 10 10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect x="0" y="0" width="100%" height="100%" />
  <circle cx="50%" cy="50%" r="4" fill="white" />
</svg>

<svg viewBox="-5 -5 10 10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect x="0" y="0" width="100%" height="100%" />
  <circle cx="50%" cy="50%" r="4" fill="white" />
</svg>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Examples", '100%', 200)}}

The user units of `r="4"` are resolved against the `viewBox` sizes, creating dramatically different circle sizes. The exact effect of the `viewBox` attribute is influenced by the {{ SVGAttr("preserveAspectRatio") }} attribute.

> [!NOTE]
> Values for `width` or `height` lower or equal to `0` disable rendering of the element.

## Specifications

# visibility

The **`visibility`** attribute lets you control the visibility of graphical elements. With a value of `hidden` or `collapse` the current graphics element is invisible.

> [!NOTE]
> If the `visibility` attribute is set to `hidden` on a text element, then the text is invisible but still takes up space in text layout calculations.

Depending on the value of attribute {{SVGAttr("pointer-events")}}, graphics elements which have their `visibility` attribute set to `hidden` still might receive events.

> [!NOTE]
> As a presentation attribute, `visibility` also has a CSS property counterpart: {{cssxref("visibility")}}. When both are specified, the CSS property takes priority.

## Elements

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("a")}}
- `<audio>`
- `<canvas>`
- {{SVGElement("circle")}}
- {{SVGElement("ellipse")}}
- {{SVGElement("foreignObject")}}
- `<iframe>`
- {{SVGElement("image")}}
- {{SVGElement("line")}}
- {{SVGElement("path")}}
- {{SVGElement("polygon")}}
- {{SVGElement("polyline")}}
- {{SVGElement("rect")}}
- {{SVGElement("text")}}
- {{SVGElement("textPath")}}
- {{SVGElement("tspan")}}
- `<video>`

## Usage notes

    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td>
        <code>visible</code> | <code>hidden</code> | <code>collapse</code>

- `visible`
  - : This value indicates that the element will be painted.
- `hidden`
  - : This value indicates that the element will not be painted. Though it is still part of the rendering tree, i.e., it may receive pointer events depending on the {{SVGAttr("pointer-events")}} attribute, may receive focus depending on the {{SVGAttr("tabindex")}} attribute, contributes to bounding box calculations and clipping paths, and does affect text layout.
- `collapse`
  - : This value is equal to `hidden`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```css hidden
html,
body,
svg {
  height: 100%;
}
```

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 220 120" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect
    x="10"
    y="10"

    <rect x="120" y="20" width="80" height="80" visibility="hidden" />
  </g>
</svg>
```

      class="invisible" />
    <path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none" />
  </svg>
  <span> click me </span>
</button>
```

#### CSS

```css
svg {
  display: inline !important;
}
span {
  vertical-align: 50%;
}
button {
  line-height: 1em;
}
.invisible {
  visibility: hidden;
}
```

#### JavaScript

```js
const button = document.querySelector("button");
button.addEventListener("click", (evt) => {
  button
    .querySelector("svg > path:nth-of-type(1)")
    .classList.toggle("invisible");
  button
    .querySelector("svg > path:nth-of-type(2)")

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 100 300" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <!-- With a width of 0 or less, nothing will be rendered -->
  <rect
    x="0"
    y="0"
    width="0"
    height="90"
    fill="red"
    stroke-width="5"

If a {{cssxref("length")}} is provided without a unit identifier (e.g., an unqualified number such as 128), the browser processes the \<length> as a width value in the current user coordinate system.

If a \<length> is provided with one of the unit identifiers (e.g., .25em or 1%), then the browser converts the \<length> into a corresponding value in the current user coordinate system.

> [!NOTE]
> As a presentation attribute, `word-spacing` also has a CSS property counterpart: {{cssxref("word-spacing")}}. When both are specified, the CSS property takes priority.

## Elements

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("text")}}
- {{SVGElement("textPath")}}
- {{SVGElement("tspan")}}

## Usage notes

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td><code>normal</code> | {{cssxref("length")}}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Animatable</th>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Default values</th>
      <td><code>normal</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

For a description of the values, please refer to the [CSS `letter-spacing`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/letter-spacing#values) property.

## Examples

This example includes two {{SVGElement("text")}} elements with different `word-spacing` values.

```css hidden
html,
body,
svg {
  height: 100%;
}
```

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 250 50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <text y="20" word-spacing="4">Bigger spacing between words</text>
  <text x="0" y="40" word-spacing="-0.5">Smaller spacing between words</text>
</svg>
```

# writing-mode

The **`writing-mode`** attribute specifies whether the initial inline-progression-direction for a {{SVGElement("text")}} element shall be left-to-right, right-to-left, or top-to-bottom. The `writing-mode` attribute applies only to {{ SVGElement("text") }} elements; the attribute is ignored for {{ SVGElement("tspan") }} and {{ SVGElement("textPath") }} sub-elements. (Note that the inline-progression-direction can change within a {{ SVGElement("text") }} element due to the Unicode bidirectional algorithm and properties {{ SVGAttr("direction") }} and {{ SVGAttr("unicode-bidi") }}.)

> [!NOTE]
> As a presentation attribute, `writing-mode` also has a CSS property counterpart: {{cssxref("writing-mode")}}. When both are specified, the CSS property takes priority.

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("text")}}
- {{SVGElement("textPath")}}
- {{SVGElement("tspan")}}

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

- `horizontal-tb`
  - : This value defines a top-to-bottom block flow direction. Both the writing mode and the typographic mode are horizontal.
- `vertical-rl`
  - : This value defines a right-to-left block flow direction. Both the writing mode and the typographic mode are vertical.
- `vertical-lr`
  - : This value defines a left-to-right block flow direction. Both the writing mode and the typographic mode are vertical.

### `<tspan>`

For {{SVGElement('tspan')}}, if it contains a single value, `x` defines the x coordinate where the _content text position_ must be placed. The _content text position_ is usually a point on the baseline of the first line of text. The exact _content text position_ is influenced by other properties, such as {{SVGAttr('text-anchor')}} or {{cssxref('direction')}}.

If it contains multiple values, `x` defines the x coordinate of each individual glyph from the text. If there are fewer values than glyphs, the remaining glyphs are placed in line with the last positioned glyph. If there are more values than glyphs, the extra values are ignored.

### `<use>`

For {{SVGElement('use')}}, `x` defines the x coordinate of the upper left corner of the referenced element.

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td>
        <strong
          ><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Guides/Content_type#length"
            >&#x3C;length></a
          ></strong
        >
        |
        <strong
          ><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Guides/Content_type#percentage"
            >&#x3C;percentage></a
          ></strong
        >
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Default value</th>
      <td><code>0</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Animatable</th>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

> [!NOTE]
> Declaring a `<length>` or `<percentage>` value in CSS using the {{cssxref("x")}} _geometry property_ overrides the x-axis coordinate of the `<use>` set by the `x` attribute in some browsers.
> This behavior is non-standard, deprecated, and likely to be removed in future browser versions.

## Examples

This example contains three {{SVGElement("rect")}} elements, each with an `x` value smaller than the previous value.

```css hidden
html,
body,
svg {
  height: 100%;
}
```

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 300 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect x="220" y="20" width="60" height="60" fill="red" />
  <rect x="120" y="20" width="60" height="60" fill="yellow" />
  <rect x="20" y="20" width="60" height="60" fill="blue" />
</svg>
```

# xlink:arcrole

{{Deprecated_Header}}

The **`xlink:arcrole`** attribute specifies a contextual role for the element and corresponds to the [RDF Primer](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/) notion of a property.

This contextual role can differ from the meaning of the resource when taken outside the context of this particular arc. For example, a resource might generically represent a "person," but in the context of a particular arc it might have the role of "mother" and in the context of a different arc it might have the role of "daughter."

You can use this attribute with the following SVG elements:

- {{SVGElement("a")}}
- {{SVGElement("animate")}}
- {{SVGElement("animateMotion")}}
- {{SVGElement("animateTransform")}}
- {{SVGElement("feImage")}}
- {{SVGElement("filter")}}
- {{SVGElement("image")}}
- {{SVGElement("linearGradient")}}
- {{SVGElement("mpath")}}
- {{SVGElement("pattern")}}
- {{SVGElement("radialGradient")}}
- {{SVGElement("script")}}
- {{SVGElement("set")}}
- {{SVGElement("textPath")}}
- {{SVGElement("use")}}
