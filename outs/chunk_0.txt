# Abstraction

**Abstraction** in {{Glossary("computer programming")}} is a way to reduce complexity and allow efficient design and implementation in complex software systems. It hides the technical complexity of systems behind simpler {{Glossary("API", "APIs")}}.

## Advantages of Data Abstraction

- Helps the user to avoid writing low-level code.
- Avoids code duplication and increases reusability.
- Can change the internal implementation of a class independently without affecting the user.
- Helps to increase the security of an application or program as only important details are provided to the user.

## Example

```js
class ImplementAbstraction {
  // method to set values of internal members
  set(x, y) {
    this.a = x;
    this.b = y;
  }

  display() {
    console.log(`a = ${this.a}`);
    console.log(`b = ${this.b}`);
  }
}

const obj = new ImplementAbstraction();
obj.set(10, 20);
obj.display();
// a = 10
// b = 20
```

# Accent

An **accent** is a typically bright color that contrasts with the more utilitarian background and foreground colors within a color scheme. These are present in the visual style of many platforms (though not all).

On the web, an accent is sometimes used in {{HTMLElement("input")}} elements for the active portion of the control, for instance, the background of a checked [checkbox](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/checkbox).

### CSS related to the accent

You can set the color of the accent for a given element by setting the element's CSS {{cssxref("accent-color")}} property to the appropriate {{cssxref("&lt;color&gt;")}} value.
# Accessibility

**Accessibility** (**A11y**) means enabling as many people as possible to use websites, including those with limited abilities. The most common way to achieve this is by ensuring that assistive technologies work properly to access the content. These technologies include {{glossary("screen reader", "screen readers")}}, screen magnifiers, speech recognition tools, and alternative input devices.

You can measure the accessibility of your website by using tools like [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/accessibility/scoring) and the [Firefox Accessibility Inspector](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/accessibility_inspector/index.html).

Web accessibility is formally defined and discussed at the {{Glossary("W3C")}} through the {{Glossary("WAI", "Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)")}}.

# Accessibility tree

The **accessibility tree** contains {{Glossary("accessibility")}}-related information for most HTML elements.

Browsers convert markup into an internal representation called the _[DOM tree](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model)_. The DOM tree contains objects representing all the markup's elements, attributes, and text nodes. Browsers then create an accessibility tree based on the DOM tree, which is used by platform-specific Accessibility APIs to provide a representation that can be understood by assistive technologies, such as screen readers.

There are four properties in an accessibility tree object:

- **name**
  - : How can we refer to this thing? For instance, a link with the text "Read more" will have "Read more" as its name (find more on how names are computed in the [Accessible Name and Description Computation spec](https://w3c.github.io/accname/)).
- **description**
  - : How do we describe this thing, if we want to provide more description beyond the name? The description of a table could explain what kind of information the table contains.
- [**role**](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles)
  - : What kind of thing is it? For example, is it a button, a nav bar, or a list of items?
- [**state**](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes)
  - : Does it have a state? Examples include checked or unchecked checkbox states and collapsed or expanded states for the [`<summary>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/summary) element.

Additionally, the accessibility tree often contains information on what can be done with an element: a link can be _followed_, a text input can be _typed into_, etc.

While still in draft form within the Web Incubator Community Group as of April 2022, the **[Accessibility Object Model](https://wicg.github.io/aom/explainer.html) (AOM)** intends to incubate APIs that make it easier to express accessibility semantics and potentially allow read access to the computed accessibility tree.

# Accessible description

An **accessible description** is the description of a user interface element that provides additional information to help users of assistive technology understand the UI element and its context. It's associated with an HTML or SVG element and gives users additional context about its purpose beyond what is provided by the element's {{glossary("accessible name")}}. This is particularly important for users who rely on assistive technologies like {{glossary("Screen_reader", "screen readers")}}. An element's accessible description is part of the {{glossary("accessibility tree")}}.

For example, the accessible name of a {{htmlelement("table")}} is provided by its first {{htmlelement("caption")}}. In the case of complex data tables, a sentence or two describing the table can provide a description. This can be a paragraph right before or after the table, both visually and in source code order. If elsewhere in source order, or to make the associate explicit, the [`aria-describedby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-describedby) attribute can be used to associate the table with its description.

Similarly, when a user is asked to create a password, the `<label>` for the {{htmlelement("input")}} of type `password` provides its accessible name. A good accessible description includes the requirements for the password is a way that is visible to all users. It can be explicitly associated with the input via its `aria-describedby` attribute, which adds it to the accessibility tree as the 'description' for that node.

Descriptions are reduced to text strings. In our password example, if the inputs's `aria-describedby` attribute value is the `id` of an HTML {{htmlelement("ul")}} with a list of requirements, the description is concatenated text and text equivalents of all the list items.

You can inspect the accessible description for any element on your page: look at your browser's developer tools' accessibility tab, which provides the accessibility information for the currently selected element.

## Accessible description computation

For HTML elements, if an element doesn't have an accessible description, the description needs to be programmatically associated with the related element. The accessibility object model (AOM) computes the accessible description by checking this features, in order, until it is defined:

1. [`aria-describedby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-describedby) attribute.

2. [`aria-description`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-description) attribute.

3. Language-specific features that participate in the description computation if the feature is not already being used to define the {{glossary("accessible name")}}. For example:
   - A {{htmlelement("summary")}} is described by the content of {{htmlelement("details")}} it is nested in.
   - {{htmlelement("input")}} buttons (with type attribute `button`, `submit` or `reset`) are described by their `value` attribute's value.
   - In SVG, the content of the [`<desc>`](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/desc) element, if present, otherwise, the text contained in descendant text container elements (i.e., [`<text>`](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/text)), if they are not already used for the {{glossary("accessible name")}}

4. If none of the above provide a description, the [`title`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/title) attribute is used, if the `title` is not the {{glossary("accessible name")}} for that element.

5. If none of the above defines an accessible description, the accessible description is empty.

The steps for defining accessible description in HTML are defined in the [HTML-AAM Accessible Description](https://w3c.github.io/html-aam/#accdesc-computation)). Accessible description for SVG elements follow the same steps with small differences that are enumerated at [SVG-AAM Accessible Description](https://w3c.github.io/svg-aam/#mapping_additional_nd)).

# Accessible name

An **accessible name** is the name of a user interface element; it is the text associated with an HTML element that provides users of assistive technology with a label for the element.

Accessible names convey the purpose or intent of the element. This helps users understand what the element is for and how they can interact with it. In general, accessible names for elements should be unique to a page. This helps users distinguish an element from other elements and helps users identify the element they want to interact with.

Depending on the element and the HTML markup, the value of the accessible name may be derived from visible (e.g., the text within {{HTMLElement("figcaption")}}) or invisible (e.g., the `aria-label` attribute set on an element) content, or a combination of both. How an element's accessible name is determined is based on the [accessible name calculation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/names-and-descriptions/#name_calculation), which is different for different elements.

It is best to use visible text as the accessible name. Many elements, including {{HTMLElement("a")}}, {{HTMLElement("td")}} and {{HTMLElement("button")}}, can get their accessible name from their content. For example, given `<a href="foo.html">Bar</a>`, the accessible name of this hyperlink is "Bar."

Other elements get their accessible name from the content of associated elements. For example, when a {{HTMLElement("fieldset")}} or {{HTMLElement("table")}} element contains a descendant {{HTMLElement("legend")}} or {{HTMLElement("caption")}} element, respectively, the association of the nested element providing an accessible name for the parent is automatic. For form elements like {{HTMLElement("textarea")}} and {{HTMLElement("input")}}, the accessible name comes from the associated {{HTMLElement("label")}} element. The association needs to be explicitly defined by setting the `for` attribute in the `<label>` element to match the form element's `id`. Alternatively, an implicit association is created when the form control is directly nested within the `<label>` element.

For some elements, the accessible name comes from the element's attributes; for example, the `alt` attribute in the case of {{HTMLElement("img")}}. Given `<img src="grape.jpg" alt="banana"/>`, the image's accessible name is "banana."

To create an association between visible content and an element or multiple text nodes and an element, the [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) attribute can be used. If there is no visible text to associate with a UI element needing an accessible name, the [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) attribute can be used. Names should not be added to elements marking up inline text, like {{HTMLElement("code")}}, {{HTMLElement("del")}}, and {{HTMLElement("mark")}}.

Many elements, such as sections of textual content, don't need an accessible name. All controls should have an accessible name. All images that convey information and aren't purely presentational do too.

Assistive technologies provide users with the accessibility name property, which includes the accessible name along with the element's role. While many elements don't need an accessible name, it's necessary to provide an accessible name to override or supplement the content of elements with specified [roles](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles). For example, a [`tabpanel`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tabpanel_role) is a section of content that appears after a user activates the associated element with a [`tab`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tab_role) role. This role can be set on an element with no needed name, like the {{HTMLElement("div")}} element. The `tab` is the control and must have an accessible name. The `tabpanel` is the child (content section) of the `tab`. Adding `aria-labelledby` to the `tabpanel` is a best practice.

# Adobe Flash

[**Flash**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash) is an _obsolete_ technology developed by Adobe for viewing expressive web applications, multimedia content, and streaming media. It can be used in a web {{glossary("browser")}} using the Flash Player {{glossary("plugin")}}, which was available for most desktop and mobile platforms until reaching end-of-life in 2021.

# Advance measure

The **advance measure** is the total space the glyph takes, either horizontally or vertically, depending on the current writing direction. It is equal to the distance traveled by the cursor, placed directly in front of and then shifted behind the character.

This term is used in the definition of several CSS {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}} units.
The _advance measure_ of unit `ch` is either the width or height of character "0" in the given typeface, depending on whether the horizontal or vertical axis is currently used. A similar _advance measure_ of unit `ic` is the width or height of the "水" character.

# Ajax

Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (**Ajax**, or **AJAX**) is a web development technique in which a web app fetches content from the server by making asynchronous HTTP requests, and uses the new content to update the relevant parts of the page without requiring a full page load. This can make the page more responsive, because only the parts that need to be updated are requested.

Ajax can be used to create {{Glossary("SPA", "single-page apps")}}, in which the entire web app consists of a single document, which uses Ajax to update its content as needed.

Initially Ajax was implemented using the {{domxref("XMLHttpRequest")}} interface, but the {{domxref("Window/fetch", "fetch()")}} API is more suitable for modern web applications: it is more powerful, more flexible, and integrates better with fundamental web app technologies such as [service workers](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API). Modern web frameworks also provide abstractions for Ajax.

This technique is so common in modern web development that the specific term "Ajax" is rarely used.

# Algorithm

An **algorithm** is a self-contained series of instructions to perform a function.

In other words, an algorithm is a means of describing a way to solve a problem so that it can be solved repeatedly, by humans or machines. Computer scientists compare the efficiency of algorithms through the concept of "Algorithmic Complexity" or "Big O" notation.

For example:

- A cooking recipe is an algorithm for humans.
- A sorting algorithm is often used in computer programming to explain to a machine how to sort data.

Common algorithms are Pathfinding algorithms such as the optimization [Traveling Salesman Problem](https://optimization.cbe.cornell.edu/index.php?title=Traveling_salesman_problem), [Tree Traversal algorithms](https://brilliant.org/wiki/traversals/), and so on.

There are also [Machine Learning algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/articles/machine-learning-algorithms) such as [Linear Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Deep Convolutional Neural Network, and so on.

# Alignment container

The **alignment container** is the rectangle that the {{glossary("alignment subject")}} is aligned within. This is defined by the layout mode; it is usually the alignment subject's containing block, and assumes the writing mode of the box establishing the containing block.

# Alignment subject

In [CSS box alignment](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_box_alignment) the **alignment subject** is the thing (or things) being aligned within the {{glossary("alignment container")}} by the property.

For {{cssxref("justify-self")}} and {{cssxref("align-self")}}, the alignment subject is the margin box of the box the property is set on, using the writing mode of that box. For {{cssxref("justify-content")}} and {{cssxref("align-content")}}, the writing mode of the box is also used.

The definition of the alignment subject depends on the layout mode being used.

- Block containers (including table cells)
  - : The entire content of the block as a single unit.
- Multicol containers
  - : The column boxes, with any spacing inserted between column boxes added to the relevant column gaps.
- Flex containers
  - : For {{cssxref("justify-content")}}, the flex items in each flex line. For {{cssxref("align-content")}}, the flex lines. Note, this only has an effect on multi-line flex containers.
- Grid containers
  - : The grid tracks in the appropriate axis, with any spacing inserted between tracks added to the relevant gutters. Collapsed gutters are treated as a single opportunity for space insertion.

# Alpha (alpha channel)

The **alpha channel** specifies to opacity of a ({{CSSxRef("&lt;color&gt;")}}). Colors are represented in digital form as a collection of numbers, each representing the strength or intensity level of a given component of the color. Each of these components is called a **channel**. In a typical image file, the color channels describe how much red, green, and blue are used to make up the final color. To represent a color through which the background can be seen to some extent, a fourth channel is added to the color: the alpha channel.

For example, the color `#8921F2` (also described as `rgb(137 33 242)` or `hsl(270 89% 54)`) is a nice shade of purple. Below you see a small box of that color in the top-left corner and a box of the _same_ color but with an alpha channel set at 50% (or 0.5) opacity, `#8921F280`, where `80` is the hexadecimal equivalent of 50%. This color is also described as `rgb(137 33 242 / 50%)` or `hsl(270 89% 54 / 50%)`. The two boxes are drawn on top of a paragraph of text.

![Image showing the effect of an alpha channel on a color.](alpha-channel-example.png)

As you can see, the color without an alpha channel completely blocks the background text, while the box with the alpha channel leaves it visible through the purple background color.

# API

An **API** (Application Programming Interface) is a set of features and rules that exist inside a software program (the application) enabling interaction with it through software - as opposed to a human user interface. The API can be seen as a simple contract (the interface) between the application offering it and other items, such as third-party software or hardware.

In Web development, an API is generally a set of code features (e.g., {{glossary("method","methods")}}, {{Glossary("property","properties")}}, events, and {{Glossary("URL","URLs")}}) that a developer can use in their apps for interacting with components of a user's web browser, other software/hardware on the user's computer, or third-party websites and services.

For example:

- The [getUserMedia](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia) API can be used to grab audio and video from a user's webcam, which is then available to the developer, for example, recording video and audio, broadcasting it to another user in a conference call, or capturing image stills from the video.
- The [Geolocation API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation) can be used to retrieve location information from services the user has available on their device (e.g., GPS), which can then be used in conjunction with other services, such as the [Google Maps APIs](https://developers.google.com/maps/), to plot the user's location on a custom map and show them what tourist attractions are in their area.
- The [Web Animations API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API) can be used to animate parts of a web page — for example, to programmatically move or rotate images.

# Apple Safari

[**Safari**](https://www.apple.com/safari/) is a {{Glossary("Browser","web browser")}} developed by Apple and is built into Apple's operating systems, including macOS (for Mac computers), iPadOS (for iPad tablets), iOS (for iPhones), and visionOS (for augmented reality devices like the Apple Vision Pro).

Safari uses the open source {{glossary("WebKit")}} rendering engine, which was derived from [KHTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KHTML).

# Application context

**Application context** refers to the top-level {{glossary("browsing context")}} of a [web application](/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps).
It determines how an app's browsing context, such as a tab or a window, is presented and behaves.

Web developers define the application context in the [web app's manifest file](/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Manifest).
They use the [`scope`](/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Manifest/Reference/scope) member in the manifest to specify the set of URLs that are considered part of the application context and to which the manifest applies.

The manifest is applied after the application context is created but before navigation begins to either a start URL or a deep link.
A **start URL** is the initial page of the web app.
A **deep link** is a URL that directs users to a specific page within the web app, bypassing the home page.
The application context ensures that the app's defined behavior and presentation are maintained within its scope.

When an application context is created, browsers must immediately navigate to a start URL or a deep link.
This navigation replaces the current entry in the browsing history.
If the application context is created to navigate to a deep link, the browser navigates directly to that deep link; otherwise, it navigates to the start URL.

Note that the start URL is not necessarily the value of the [`start_url`](/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Manifest/Reference/start_url) member in the manifest. Browsers may ignore the specified `start_url` or may allow users to change its value when adding the web app to their device's home screen or bookmarking it.

# Argument

**Arguments** are {{glossary("value", "values")}} ({{Glossary("primitive")}} or {{Glossary("object")}}) passed as input to a {{Glossary("function")}}. Do not confuse arguments with {{Glossary("parameter","parameters")}}, which are the names used in the function definition to refer to the arguments.

For example:

```js
const argument1 = "Web";
const argument2 = "Development";
example(argument1, argument2); // passing two arguments

// This function takes two values
function example(parameter1, parameter2) {
  console.log(parameter1); // Output = "Web"
  console.log(parameter2); // Output = "Development"
}
```

The argument order within the function call should be the same as the parameters order in the function definition.

```js
const argument1 = "foo";
const argument2 = [1, 2, 3];
example(argument1, argument2); // passing two arguments

// This function takes a single value, so the second argument passed is ignored
function example(parameter) {
  console.log(parameter); // Output = foo
}
```

# ARIA

**ARIA** (_{{Glossary("Accessibility", "Accessible")}} Rich {{glossary("Internet")}} Applications_) is a {{Glossary("W3C")}} specification developed by {{Glossary("WAI")}} to make Web content and Web applications more accessible to people with disabilities. It especially helps with dynamic content and advanced user interface controls developed with HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies.

The specification, for example, allows you to add the attribute `role="alert"` to a {{HTMLElement("p")}} {{glossary("tag")}} to notify a sight-challenged user that the information is important and time-sensitive (which you might otherwise convey through text color).

# ARPA

**.arpa** (address and routing parameter area) is a {{glossary("TLD","top-level domain")}} in the Domain Name System (DNS) used for Internet infrastructure purposes, especially reverse DNS lookup (i.e., find the {{glossary('domain name')}} for a given {{glossary("IP address")}}).

The name came from **ARPA**, currently known as [DARPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA), the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. DARPA is credited with developing precursors to the Internet ({{glossary("ARPANET")}}), GPS, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality. The domain was originally intended only to serve a temporary function for facilitating the systematic naming of the ARPANET computers, but failed to remove it after infrastructural uses had been sanctioned. As a result, the ARPA domain name is a backronym for "Address and Routing Parameter Area".

{{glossary("TLD")}} was designed at DARPA during a time when it was called ARPA, hence the `.arpa` domain name.

The most prominent `.arpa` domains include `in-addr.arpa` and `ip6.arpa`, which provide namespaces for reverse DNS lookup of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses respectively.

# ARPANET

The **ARPANET** (Advanced Research Projects Agency NETwork) was an early computer network, constructed in 1969 as a robust medium to transmit sensitive military data and to connect leading research groups throughout the United States. ARPANET first ran NCP (Network Control Protocol) and subsequently the first version of the Internet protocol or {{glossary("TCP")}}/{{glossary("IPv4","IP")}} suite, making ARPANET a prominent part of the nascent {{glossary("Internet")}}. ARPANET was closed in early 1990.

# Array

An **array** is an ordered collection of data (either {{Glossary("primitive")}} or {{Glossary("object")}} depending upon the language). Arrays are used to store multiple values under a single variable name. A regular variable, on the other hand, can store only one value.

Each item in an array has a number attached to it, called a numeric index, that allows you to access it. In JavaScript, arrays start at index zero and can be manipulated with various {{Glossary("Method", "methods")}}.

Arrays in JavaScript look like this:

```js
// Arrays in JavaScript can hold different types of data
const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const barbieDollNamesArray = ["Barbie", "Ken", "Midge", "Allan", "Skipper"];

// Array indexes starts at 0.
console.log(myArray[0]); // output: 1
console.log(barbieDollNamesArray[2]); // output: "Midge"
```

# ASCII

**ASCII** (_American Standard Code for Information Interchange_) is a {{glossary("character encoding")}} standard using 7-bit to represent 128
{{glossary("character", "characters")}} used by computers and other devices for encoding letters, numbers, punctuation, and control codes into digital form.

The first 33 ASCII {{glossary("code point", "code points")}} are non-printing control codes including the carriage return, line feed, tab, and several obsolete non-printable codes stemming from its origin of representing telegraph codes. The other 95 are printable characters, including digits (0-9), lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters, and punctuation symbols.

In the modern age, most computer systems use {{glossary("Unicode")}} instead, which is an extension of ASCII, supporting millions of code points. {{Glossary("UTF-8")}} superseded ASCII on the Web in 2007.

# Aspect ratio

An **aspect ratio** is the proportional relationship between an element or {{glossary("viewport")}}'s width and height. It is represented as a {{cssxref("ratio")}} of two numbers.

Having an aspect ratio, whether it's an inherent aspect ratio like with images and videos or if it's extrinsically set, maintains the intended proportions of an element. You can also query an element or viewport's aspect, which is useful in developing flexible components and layouts.

In CSS, the {{cssxref("ratio")}} data type is written as `width / height` (e.g., `1 / 1` for a square, `16 / 9` for widescreen) or a single number, in which case the number represents the width and the height is `1`.

```css
.wideBox {
  aspect-ratio: 5 / 2;
}
.tallBox {
  aspect-ratio: 0.25;
}
```

In SVG, the aspect ratio is defined by the a four-value [`viewBox`](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/viewBox) attribute. The first two values the smallest X and Y origin coordinates the SVG can have, and the second two values are the width and height which set the aspect ratio of the SVG.

```svg
<svg viewBox="0 0 300 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"></svg>
```

In JavaScript APIs, querying an aspect ratio returns a double-precision floating-point number representing the width divided by height. You can also use JavaScript to set an element's aspect ratio. For example, setting an aspect ratio constraint for a 1920x1080 video using the {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack")}} or {{domxref("MediaTrackSettings")}} dictionary's [`aspectRatio`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaTrackSettings/aspectRatio) property would be computed as 16/9, or 1920/1080, which is `1.7777777778`:

```js
const constraints = {
  width: 1920,
  height: 1080,
  aspectRatio: 1.777777778,
};

myTrack.applyConstraints(constraints);
```

# Asynchronous

The term **asynchronous** refers to two or more objects or events that do not exist or happen at the same time, that is, they are **not** {{glossary("synchronous")}}. When multiple related things happen without any being dependent on the completion of previous happenings, they are asynchronous.

In computing, the word "asynchronous" is used in two major contexts, as explained below.

## In networking and communications

Asynchronous communication is a method of exchanging messages in which the sending, receiving, and processing of each message is not dependent on the sending, receipt, or processing of other messages. In asynchronous communication, each party receives and processes messages when convenient or possible to do so, rather than doing so immediately upon receipt. Additionally, messages may be sent without waiting for acknowledgement, with the understanding that if a problem occurs, the recipient will request corrections or otherwise handle the situation.

Email is a type of asynchronous human communication. A sender sends an email. The recipient reads the email and responds to it (or not) at their convenience, not necessarily right away. All parties can continue to send and receive messages at any time. Emails don't have to be scheduled in a particular sequence.

In asynchronous software, making a request, such as to a server, does not block other processes while waiting for the response. The software can continue performing other tasks. For example, in [promise-based APIs](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Async_JS/Implementing_a_promise-based_API), {{JSxRef("Promise")}} objects are created for long operations. After the operation is complete, the promise is handled. With promises, the software doesn't have to wait for the operation to finish.

## In software design

Asynchronous software design expands upon the concept by building code that allows a program to ask that a task be performed alongside the original task (or tasks), without stopping to wait for the task to complete. When the secondary task is completed, the original task is notified using an agreed-upon mechanism so that it knows the work is done, and that the result, if any, is available.

There are a number of programming techniques for implementing asynchronous software. See the article [Asynchronous JavaScript](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Async_JS) for an introduction to them.

# ATAG

**Authoring Tool {{glossary("Accessibility")}} Guidelines (ATAG)** is a {{Glossary("W3C")}} recommendation for building accessible-authoring tools that produce accessible contents.

Authoring tools are software applications that people use to create web content. ATAG explains how to:

- make the authoring tools themselves **accessible**, so that people with disabilities can create web content
- help authors create more accessible web content — specifically: enable, support, and promote the production of content that conforms to {{glossary("WCAG", "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines")}} (WCAG).

# Attribute

An **attribute** extends an {{Glossary("HTML")}} or {{Glossary("XML")}} {{Glossary("element")}}, changing its behavior or providing metadata.

An attribute always has the form `name="value"` (the attribute's identifier followed by its associated value). You may see attributes without an equals sign or a value. That is a shorthand for providing the empty string in HTML. However, this is not valid in XML: XML requires all attributes to have an explicit value.

A number of HTML attributes are {{Glossary("Boolean/HTML", "boolean attributes")}}. These attributes' values are only controlled by the presence or absence of the attribute. See {{Glossary("Boolean/HTML", "boolean attributes")}} for more information.

## Reflection of an attribute

Attributes may be _reflected_ into a particular property of the specific interface.

This means that the value of the attribute can be read or written directly in JavaScript through a property on the corresponding interface, and vice versa.
The reflected properties offer a more natural programming approach than getting and setting attributes using the {{domxref("Element.getAttribute()","getAttribute()")}} and {{domxref("Element.setAttribute()","setAttribute()")}} methods of the {{domxref("Element")}} interface.

For more information see [Attribute reflection](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Reflected_attributes).

# Authentication

**Authentication** is in general the process of proving that some fact is genuine. More specifically, in web security, it is the process of verifying the claimed identity of some entity, such as a user. This then makes it possible to decide whether to grant the user the access that they are requesting, such as being signed into a particular account.

Authentication is typically performed by having a user present a user identifier along with a {{glossary("credential")}}, such as a password, a one-time code, or an assertion signed with a private key. The system then checks the binding between the user identifier and the credential, so it can decide whether or not to authenticate the user.

Types of authentication information, also called _authentication factors_, are commonly presented in three categories:

- Something the user knows, such as a password.
- Something the user has, such as a phone.
- Something the user is, such as a thumbprint.

{{glossary("Multi-factor authentication")}} (MFA) systems require the user to provide more than one factor: for example, a password combined with a one-time code generated using an authenticator app on the user's phone.

## See also

- {{rfc("4949", "Internet Security Glossary")}}
# Authenticator

An **authenticator** is an entity that can perform the cryptographic operations needed to register and authenticate users, and securely store the cryptographic keys used in these operations.

An authenticator might be implemented in hardware or software. It may be integrated into the device, like the [Touch ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_ID) system in Apple devices or the [Windows Hello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10#System_security) system, or it might be a removable module like a [YubiKey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YubiKey).

The [Web Authentication API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API) makes authenticators available to websites as part of the [Credential Management API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Credential_Management_API). This enables websites to use authenticators to generate {{glossary("credential", "credentials")}} based on {{glossary("public-key cryptography")}}, which can then be used to sign users into websites.

# Bandwidth

**Bandwidth** is the measure of how much information can pass through a data connection in a given amount of time. It is usually measured in multiples of bits-per-second (bps), for example megabits-per-second (Mbps) or gigabits-per-second (Gbps).

## See also

- [Bandwidth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth) on Wikipedia
# Base64

**Base64** is a group of similar [binary-to-text encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-to-text_encoding) schemes that represent binary data in an {{glossary("ASCII")}} string format by transforming it into a radix-64 representation. The term _Base64_ originates from a specific [MIME content transfer encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME#Content-Transfer-Encoding).

Base64 encoding schemes are commonly used to encode binary data for storage or transfer over media that can only deal with ASCII text (or some superset of ASCII that still falls short of accepting arbitrary binary data). This ensures that the data remains intact without modification during transport. Common applications of Base64 include:

- Email via [MIME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME)
- Storing complex data in [XML](/en-US/docs/Web/XML)
- Encoding binary data so that it can be included in a [`data:` URL](/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Schemes/data)

## Base64 characters

When the term "Base64" is used on its own to refer to a specific {{glossary("algorithm")}}, it typically refers to the version of Base64 outlined in {{rfc("4648", "", 4)}}, which uses the following alphabet to represent the radix-64 digits, alongside `=` as a padding character:

```plain
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/
```

## URL and filename safe Base64

A common variant of this definition allows only characters that are safe to use in filenames and {{glossary("URL")}} values.
This version, defined in {{rfc("4648", "", 5)}}, omits the padding and replaces `+` and `/` with `-` and `_`.

You don't need this encoding if you are not putting the data in a path segment or query parameter — for example, [data URLs](/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Schemes/data) have neither and can use the standard Base64 encoding.

## Encoded size increase

Each Base64 digit represents 6 bits of data (64 = 2<sup>6</sup>). So, three 8-bit bytes of the input string/binary file (3×8 bits = 24 bits) can be represented by four 6-bit Base64 digits (4×6 = 24 bits).

This means that the Base64 version of a string or file is typically roughly a third larger than its source (the exact size increase depends on various factors, such as the absolute length of the string, its length modulo 3, and whether padding characters are used).

## Last chunk

The base64 string can be partitioned into chunks of 4 characters, where the last chunk may have fewer than 4 characters. The last chunk may be padded with `=` characters so it's exactly 4 characters long. Excluding padding characters, the last chunk may be one of the following:

- 2 characters: encodes 12 bits representing 1 byte (8 bits) of data
- 3 characters: encodes 18 bits representing 2 bytes (16 bits) of data
- 4 characters: encodes 24 bits representing 3 bytes (24 bits) of data

In the first two cases, the characters may have 4 or 2 extra trailing bits that don't represent any data. In this case, [RFC 4648](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-3.5) requires encoders to set these bits to zero and decoders to optionally throw an error if they are not zero. For example, if the encoded data is a single byte `0b01010101`, then it needs two characters `0b010101` (`V`) and `0b010000` (`Q`), where the second character has 4 trailing bits set to zero. Decoding `VR==` (where the second character represents `0b010001`) technically results in the same byte `0b01010101`, but the decoder may throw an error due to the trailing bits not being zero.

## JavaScript support

The {{jsxref("Uint8Array")}} class provides the {{jsxref("Uint8Array.fromBase64()")}}, {{jsxref("Uint8Array.prototype.toBase64()")}}, and {{jsxref("Uint8Array.prototype.setFromBase64()")}} methods for conversion to/from base64 strings.

Browsers also natively provide two JavaScript functions for decoding and encoding Base64 strings:

- {{domxref("Window.btoa()")}} (also {{domxref("WorkerGlobalScope.btoa()", "available in workers", "", "nocode")}}): creates a Base64-encoded ASCII string from a string of binary data ("btoa" should be read as "binary to ASCII").
- {{domxref("Window.atob()")}} (also {{domxref("WorkerGlobalScope.atob()", "available in workers", "", "nocode")}}): decodes a Base64-encoded string ("atob" should be read as "ASCII to binary").

> [!NOTE]
> Base64 is a binary encoding rather than a text encoding, but `btoa` and `atob` were added to the web platform before it supported binary data types. As a result, the two functions use strings to represent binary data, with the {{glossary("code point")}} of each character representing the value of each byte. This has led to a common misconception that `btoa` can be used to encode arbitrary text data — for example, creating a Base64 `data:` URL of a text or HTML document.
>
> However, the byte-to-code-point correspondence only reliably holds true for code points up to `0x7f`. Furthermore, code points over `0xff` will cause `btoa` to throw an error due to exceeding the maximum value for 1 byte. The next section details how to work around this limitation when encoding arbitrary Unicode text.

# Baseline (compatibility)

**Baseline** identifies the availability of web platform features across popular browsers, including APIs, CSS properties, and JavaScript syntax. Baseline describes web features as being either widely available or newly available. Features that do not meet the Baseline criteria are said to have limited availability.

Baseline considers support in the following browsers:

- Apple Safari (iOS)
- Apple Safari (macOS)
- Google Chrome (Android)
- Google Chrome (desktop)
- Microsoft Edge (desktop)
- Mozilla Firefox (Android)
- Mozilla Firefox (desktop)

Baseline is a summary of browser support. It is not a substitute for accessibility, usability, performance, security, or other testing. Baseline may not tell you if a feature works with:

- Older devices and browser releases
- Browsers not covered by the Baseline definition, such as operating system web views
- Assistive technology, such as screen readers.

## Baseline badges

![Green widget with the checkmark: Baseline, widely available. Four browsers logos, all with checkmarks.](high.png)

Features listed as **widely available** have a consistent history of support in each of the Baseline browsers for at least 2.5 years.

![Blue widget with the checkmark: Baseline 2022, newly available. Four browsers' logos, all with checkmarks.](limited.png)

Features listed as **newly available** work in at least the latest stable version of each of the Baseline browsers, but may not work with older browsers and devices.

![Grey widget with the cross: limited availability. Four browsers' logos, two with checkmarks, two with crosses.](low.png)

Features listed with **limited availability** are _not_ yet available in all browsers.

# Baseline

The term **baseline** can have several meanings depending on the context. It may refer to:

{{GlossaryDisambiguation}}
# Baseline (typography)

A **baseline** is an imaginary line along the inline axis of a line box along which individual glyphs of text are aligned. Baselines guide the design of glyphs in a font and the alignment of glyphs from different fonts or font sizes when typesetting.

The **alphabetic baseline** is the value of the CSS `baseline` keyword. The bottom of most alphabetic glyphs typically align with the alphabetic baseline; most characters of European and West Asian fonts rest _on top_ of the alphabetic baseline.

Other writing systems have different baselines. For example, Tibetan and similar unicameral scripts with a strong but not absolute top edge are aligned to the bottom of a "hanging" baseline. East Asian scripts have no baseline; each glyph sits in a square box, with neither ascenders nor descenders. When mixed with scripts with a low baseline, East Asian characters should be set so that the bottom of the character is between the baseline and the descender height.

# BCP 47 language tag

A **BCP 47 language tag** is a string of characters that precisely specifies a human language in terms of the basic language, but also optionally the writing system and dialect. For example, `en` specifies English, but `en-GB` and `en-US` more precisely specify British English and American English, respectively.

BCP 47 language tags are used anywhere on the web platform where a feature has been designed to output different results depending on the specified language, enabling {{glossary("internationalization")}} support.

Examples include:

- The HTML [`lang`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/lang) attribute
- The HTML {{htmlelement("track")}} element
- The {{jsxref("Temporal")}} object
- The {{domxref("CanvasRenderingContext2D.lang")}} property
- The [Translator and Language Detector APIs](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Translator_and_Language_Detector_APIs)

## BCP 47 syntax

The full BCP 47 syntax is specified in {{rfc("5646")}}. It is capable of identifying extremely specific language dialects, but most usage is much simpler.

A language tag is made of hyphen-separated _subtags_, where each subtag indicates a certain property of the language. The three most common subtags are:

- Language subtag
  - : A 2-or-3-character code that defines the basic language, typically written in all lowercase. For example, the language code for English is `en`, and the code for Badeshi is `bdz`.
- Script subtag {{optional_inline}}
  - : This subtag defines the writing system used for the language, and is always 4 characters long, with the first letter capitalized. For example, French-in-Braille is `fr-Brai` and Japanese written with the Katakana alphabet is `ja-Kana`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the language is written in a highly typical way, like English in the Latin alphabet, there is no need to use this subtag.

- Region subtag {{optional_inline}}
  - : This subtag defines a dialect of the base language from a particular location and is either two upper-case letters matching a country code or three numbers matching a non-country area. For example, `es-ES` is for Spanish as spoken in Spain, and `es-013` is Spanish as spoken in Central America. "International Spanish" would just be `es`.

The script subtag precedes the region subtag if both are present — `ru-Cyrl-BY` is Russian, written in the Cyrillic alphabet, as spoken in Belarus.

# Beacon

A web **beacon** is a small object, such as a 1 pixel gif, embedded in markup, used to communicate information back to the web server or to 3rd party servers. Beacons are generally included to provide information about the user for statistical purposes. Beacons are often included within third party scripts for collecting user data, performance metrics and error reporting.

There is a [W3C Draft Beacon Specification](https://w3c.github.io/beacon/) to standardize the beacon as an interface to asynchronously transfer HTTP data from User Agent to a web server prior to page load without negative performance impact.

# Bézier curve

A **Bézier curve** (pronounced \[bezje]) is a mathematically described curve used in computer graphics and animation. In vector images, they are used to model smooth curves that can be scaled indefinitely.

The curve is defined by a set of control points with a minimum of two. Web related graphics and animations often use cubic Béziers, which are curves with four control points P<sub>0</sub>, P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, and P<sub>3</sub>.

To draw a quadratic Bézier curve, two imaginary lines are drawn, one from P<sub>0</sub> to P<sub>1</sub> and the other from P<sub>1</sub> to P<sub>2</sub>. A third imaginary line is drawn with its starting point moving steadily on the first helper line and the end point on the second helper line. On this imaginary line a point is drawn from its starting point moving steadily to its end point. The curve this point describes is the Bézier curve. Here's an animated illustration demonstrating the creation of the curve:

# bfcache

The **back/forward** cache, or **bfcache**, is a performance-enhancing feature available in modern browsers that enables instant back and forward navigation between previously-visited pages. It does this by storing a complete snapshot of a page as the user navigates away from it; the browser can then quickly restore the snapshot if the user decides to return to it, rather than needing to repeat the network requests required to load the page.

The snapshot contains the entire page in memory, including the JavaScript heap; in-progress code is paused when the user navigates away and resumed when they return to the page. A regular HTTP cache entry on the other hand contains only responses to previous requests. The bfcache therefore provides faster results than the HTTP cache.

The downside is that bfcache entries require more resources, and create complexity in terms of how to represent in-progress code. Some code features (for example the [`unload`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/unload_event) handler) are not compatible, so their presence on a page blocks it from using the bfcache.

The bfcache is great for performance, so it is in your interests to make sure your pages are not blocked from using it. You can use the [`notRestoredReasons` API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API/Monitoring_bfcache_blocking_reasons) to monitor whether pages are blocked from using the bfcache, and reasons why.

# BiDi

**BiDi** (BiDirectional) describes a document that contains both right-to-left (RTL) and left-to-right (LTR) text.

User Interfaces should display BiDi content correctly, but many fail. An example is the Hebrew translation of the name Sarah: שרה, spelled (from right-to-left) sin (ש), resh (ר), heh (ה). Many programs would display the letters in the opposite order.

It is possible to flip the left-to-right display order to a right-to-left display order, but doing this sacrifices the ability to display BiDi scripts correctly — at least one is always incorrectly displayed. With bidirectional script support, it is possible to mix characters from different scripts on the same page, regardless of writing direction.

The Unicode standard provides foundations for complete BiDi support, with detailed rules as to how mixtures of left-to-right and right-to-left scripts are to be encoded and displayed.

# BigInt

In {{Glossary("JavaScript")}}, **BigInt** is a numeric data type that can represent integers in the [arbitrary precision format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic). In other programming languages different numeric types can exist, for examples: Integers, Floats, Doubles, or Bignums.

# Binding

In programming, a **binding** is an association of an {{glossary("identifier")}} with a value. Not all bindings are {{glossary("variable", "variables")}} — for example, function {{glossary("parameter", "parameters")}} and the binding created by the {{jsxref("Statements/try...catch", "catch (e)")}} block are not "variables" in the strict sense. In addition, some bindings are implicitly created by the language — for example, {{jsxref("Operators/this", "this")}} and [`new.target`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new.target) in JavaScript.

A binding is {{glossary("mutable")}} if it can be re-assigned, and {{glossary("immutable")}} otherwise; this does _not_ mean that the value it holds is immutable.

A binding is often associated with a {{glossary("scope")}}. Some languages allow re-creating bindings (also called redeclaring) within the same scope, while others don't; in JavaScript, whether bindings can be redeclared depends on the construct used to create the binding.

# Bitwise flags

**Bitwise flags** are sets of variables, usually simple number values, which can be used to enable or disable specific usages or features of a method or other code structure. They can do this quickly and efficiently because they operate at the bit level. Related flags in the same group are generally given complementary values representing different bit positions in a single value (e.g., hexadecimal), so that multiple flag settings can be represented by a single value.

For example, in the {{domxref("WebGPU API", "WebGPU API", "", "nocode")}}, a {{domxref("GPUBuffer")}} object instance is created using the {{domxref("GPUDevice.createBuffer()")}} method. When invoking this method, you define a `usage` property in the descriptor containing one or more flags that enable different allowed usages of that buffer.

```js
const descriptor = {
  usage: GPUBufferUsage.COPY_SRC | GPUBufferUsage.MAP_WRITE,
};
```

These values are defined inside the same namespace, and each one has a hexadecimal value:

| Usage flag                     | Hexadecimal representation | Decimal equivalent |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `GPUBufferUsage.MAP_READ`      | 0x0001                     | 1                  |
| `GPUBufferUsage.MAP_WRITE`     | 0x0002                     | 2                  |
| `GPUBufferUsage.COPY_SRC`      | 0x0004                     | 4                  |
| `GPUBufferUsage.COPY_DST`      | 0x0008                     | 8                  |
| `GPUBufferUsage.INDEX`         | 0x0010                     | 16                 |
| `GPUBufferUsage.VERTEX`        | 0x0020                     | 32                 |
| `GPUBufferUsage.UNIFORM`       | 0x0040                     | 64                 |
| `GPUBufferUsage.STORAGE`       | 0x0080                     | 128                |
| `GPUBufferUsage.INDIRECT`      | 0x0100                     | 256                |
| `GPUBufferUsage.QUERY_RESOLVE` | 0x0200                     | 512                |

When you query the {{domxref("GPUBuffer.usage")}} property, you get a single decimal number returned, which is the sum of the different decimal values for the different usage flags. Returning to the above example, querying `GPUBuffer.usage` for the `GPUBuffer` created with the usage specified earlier would return the following:

- `GPUBufferUsage.COPY_SRC`'s decimal equivalent, 4
- Add `GPUBufferUsage.MAP_WRITE`'s decimal equivalent, 2
- Equals 6.

Because of the values chosen for the different flags, each combination of values is unique, so the program can tell at a glance which flags are set from a single value. In addition, you can easily test which flags are set in the combined value using the bitwise and operator:

```js
if (buffer.usage & GPUBufferUsage.MAP_WRITE) {
  // Buffer has MAP_WRITE usage
}
```

# blink element (<blink> tag)

The **`<blink>` element** (blink tag) is an obsolete HTML feature no longer supported by web browsers and no longer documented on MDN. It was used to make text content blink on and off (flash) continually.

The `<blink>` element was used like this:

```html example-bad
<blink>In ancient browsers, I may have blinked</blink>
```

## Brief history

In the early days of the web (the early- to mid-90s), there were not many features available for styling web pages. The [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) specification (version 1) was first released in 1996 and not adopted consistently by browsers until much later. Before CSS, browsers experimented with several features to make particular text sections stand out and grab the user's attention. The `<blink>` element was one of these, introduced in early versions of [Netscape Navigator](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Netscape_Navigator); [Internet Explorer's](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Microsoft_Internet_Explorer) {{htmlelement("marquee")}} element was another.

The `<blink>` element was apparently created after a conversation in a bar in Mountain View between Netscape engineer [Lou Montulli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Montulli) and colleagues. When he went into the office the next morning, he found that one of his fellow engineers had stayed up all night and implemented it ([read the story here](https://web.archive.org/web/20220331020029/http://www.montulli.org/theoriginofthe%3Cblink%3Etag)).

While initially popular, `<blink>` became much maligned because of overuse; many people found it annoying. More importantly, it degrades readability and can be particularly problematic for users with visual impairments or [cognitive disorders](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Guides/Cognitive_accessibility) such as epilepsy or ADHD. It can be disorienting or, in the worst cases, even [trigger seizures](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Guides/Seizure_disorders).

`<blink>` was never properly specified and never achieved significant cross-browser support. It can be considered a piece of web history.

## Alternatives

- The CSS {{cssxref("text-decoration-line")}} property has a `blink` value that should have the same effect, but most modern browsers ignore it.
- The JavaScript {{jsxref("String.blink()")}} method wraps a text string in `<blink></blink>` tags but, as discussed earlier, this element is no longer supported anywhere.
- [CSS animations](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animations) could still be used to create blinking text. However, you should avoid blinking text on web pages for the reasons discussed above.

# Blink

**Blink** is an open-source browser rendering engine developed by Google as part of Chromium (and therefore part of {{glossary("Google Chrome", "Chrome")}} as well). Specifically, Blink began as a fork of the WebCore library in {{glossary("WebKit")}}, which handles layout, rendering, and {{glossary("DOM")}}, but now stands on its own as a separate {{Glossary("Engine/Rendering", "rendering engine")}}.

# Block-level content

In CSS, content that participates in block layout is called **block-level content**.

In a block layout, boxes are laid out one after the other, vertically, beginning at the top of a containing block. Each box's left outer edge touches the left edge of the containing block.\
A block-level element always starts on a new line. In horizontal writing modes, like English or Arabic, it occupies the entire horizontal space of its parent element (container) and vertical space equal to the height of its contents, thereby creating a "block".

> [!NOTE]
> The above behavior of block layout changes if the containing block's [`writing-mode`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/writing-mode) is set to value other than [the default value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/writing-mode#formal_definition).

> [!NOTE]
> HTML (_HyperText Markup Language_) elements historically were categorized as either "block-level" elements or "inline" elements. As a presentational characteristic, this is now specified by CSS.

## Examples

In this example, two paragraph ({{HTMLElement("p")}}) elements are put in a {{HTMLElement("div")}}.

```html
<div>
  <p>
    This the first paragraph. The background color of these paragraphs have been
    colored to distinguish them from their parent element.
  </p>
  <p>This is the second paragraph.</p>
</div>
```

The paragraph({{HTMLElement("p")}}) elements are block-level by default. That is why they are displayed in block layout:

```css hidden
p {
  background-color: #8abb55;
}
```

# Block cipher mode of operation

A **block cipher mode of operation**, usually just called a "mode" in context, specifies how a block cipher should be used to encrypt or decrypt messages that are longer than the block size.

Most symmetric-key algorithms currently in use are block ciphers: this means that they encrypt data a block at a time. The size of each block is fixed and determined by the algorithm: for example AES uses 16-byte blocks. Block ciphers are always used with a _mode_, which specifies how to securely encrypt messages that are longer than the block size. For example, AES is a cipher, while CTR, CBC, and GCM are all modes. Using an inappropriate mode, or using a mode incorrectly, can completely undermine the security provided by the underlying cipher.
# Block (CSS)

A **block** on a webpage is an {{glossary("HTML")}} {{glossary("element")}} that appears on a new line, i.e., underneath the preceding element in a horizontal writing mode, and above the following element (commonly known as a _block-level element_). For example, {{htmlelement("p")}} is by default a block-level element, whereas {{htmlelement("a")}} is an _inline element_ — you can put several links next to one another in your HTML source and they will sit on the same line as one another in the rendered output.

Using the {{cssxref("display")}} property you can change whether an element displays inline or as a block (among many other options); **blocks** are also subject to the effects of positioning schemes and use of the {{cssxref("position")}} property.

# Block

The term **block** can have several meanings depending on the context. It may refer to:

{{GlossaryDisambiguation}}
# Block (scripting)

In {{glossary("JavaScript")}}, a **block** is a collection of related {{glossary("statement","statements")}} enclosed in braces ("{}"). For example, you can put a block of statements after an {{jsxref("Statements/if...else","if (condition)")}} block, indicating that the interpreter should run the code inside the block if the condition is true, or skip the whole block if the condition is false.

# Boolean attribute (ARIA)

A **boolean attribute** in ARIA is an {{Glossary("Enumerated", "enumerated attribute")}} that includes `true` or `false` in the enumerated list.

In ARIA, booleans only come in the form of strings `"true"` and `"false"`.

# Boolean attribute (HTML)

A **boolean attribute** in {{Glossary("HTML")}} is an {{glossary("attribute")}} that represents `true` or `false` values. If an HTML tag contains a boolean attribute — no matter the value of that attribute — the attribute is set to `true` on that element. If an HTML tag does not contain the attribute, the attribute is set to `false`.

If the attribute is present, it can have one of the following forms:

- the attribute name alone; e.g., `attribute`, meaning its implicit value is the empty string
- the attribute with a value of the empty string; e.g., `attribute=""`
- the attribute with a value of the attribute's name itself, with no leading or trailing whitespace and case ignored; e.g., `attribute="attribute"`, `attribute="ATTRIBUTE"`

> [!NOTE]
> The strings "true" and "false" are invalid values. To set the attribute to `false`, the attribute should be omitted altogether. Though modern browsers treat _any_ string value as `true`, you should not rely on that behavior.

Here's an example of a HTML boolean attribute `checked`:

```html
<!-- The following checkboxes will be checked on initial rendering -->
<input type="checkbox" checked />
<input type="checkbox" checked="" />
<input type="checkbox" checked="checked" />
<input type="checkbox" checked="Checked" />

<!-- The following checkbox will not be checked on initial rendering -->
<input type="checkbox" />
```

# Boolean

In computer science, a **Boolean** is a logical data type that can have only the values `true` or `false`.

For example, in JavaScript, Boolean conditionals are often used to decide which sections of code to execute (such as in [if statements](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else)) or repeat (such as in [for loops](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for)).

Below is some JavaScript pseudocode (it's not truly executable code) demonstrating this concept.

```js-nolint
/* JavaScript if statement */
if (boolean conditional) {
  // code to execute if the conditional is true
}

if (boolean conditional) {
  console.log("boolean conditional resolved to true");
} else {
  console.log("boolean conditional resolved to false");
}

/* JavaScript for loop */
for (control variable; boolean conditional; counter) {
  // code to execute repeatedly if the conditional is true
}
```

The Boolean value is named after English mathematician [George Boole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole), who pioneered the field of mathematical logic.

Above is a general introduction. The term **Boolean** can have more specific meanings depending on the context. It may refer to:

# Boolean (JavaScript)

A **Boolean** in JavaScript is a {{Glossary("Primitive", "primitive value")}} that can be either `true` or `false`.

# Bounding box

The **bounding box** of an element is the smallest possible rectangle (aligned with the axes of that element's user coordinate system) that entirely encloses it and its descendants. The bounding box is the invisible rectangular box the browser places the object in when it draws the object on a page.
# Breadcrumb

A **breadcrumb**, or breadcrumb trail, is a navigational aid that is typically placed between a site's header and the main content, displaying either a hierarchy of the current page in relation to the site's structure, from top level to current page, or a list of the links the user followed to get to the current page, in the order visited.

A location breadcrumb for this document might look something like this:

[MDN](/) > [Glossary](/en-US/docs/Glossary) > Breadcrumb

Breadcrumb trails enable users to be aware of their location within a website. This type of navigation, if done correctly, helps users know where they are in a site and how they got there. They can also help a user get back to where they were before and can reduce the number of clicks needed to get to a higher-level page.

> [!NOTE]
> While there's no dedicated [semantic HTML element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics-other.html#rel-up) for breadcrumb navigation menus, the {{htmlelement("ol")}} element is commonly used to represent their hierarchical structure.

# Brotli compression

**Brotli** is a general-purpose lossless compression algorithm.
It compresses data using a combination of a modern variant of the [Lempel-Ziv coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77_and_LZ78#LZ77) LZ77 algorithm, [Huffman coding](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Huffman_coding), and second-order context modeling, providing a compression ratio comparable to the best currently available general-purpose compression methods.

Brotli provides better compression ratios than {{glossary("GZip_compression", "gzip")}}, and speeds that are comparable to [deflate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflate).
However brotli compression is slower than Gzip compression, so gzip may be a better option when compressing {{glossary("Cache", "non-cacheable")}} content.

Brotli is compatible with most modern browsers, but you may want to consider a fallback.

# Browsing context

A **browsing context** is an environment in which a browser displays a {{domxref("Document")}}.
In modern browsers, it usually is a _tab_, but it can be a _window_, a _popup_, a [web application](/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps), or even a part of a page such as a _frame_ or an _iframe_.

Each browsing context has an origin (that of the active document) and an ordered history of previously displayed documents.
Communication and resource sharing between browsing contexts is constrained, in particular between cross-origin contexts.
For example, a {{domxref("BroadcastChannel")}} can only be opened and used to communicate between same-origin contexts.

A browsing context may be part of a **browsing context group**, which is a set of **browsing contexts** that share common contexts, such as history, cookies, storage mechanisms and so on.
The browsing contexts within a group retain references to each other, and therefore, can inspect each other's global objects and post messages to each other.

By default, a document opened in a browser context group is opened in the same group, whether or not it is cross-origin or same-origin.
The {{httpheader("Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy")}} can be used to control whether the document is instead opened in its own new browsing context group and {{domxref("Window.crossOriginIsolated","cross-origin isolated","","no code")}} from other contexts (in particular cross-origin contexts).
This can mitigate the risk of cross-origin attacks and the side-channel attacks referred to as [XS-Leaks](https://xsleaks.dev/).

# Bun

**Bun** is a fast and modern {{Glossary("JavaScript")}} runtime environment designed to prioritize performance and developer tooling.

Unlike [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Deno](https://deno.com/), Bun is built on Apple's [JavaScriptCore](https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/JavaScriptCore). Notable features of Bun include:

- Drop-in Node.js replacement: almost all Node.js programs can run using Bun-equivalent commands.
- State-of-the-art JavaScript execution speed in most real-world scenarios.
- Native support for JavaScript syntax extensions like JSX and TypeScript.
- Global cache for managing package installations to minimize disk usage.
- Built-in bundler, transpiler, [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) compatible test-runner, package manager, and more built-in utilities that web developers may find useful.

# Cache

A **cache** (web cache or HTTP cache) is a component that stores HTTP responses temporarily so that it can be used for subsequent HTTP requests as long as it meets certain conditions.

## See also

- [Web cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_cache) on Wikipedia
# Cacheable

A **cacheable** response is an HTTP response that can be cached, that is stored to be retrieved and used later, saving a new request to the server. Not all HTTP responses can be cached; these are the constraints for an HTTP response to be cacheable:

- The method used in the request is _cacheable_, that is either a {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} or a {{HTTPMethod("HEAD")}} method. A response to a {{HTTPMethod("POST")}} or {{HTTPMethod("PATCH")}} request can also be cached if freshness is indicated and the {{HTTPHeader("Content-Location")}} header is set, but this is rarely implemented. For example, Firefox does not support it ([Firefox bug 109553](https://bugzil.la/109553)). Other methods, like {{HTTPMethod("PUT")}} or {{HTTPMethod("DELETE")}} are not cacheable and their result cannot be cached.
- The status code of the response is _known_ by the application caching, and is _cacheable_. The following status codes are cacheable: {{HTTPStatus("200")}}, {{HTTPStatus("203")}}, {{HTTPStatus("204")}}, {{HTTPStatus("206")}}, {{HTTPStatus("300")}}, {{HTTPStatus("301")}}, {{HTTPStatus("404")}}, {{HTTPStatus("405")}}, {{HTTPStatus("410")}}, {{HTTPStatus("414")}}, and {{HTTPStatus("501")}}.
- There are no specific headers in the response, like {{HTTPHeader("Cache-Control")}}, with values that would prohibit caching.

Note that some requests with non-cacheable responses to a specific URI may invalidate previously cached responses from the same URI. For example, a {{HTTPMethod("PUT")}} to `/pageX.html` will invalidate all cached responses to {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} or {{HTTPMethod("HEAD")}} requests to `/pageX.html`.

When both the method of the request and the status of the response are cacheable, the response to the request can be cached:

```http
GET /pageX.html HTTP/1.1
(…)

200 OK
(…)
```

The response to a {{HTTPMethod("PUT")}} request cannot be cached. Moreover, it invalidates cached data for requests to the same URI using {{HTTPMethod("HEAD")}} or {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} methods:

```http
PUT /pageX.html HTTP/1.1
(…)

200 OK
(…)
```

The presence of the {{HTTPHeader("Cache-Control")}} header with a particular value in the response can prevent caching:

```http
GET /pageX.html HTTP/1.1
(…)

200 OK
Cache-Control: no-cache
(…)
```

# CalDAV

**CalDAV** (Calendaring extensions to {{Glossary("WebDAV")}}) is a {{glossary("protocol")}} standardized by the {{Glossary("IETF")}} and used to remotely access calendar data from a {{glossary("server")}}.

# Call stack

A **call stack** is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple {{glossary("function","functions")}} — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.

- When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.
- Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.
- When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.
- If the stack takes up more space than it was assigned, a "stack overflow" error is thrown.

## Example

```js
function greeting() {
  // [1] Some code here
  sayHi();
  // [2] Some code here
}
function sayHi() {
  return "Hi!";
}

// Invoke the `greeting` function
greeting();

// [3] Some code here
```

The call stack will be empty at the very beginning, and the code above would be executed like this:

1. Ignore all functions, until it reaches the `greeting()` function invocation.
2. Add the `greeting()` function to the call stack list, and we have:

   ```plain
   - greeting
   ```

3. Execute all lines of code inside the `greeting()` function.
4. Get to the `sayHi()` function invocation.
5. Add the `sayHi()` function to the call stack list, like:

   ```plain
   - sayHi
   - greeting
   ```

6. Execute all lines of code inside the `sayHi()` function, until reaches its end.
7. Return execution to the line that invoked `sayHi()` and continue executing the rest of the `greeting()` function.
8. Delete the `sayHi()` function from our call stack list. Now the call stack looks like:

   ```plain
   - greeting
   ```

9. When everything inside the `greeting()` function has been executed, return to its invoking line to continue executing the rest of the JS code.
10. Delete the `greeting()` function from the call stack list. Once again, the call stack become empty.

In summary, then, we start with an empty Call Stack. Whenever we invoke a function, it is automatically added to the Call Stack. Once the function has executed all of its code, it is automatically removed from the Call Stack. Ultimately, the Stack is empty again.

# Callback function

A **callback function** is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

The consumer of a callback-based API writes a function that is passed into the API. The provider of the API (called the _caller_) takes the function and calls back (or executes) the function at some point inside the caller's body. The caller is responsible for passing the right parameters into the callback function. The caller may also expect a particular return value from the callback function, which is used to instruct further behavior of the caller.

There are two ways in which the callback may be called: _synchronous_ and _asynchronous_. Synchronous callbacks are called immediately after the invocation of the outer function, with no intervening asynchronous tasks, while asynchronous callbacks are called at some point later, after an {{glossary("asynchronous")}} operation has completed.

Understanding whether the callback is synchronously or asynchronously called is particularly important when analyzing side effects. Consider the following example:

```js
let value = 1;

doSomething(() => {
  value = 2;
});

console.log(value); // 1 or 2?
```

If `doSomething` calls the callback synchronously, then the last statement would log `2` because `value = 2` is synchronously executed; otherwise, if the callback is asynchronous, the last statement would log `1` because `value = 2` is only executed after the `console.log` statement.

Examples of synchronous callbacks include the callbacks passed to {{jsxref("Array.prototype.map()")}}, {{jsxref("Array.prototype.forEach()")}}, etc. Examples of asynchronous callbacks include the callbacks passed to {{domxref("Window.setTimeout", "setTimeout()")}} and {{jsxref("Promise.prototype.then()")}}. Here are example implementations of `doSomething` that call the callback synchronously and asynchronously:

```js
// Synchronous
function doSomething(callback) {
  callback();
}

// Asynchronous
function doSomething(callback) {
  setTimeout(callback, 0);
}
```

The [Using promises](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#timing) guide has more information on the timing of asynchronous callbacks.

# Camel case

**Camel case** is a way of writing phrases without spaces, where the first letter of each word is capitalized, except for the first letter of the entire compound word, which may be either upper or lower case. The name comes from the similarity of the capital letters to the humps of a camel's back. It's often stylized as "camelCase" to remind the reader of its appearance.

Camel casing is often used as a variable naming convention. The following variables are in camel case: {{domxref("console")}}, {{jsxref("encodeURIComponent")}}, {{jsxref("ArrayBuffer")}}, and {{domxref("HTMLElement")}}.

<!-- cSpell:ignore XMLHTTP -->

Note that if the phrase contains acronyms (such as `URI` and `HTML`), camel casing practices vary. Some prefer to keep all of them capitalized, such as `encodeURIComponent` above. This may sometimes lead to ambiguity with multiple consecutive acronyms, such as `XMLHTTPRequest`. Others prefer to only capitalize the first letter, as `XmlHttpRequest`. The actual global variable, {{domxref("XMLHttpRequest")}}, uses a mix of both.

When the first letter of the entire phrase is upper case, it is called _upper camel case_ or _Pascal case_. Otherwise, it is called _lower camel case_.

Camel case is the most popular convention in JavaScript, Java, and various other languages.

# Canonical order

In CSS, **canonical order** is used to refer to the order in which separate values need to be specified (or {{Glossary("parse", "parsed")}}) or are to be {{Glossary("serialization", "serialized")}} as part of a CSS property value. It is defined by the formal {{Glossary("syntax")}} of the property and normally refers to the order in which longhand values should be specified as part of a single shorthand value.

For example, {{cssxref("background")}} shorthand property values are made up of several `background-*` longhand properties. The canonical order of those longhand values is defined as

1. {{cssxref("background-image")}}
2. {{cssxref("background-position")}}
3. {{cssxref("background-size")}}
4. {{cssxref("background-repeat")}}
5. {{cssxref("background-attachment")}}
6. {{cssxref("background-origin")}}
7. {{cssxref("background-clip")}}
8. {{cssxref("background-color")}}

Furthermore, its syntax defines, that if a value for the {{cssxref("background-size")}} is given, it **must** be specified **after** the value for the {{cssxref("background-position")}}, separated by a slash. Other values may appear in any order.

# Canvas

The **canvas element** is part of [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) and allows for dynamic, [scriptable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language) [rendering](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_(computer_graphics)>) of 2D and 3D shapes and [bitmap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmap) images.

It is a low level, procedural model that updates a [bitmap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmap) and does not have a built-in [scene graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph). It provides an empty graphic zone on which specific {{Glossary("JavaScript")}} {{Glossary("API","APIs")}} can draw (such as Canvas 2D or {{Glossary("WebGL")}}).

# Card sorting

**Card sorting** is a simple technique used in {{glossary("Information architecture")}} whereby people involved in the design of a website (or other type of product) are invited to write down the content / services / features they feel the product should contain, and then organize those features into categories or groupings. This can be used for example to work out what should go on each page of a website. The name comes from the fact that often card sorting is carried out by literally writing the items to sort onto cards, and then arranging the cards into piles.

# Caret

A **caret** (sometimes called a "text cursor") is an indicator displayed on the screen to indicate where text input will be inserted.

Most user interfaces represent the caret using a thin vertical line or a character-sized box that flashes, but this can vary. This point in the text is called the **insertion point**. The word "caret" differentiates the text insertion point from the mouse cursor.

On the web, a caret is used to represent the insertion point in {{HTMLElement("input")}} and {{HTMLElement("textarea")}} elements, as well as any elements whose [`contenteditable`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/contenteditable) attribute is set, thereby allowing the contents of the element to be edited by the user.

## See also

- [Caret navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caret_navigation) on Wikipedia

### CSS related to the caret

You can set the color of the caret for a given element's editable content by setting the element's CSS {{cssxref("caret-color")}} property to the appropriate {{cssxref("&lt;color&gt;")}} value.

### HTML elements that may present a caret

These elements provide text entry fields or boxes and therefore make use of the caret.

- [`<input type="text">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/text)
- [`<input type="password">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/password)

# CDN

A **CDN** (Content Delivery Network) is a group of servers spread out over many locations. These servers store duplicate copies of data so that servers can fulfill data requests based on which servers are closest to the respective end-users. CDNs make for fast service less affected by high traffic.

CDNs are used widely for delivering stylesheets and JavaScript files (static assets) of libraries like Bootstrap, jQuery etc. Using CDN for those library files is preferable for a number of reasons:

- Serving libraries' static assets over CDN lowers the request burden on an organization's own servers.
- Most CDNs have servers all over the globe, so CDN servers may be geographically nearer to your users than your own servers. Geographical distance affects latency proportionally.
- CDNs are already configured with proper cache settings. Using a CDN saves further configuration for static assets on your own servers.

In fact, entire websites can be served from CDNs, particularly [static](/en-US/docs/Glossary/SSG) websites comprised entirely of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

There are also downsides to using CDNs, compared to self-hosting static assets:

- It introduces an additional dependency on a third-party service. If the CDN goes down, is blocked in a region, or is permanently shut down, your website will malfunction.
- It introduces an extra attack vector. Attackers can compromise the CDN and serve malicious content to your users. This necessitates countermeasures like [Subresource Integrity (SRI)](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Practical_implementation_guides/SRI).
- Contrary to popular belief, CDN may actually _reduce_ performance. By establishing connection with a third-party website, the user's browser has to go through more rounds of DNS lookup, content negotiation, and so on. In addition, modern browsers do not share cache between different origins for the same resource for privacy reasons, so the user has to download the same asset (e.g., jQuery) multiple times on different websites anyway.

# Certificate authority

A **certificate authority** (CA) is an organization that {{Glossary("Signature/Security", "signs")}} {{Glossary("Digital certificate", "digital certificates")}} and their associated {{Glossary("Key", "public keys")}}, thereby asserting that the contained information and keys are correct.

For a website digital certificate, this information minimally includes the name of the organization that requested the digital certificate (e.g., Mozilla Corporation), the site that it is for (e.g., mozilla.org), and the certificate authority.

Certificate authorities are the part of the Internet [public key infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure) that allows browsers to verify website identity and securely connect over TLS (thus HTTPS).

> [!NOTE]
> Web browsers come preloaded with a list of "root certificates". The browser can use these to reliably check that the website certificate was signed by a certificate authority that "chains back" to the root certificate (i.e., was trusted by the owner of the root certificate or an intermediate CA). Ultimately this process relies on every CA performing adequate identity checks before signing a certificate!

# Challenge-response authentication

In security protocols, a **challenge** is some data sent to the client by the server in order to generate a different response each time. Challenge-response protocols are one way to fight against {{glossary("replay attack", "replay attacks")}} where an attacker listens to the previous messages and resends them at a later time to get the same credentials as the original message.

The [HTTP authentication protocol](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Authentication) is challenge-response based, though the "Basic" protocol isn't using a real challenge (the realm is always the same).

# Character encoding

**Character encoding** defines a mapping between bytes and text. A sequence of bytes allows for different textual interpretations. By specifying a particular encoding (such as UTF-8), we specify how the sequence of bytes is to be interpreted.

For example, in HTML we normally declare a character encoding of UTF-8, using the following line:

```html
<meta charset="utf-8" />
```

This ensures that you can use characters from just about any human language in your HTML document, and they will display reliably.

# Character

A **character** is either a symbol (letter, number, punctuation) or a non-printing "control" (e.g., carriage return or soft hyphen). {{glossary("UTF-8")}} is the most common character set and includes the graphemes of the most popular human languages.

# Character reference

An {{glossary("HTML")}} **character reference** is an {{glossary("escape character", "escape sequence")}} of {{glossary("character", "characters")}} that is used to represent another character in the rendered web page.

Character references are used as replacements for characters that are reserved in HTML, such as the less-than (`<`) and greater-than (`>`) symbols used by the HTML parser to identify element {{Glossary('tag','tags')}}, or `"` or `'` within attributes, which may be enclosed by those characters.
They can also be used for invisible characters that would otherwise be impossible to type, including non-breaking spaces, control characters like left-to-right and right-to-left marks, and for characters that are hard to type on a standard keyboard.

There are three types of character references:

- **Named character references**
  - : These use a name string between an ampersand (`&`) and a semicolon (`;`) to refer to the corresponding character.
    For example, `&lt;` is used for the less-than (`<`) symbol, and `&copy;` for the copyright symbol (`©`).
    The string used for the reference is often a {{glossary("Camel case","camel-cased")}} initialization or contraction of the character name.

- **Decimal numeric character references**
  - : These references start with `&#`, followed by one or more ASCII digits representing the base-ten integer that corresponds to the character's {{glossary("Unicode")}} {{glossary("code point")}}, and ending with `;`.
    For example, the decimal character reference for `<` is `&#60;`, because the Unicode code point for the symbol is `U+0003C`, and `3C` hexadecimal is 60 in decimal.

- **Hexadecimal numeric character references**
  - : These references start with `&#x` or `&#X`, followed by one or more ASCII hex digits, representing the hexadecimal integer that corresponds to the character's Unicode code point, and ending with `;`.
    For example, the hexadecimal character reference for `<` is `&#x3C;` or `&#X3C;`, because the Unicode code point for the symbol is `U+0003C`.

A very small subset of useful named character references along with their unicode code points are listed below.

| Character | Named reference | Unicode code-point |
| --------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| &         | `&amp;`         | U+00026            |
| <         | `&lt;`          | U+0003C            |
| >         | `&gt;`          | U+0003E            |
| "         | `&quot;`        | U+00022            |
| '         | `&apos;`        | U+00027            |

# Character set

A **character set** is an encoding system to let computers know how to recognize {{Glossary("Character")}}, including letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and whitespace.

In earlier times, countries developed their own character sets due to their different languages used, such as Kanji JIS codes (e.g., Shift-JIS, EUC-JP, etc.) for Japanese, Big5 for traditional Chinese, and KOI8-R for Russian. However, {{Glossary("Unicode")}} gradually became most acceptable character set for its universal language support.

If a character set is used incorrectly (For example, Unicode for an article encoded in Big5), you may see nothing but broken characters, which are called [Mojibake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake).

# CIA

**CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)** (also called the CIA triad or AIC triad) is a model that guides an organization's policies for information security.

## See also

# Cipher

In {{glossary("cryptography")}}, a **cipher** is an algorithm that can {{glossary("encryption", "encrypt")}} {{glossary("plaintext")}} to make it unreadable, and to {{glossary("decryption", "decrypt")}} the encoded data back to plaintext again.

Ciphers were common long before the information age (e.g., [substitution ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher), [transposition ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_cipher), and [permutation ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_cipher)), but none of them were cryptographically secure except for the [one-time pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad).

In the modern age, ciphers have evolved dramatically. [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard), [RSA](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)>) and [Blowfish](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)>) are examples of ciphers that are integral part of contemporary encryption standards and systems.

Modern ciphers are designed to withstand attacks discovered through {{glossary("cryptanalysis")}}. There is no guarantee that all attack methods have been discovered, so each algorithm is [recommended for different purposes](/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto#supported_algorithms) based on known classes of attacks.

Ciphers operate either as [block ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher) on successive blocks (or buffers) of data, or as [stream ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_cipher) on a continuous data flow (often of sound or video).

Ciphers are also classified according to how their {{glossary("key", "keys")}} are handled:

- {{Glossary("Symmetric-key cryptography", "symmetric key")}} algorithms use the same key to encode and decode a message. The key also must be sent securely if the message is to stay confidential.
- {{Glossary("Public-key cryptography", "asymmetric key")}} algorithms use one key for encryption and the other for decryption.

# Cipher suite

**Cipher suite** is a combination of a key exchange algorithm, authentication method, bulk encryption {{Glossary("cipher")}}, and message authentication code.

In a crypto system like {{Glossary("TLS")}}, the client and server must agree on a cipher suite before they can begin communicating securely. A typical cipher suite looks like ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 or ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256, indicating:

- ECDHE (elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman ephemeral) for key exchange
- RSA for authentication
- AES-128 as the cipher, with Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) as the block cipher mode of operation
- SHA-256 as the hash-based message authentication code (HMAC)

# Ciphertext

In {{glossary("cryptography")}}, **ciphertext** is a scrambled message that conveys information but is not legible unless {{glossary("decryption","decrypted")}} with the right {{glossary("cipher")}} and the right secret (usually a {{glossary("key")}}), reproducing the original {{glossary("Plaintext")}}. A ciphertext's security, and therefore the secrecy of the contained information, depends on using a secure cipher and keeping the key secret.

# Class

In {{glossary("OOP","object-oriented programming")}}, a **class** defines an {{glossary("object","object's")}} characteristics. Class is a template definition of an object's {{glossary("property","properties")}} and {{glossary("method","methods")}}, the "blueprint" from which other more specific instances of the object are drawn.

# Cloud computing

**Cloud computing** refers to the on-demand delivery of a wide range of computing services such as storage, databases, networking, analytics, and intelligence via the Internet — also known as **cloud services**.

Cloud services are infrastructure, platforms, or software made available to users via the internet, hosted by third-party providers such as Google (Google Cloud Platform), Amazon AWS (Amazon Web Services), and Microsoft (Azure). Users can access cloud services through a _pay-as-you-go_ pricing model, ensuring they only pay for what they use, and without requiring any complex software set up on their own computers. This model enables faster innovation, flexible scalability, and significant cost savings.

The three main types of cloud computing are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Each type of cloud computing provides different levels of control, flexibility, and management.

- Infrastructure as a Service
  - : IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, including servers, storage, and networking, allowing users to manage their infrastructure. This gives users a high level of flexibility and control over the resources. Companies using IaaS can scale their server infrastructure rapidly without owning physical servers. Examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS EC2), Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines, and Google Compute Engine (GCE).
- Platform as a Service
  - : PaaS provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure such as servers, storage, and networking. PaaS allows developers to focus on writing code and application logic, without managing servers or operating systems. Examples include Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service, Heroku, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
- Software as a Service
  - : SaaS delivers software applications over the internet, which users can access via a web browser. The provider manages all the underlying infrastructure, platform, and data. Businesses using SaaS don't need to install or manage software locally. Instead, they can access software such as email, CRM, and collaboration tools directly from a web browser. Examples include Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Slack, GitHub, and ChatGPT.

# Cloud

The **Cloud** refers to servers located worldwide that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers.

Instead of storing data or running programs on a local computer or server, users can access cloud resources to perform tasks: this is known as {{glossary("Cloud computing")}}.

Key features of the cloud include:

- Remote Access: Data and services are accessed remotely.
- Scalability: Resources can be scaled up or down based on demand.
- Availability: Services and data are typically accessible from anywhere with internet access.

# Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

**Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** is a usability metric for websites, designed by Google as one of the [Core Web Vital](https://web.dev/articles/vitals) metrics.

It measures the extent to which users encounter unexpected layout shifts, in which elements of the page are moved in an unexpected way: that is, that are not the result of a user action like pressing a button or part of an animation.

Layout shifts may be caused, for example, by {{htmlelement("img")}} or {{htmlelement("video")}} elements that are not given `width` and `height` attributes, so the browser doesn't know how much space they will occupy until they are loaded.

The {{domxref("LayoutShift")}} interface, part of the [Performance API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API), can be used to measure individual layout shifts, which can then be used to calculate the CLS score for a web page.

# CMS

A **Content Management System (CMS)** is software that allows users to publish, organize, change, or remove various kinds of content, not only text but also embedded images, video, audio, and interactive code.

## See also

# Code point

A **code point** is a number assigned to represent an abstract character in a system for representing text (such as Unicode). In Unicode, a code point is expressed in the form "U+1234" where "1234" is the assigned number. For example, the character "A" is assigned a code point of U+0041.

Character encoding forms, such as {{glossary("UTF-8")}} and {{glossary("UTF-16")}}, determine how a Unicode code point should be encoded as a sequence of bytes. Different encoding forms may encode the same code point as different byte sequences: for example, the Cyrillic character "Ф", whose code point is U+0424, is encoded as `0xd0a4` in UTF-8 and as `0x0424` in UTF-16.

- [The Unicode Standard: Code Points and Characters](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode14.0.0/ch02.pdf#G25564)
# Code splitting

**Code splitting** is the practice of splitting the code a web application depends on — including its own code and any third-party dependencies — into separate bundles that can be loaded independently of each other.
This allows an application to load only the code it actually needs at a given point in time, and load other bundles on demand.
This approach is used to improve application performance, especially on initial load.

Code splitting is a feature supported by bundlers like [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Browserify](https://browserify.org/) which can create multiple bundles that can be dynamically loaded at runtime.

# Code unit

A **code unit** is the basic component used by a character encoding system (such as UTF-8 or UTF-16). A character encoding system uses one or more code units to encode a Unicode {{Glossary("code point")}}.

In {{glossary("UTF-8")}}, each code point is encoded using between one and four 8-bit code units.

In {{glossary("UTF-16")}}, each code point is encoded using one or two 16-bit code units.

# Color space

**Color spaces** are named organizations of colors for underlying color models of coordinate-based color arrangements. A color model defines how the components of a color (for example, the `h`, `w`, and `b` channels of an [`hwb()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hwb) color) relate to a color space. Most color spaces are three- or four- dimensional grids that represent colors. Each dimension (or axis) corresponds to a different channel. Colors can be expressed in multiple color spaces, and can be transformed from one color space to another, while still looking the same.

Color spaces categorize and define specific ranges of colors. Each color space is defined by a mathematical model and associated rule set. Each color space has a defined {{glossary("Gamut", "gamut")}}, which refers to the specific range of colors it can represent. These rules enable consistent and reproducible color representation across different devices and software.

The _sRGB_ color space (standard red, green, and blue) was created for the web, but we are no longer limited to this color space. [CSS Color Module Level 4](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-4) specifies several predefined color spaces, and [CSS Color Module Level 5](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-5/) goes further, specifying features for defining custom color spaces.

## Named color spaces

The predefined [RGB color spaces](#rgb_color_spaces) include `srgb`, `srgb-linear`, `display-p3`, `a98-rgb`, `prophoto-rgb`, and `rec2020`. The predefined [CIELAB color spaces](#cielab_color_spaces) include `lab-d50` and `lab-d65`. The predefined [XYZ color spaces](#xyz_color_spaces) include `xyz-d50`, and `xyz-d65` (and `xyz`, an alias for `xyz-d65`).

Color spaces are either [rectangular or polar](https://ericportis.com/posts/2024/okay-color-spaces/). Rectangular color spaces include `srgb`, `srgb-linear`, `display-p3`, `a98-rgb`, `prophoto-rgb`, `rec2020`, `lab`, `oklab`, `xyz-d50`, and `xyz-d65` (or `xyz`). The polar color spaces include `hsl`, `hwb`, `lch`, and `oklch`.

### RGB color spaces

RGB is a color model that represents colors as mixtures of three underlying components — red, green, and blue color channels — that create various hues when combined. sRGB, or "Standard RGB", is the underlying color space for {{Glossary("RGB")}} colors. sRGB is intended to codify the display specification of PC and the {{glossary("world wide web", "Web")}} based imaging systems. It is now usually the assumed color space for those without tagged or without an embedded color profile.

There are several RGB color spaces, like the _Adobe RGB_ color space, that can represent a wider {{glossary("gamut")}} of color than the _sRGB_ color space. The coordinates in _sRGB_ and _Adobe RGB_ (`a98-rgb`) are different. There are many ways to describe the RGB components of a color. In {{Glossary("CSS")}} they can be represented as a single 24-bit integer in hexadecimal notation (for example, `#add8e6` is light blue), or in [`rgb()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/rgb) functional notation as three separate numbers between 0 and 255 (for example, `rgb(46 139.5 87)`).

CSS `<color>` values in the sRGB color spaces include {{cssxref("hex-color")}}, {{cssxref("named-color")}}, {{cssxref("color_value/rgb", "rgb()")}}, {{cssxref("color_value/hsl", "hsl()")}} (hue, saturation, lightness), and {{cssxref("color_value/hwb", "hwb()")}} (hue, whiteness, blackness). There are also the `srgb`, `srgb-linear`, `a98-rgb`, and `prophoto-rgb` color spaces for the [`color()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/color) function.

The HSV (hue, saturation, and value) color space, and its synonym HSB (hue, saturation, and brightness), are represented in CSS as [`hwb()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hwb). Named colors are simply keywords mapped to specific hex values. Converting these various color notations to sRGB is straightforward mathematically. Note that {{cssxref("&lt;color&gt;","currentColor","#currentcolor_keyword")}} can be any color — it is not restricted to sRGB.

The `rgb()` color function is not the only color function that can represent the _sRGB_ color space. Cylindrical coordinate systems like the [`HSL`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl) (_hue-saturation-lightness_) or [`HWB`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hwb) (_hue-whiteness-blackness_) color models are also used to represent a sRGB color on the web.

- `srgb` color space
  - : The sRGB color space, or "Standard RGB", is the standard RGB (red, green, blue) color space. It was created to be used on monitors, printers, and the Web. It is the most widely used color space and is supported by most operating systems, software programs, monitors, and printers. sRGB is based on `r`, `g`, and `b`, with in-gamut values ranging from `0` to `1`. The whitepoint is D65.

- `srgb-linear` color space
  - : The predefined linear-light sRGB color space, `srgb-linear`, is the same as `srgb` except that the transfer function is linear-light with no gamma-encoding. The `srgb-linear` color space accepts the three `r`, `g`, and `b` values as numeric parameters, with in-gamut colors ranging from `0` to `1`. The whitepoint is D65.

- `display-p3` color space
  - : Defined by Apple, the [**Display P3**](https://www.color.org/chardata/rgb/DisplayP3.xalter), color space combines the DCI-P3 color gamut, the D65 whitepoint, and sRGB gamma curve. It is a wide gamut space typical of current wide-gamut monitors, enabling more vibrant greens and reds than the sRGB color gamut. The `display-p3` is based on `r`, `g`, and `b`, with in-gamut values ranging from `0` to `1`. The whitepoint is D65.

- `a98-rgb` color space
  - : `a98-rgb` is the Adobe® 1998 RGB color space designed to represent all the CMYK colors as RGB. About 50% of the visible colors specified by the [CIELab color space](#cielab_color_spaces) can be achieved, encompassing more cyan-green hues than other RGB color spaces. In-gamut `r`, `g`, and `b` values range from `0` to `1`. The transfer curve is a gamma function, close to but not exactly 1/2.2. The whitepoint is D65.

- `prophoto-rgb`
  - : Developed by Kodak, the `prophoto-rgb` color space can represent all the colors likely to occur in nature and about 90% of [CIElab colors](#cielab_color_spaces). In-gamut `r`, `g`, and `b` values range from `0` to `1`. The transfer curve is a gamma function, with a value of 1/1.8, and a small linear portion near black. The whitepoint is D50, the same one used by CIELab.

- `rec2020`
  - : `rec2020` is a broadcast industry standard for ultra-high definition 4k and 8k televisions. The ultra-wide gamut space is capable of representing almost all visible real-world colors, beyond the capabilities of most current displays. Coverage is expected to increase over time as displays improve. In-gamut `r`, `g`, and `b` values range from `0` to `1`. The whitepoint is D65.

> [!NOTE]
> Additional cylindrical RGB spaces that are not in the CSS specification include: `HSI` (hue, saturation, and intensity), `Okhsv`, `Okhsl`, `HSLuv`, `HPLuv`, and `Cubehelix`.

### CIELAB color spaces

The CIELAB (or CIELab) color space, also referred to as L\*a\*b* (or Lab* for short), represents the entire range of color that humans can see. This color space was defined by International Commission on Illumination (CIE). It expresses color as three values: L\* for perceptual lightness, and a\* and b\* for the four unique colors of human vision: red, green, blue, and yellow.

Lab is a rectangular coordinate system, with a central lightness `L` axis. Positive values along the `a` axis are a purplish red while negative values are the complement: green. Positive values along the `b` axis are yellow and negative are blue/violet. Desaturated colors have small values for `a` and `b` with greater absolute values being more saturated.

CIELab color functions include {{CSSXref("color_value/lab", "lab()")}} (lightness, a-axis, b-axis) and {{CSSXref("color_value/lch", "lch()")}} (lightness, chroma, hue) as well as {{CSSXref("color_value/oklab", "oklab()")}} and {{CSSXref("color_value/oklch", "oklch()")}}. The lightness values are the same, but `lch()` and `oklch` are polar, cylindrical coordinate systems, that use polar coordinates `C` (chroma) and `H` (hue) rather than axes.

> [!NOTE]
> The hue and lightness in `lch()` and `oklch` are different from the same-named values in {{cssxref("color_value/hsl", "hsl()")}} or other sRGB color spaces.

CIELab color spaces, including Lab, LCH, Oklab, and OkLCh, are device-independent color spaces.

- `lab-d50` color space
  - : Expresses color as `L` in a range from `0` to `100`, and `a` and `b` with a range from `-125` to `125`. The `a` and `b` axes are not bound by these range values, which are references in defining percentage inputs and outputs in relation to the `Display P3` color space. The whitepoint is D50.

- `lab-d65` color space
  - : This color space is the same as `lab-d50`, except that the whitepoint is D65.

- `oklab` color space
  - : Similar to `lab-d65`, but the range for `L` is `0` to `1`, and `a` and `b` range from `-0.4` to `0.4`.

### XYZ color spaces

While combinations of red, green, and blue work well for representing colors on screen, sRGB doesn't directly correspond to how humans perceive color. Created by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) in 1931, the CIE 1931 XYZ (or XYZ for short) color spaces are the first defined quantitative links between distributions of wavelengths in the electromagnetic visible spectrum and perceived colors in human vision.

People with normal vision have three kinds of cone cells that sense light, having peaks of spectral sensitivity in differing wavelengths. The CIE X, Y, and Z parameters correspond to levels of stimuli of the three kinds of cone cells which, in principle, describe every visible color. The `Y` channel represents the luminance of a color. The `Z` channel reflects the amount of blue in the color but is not the same as the `B` in RGB. The `X` axis is orthogonal to the Y- and Z- axis of the XYZ color 3D coordinate system.

- `xyz` and `xyz-d65` color space
  - : The `xyz` identifier is a synonym for the `xyz-d65` color space. The axes are not limited to a `0` to `1` range as the color space is not bound to this range; these values are only used as reference points in defining percentage inputs and outputs. The whitepoint is D65.

- `xyz-d50` color space
  - : `xyz-d50` is the same as `xyz-d65` except it uses D50 as the whitepoint.

# Color wheel

A **color wheel**, or a _color circle_, represents a palette of colors in chart form, arranged in a circle. A color wheel can display colors identified by two polar coordinates, the _angle_ and the _distance_ from the origin, the circle's center.

Color wheels are convenient for comparing colors expressed in polar or cylindrical coordinates, like [`hsl()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl), [`hwb()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hwb), or [`lch()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/lch).

In such cases, _complementary colors_ are often found opposite on the same diameter. Similarly, _monochromatic colors_ – colors of the same _tone_ but of different _shades_ – are located on the same radius, and _triadic colors_ – three colors evenly spaced around the color wheel that lead to colors that work well together – are also easy to find.

Color wheels are used in real life when we want to choose between different hues. For example, when selecting wall paint or the color for a piece of furniture.

In the digital world, color wheels are used in _color pickers_, like the default one on macOS:

# Compile

**Compiling** is the process of transforming a computer program written in a given {{Glossary("computer programming", "language")}} into a set of instructions in another format or language. A **compiler** is a computer program to execute that task.

Typically, a compiler transforms code written in a higher-level language such as [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++), [Rust](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)>), or [Java](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)>) into executable (runnable) code — so-called **binary code** or **machine code**. [WebAssembly](/en-US/docs/WebAssembly), for example, is a form of executable binary code that [can be compiled from code written in C++, Rust, C#, Go, Swift, and several other languages](https://webassembly.org/getting-started/developers-guide/) and run on any web page, with most features supported in modern browsers (see [browser compatibility table](/en-US/docs/WebAssembly#browser_compatibility)).

Most compilers perform either ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation or {{glossary("Just In Time Compilation", "just-in-time (JIT)")}} compilation.

The GNU `gcc` compiler is one well-known example of an AOT compiler. AOT compilers are typically invoked from the command line in a shell environment (from within a terminal or console) or within an {{Glossary("IDE")}}.

JIT compilers are typically not invoked directly but are instead built into software runtimes internally, for the purpose of improving performance. For example, all major browsers now use JavaScript engines that have built-in JIT compilers.

Compilers may also translate among higher-level languages — for example, from TypeScript to {{Glossary("JavaScript")}} — in which case, they are often sometimes referred to as **transpilers**.

# Composite operation

In CSS, the value of a property in a CSS rule is the _underlying value_ of that property, and the value of that same property in a [keyframe](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes) is its _effect value_.

**Composite operation** is the specific operation that is used to combine an effect value with an underlying value to produce the final keyframe effect value. There are three types of composite operations:

- **replace**: The effect value replaces the underlying value. The final effect value in this case is the original effect value itself.
- **add**: The effect value is added to the underlying value.
- **accumulate**: The effect value is combined with the underlying value.

> [!NOTE]
> Composite operation in CSS only applies to animations.

# Compression Dictionary Transport

**Compression Dictionary Transport** is a way of using a shared compression dictionary, rather than the standard static dictionary in {{glossary("Brotli compression")}} or {{glossary("Zstandard compression")}}, to dramatically reduce the transport size of HTTP responses.

For example, when downloading `app.v2.js`, if the client already has `app.v1.js` then they can reference text from that by using it as a dictionary and effectively only download the delta and a small amount of references to the `v1` file.

See the [Compression Dictionary Transport guide](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Compression_dictionary_transport) for more information.

# Computer programming

**Computer programming** is the process of composing and organizing a collection of instructions. These tell a computer/software program what to do in a language which the computer understands. These instructions come in the form of many different languages such as C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, Python, Ruby, and Rust.

Using an appropriate language, you can program/create all sorts of software. For example, a program that helps scientists with complex calculations, a database that stores huge amounts of data, a website that allows people to download music, or animation software that allows people to create animated movies.

# Conditional

A **condition** is a set of rules that can interrupt normal code execution or change it, depending on whether the condition is completed or not.

An instruction or a set of instructions is executed if a specific condition is fulfilled. Otherwise, another instruction is executed. It is also possible to repeat the execution of an instruction, or set of instructions, while a condition is not yet fulfilled.

- [Conditional](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_(computer_programming)>) on Wikipedia
# Constant

A **constant** is a value that the programmer cannot change, for example numbers (1, 2, 42). With {{glossary("variable","variables")}}, on the other hand, the programmer can assign a new {{glossary("value")}} to a variable name already in use.

Like variables, some constants are bound to identifiers. For example, the identifier `pi` could be bound to the value 3.14….

# Constructor

A **constructor** is a specialized {{glossary("function")}} that generates {{glossary("object", "objects")}} with the same shape and behavior. The constructor initializes this object with some data specific to the object. The concept of a constructor can be applied to most {{glossary("OOP","object-oriented programming")}} languages.

In {{glossary("JavaScript")}}, a constructor is usually declared within a [class](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes), but it can also be declared as a [function](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions). In fact, any function that can be called with the [`new`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new) operator is a constructor.

# Content header

**Content headers** are the group of [HTTP headers](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers) that describe the content of the body of an HTTP message, after any message framing in the body has been removed.
They specifically describe the properties of the {{Glossary("HTTP Content", "message content")}} that is conveyed in a particular message _as it is transported_, such as the length of the content, the transport encoding, which part of the resource is carried in the data (for multi-part messages), and message integrity checks.
They differ from the {{Glossary("Representation header", "Representation headers")}}, which describe the encoding, media type, language, and other characteristics of the resource, and allow the underlying data to be interpreted.

These headers were defined as "Payload headers" in {{RFC("7231")}}, but are now referred to as "Content headers" because data contained in HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 frame payloads could be header data, body data, or other control information.
Later HTTP specifications don't mention "content headers" or expand on the list of relevant headers, but the semantics remain the same, so this way of classifying headers is still useful.

> [!NOTE]
> There is some overlap between content headers and {{Glossary("Representation header", "representation headers")}}.

These headers may be present in both HTTP request and response messages and include:

- {{HTTPHeader("Content-Encoding")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Content-Length")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Content-Range")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Content-Type")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Trailer")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Transfer-Encoding")}}

# Continuous integration

Continuous integration (CI) is a software development practice in which changes to the source are frequently integrated into the main codebase.

It's an important practice whenever a team of developers is working on a shared codebase. In this situation, different developers might be making overlapping changes to the code at the same time, each in their personal branches. Frequent integration of each developer's changes makes it much less likely that conflicts will occur, and much easier to resolve them when they do.

As [Martin Fowler observes](https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html#EveryonePushesCommitsToTheMainlineEveryDay):

> Integration is primarily about communication. Integration allows developers to tell other developers about the changes they have made. Frequent communication allows people to know quickly as changes develop.

A major aspect of CI is automated build and test: typically, in a CI system, as soon as a developer opens a pull request to commit their changes to the main branch, an automated process builds the product and runs tests. Once all the tests pass, the change can be peer-reviewed.
# Continuous media

**Continuous media** is data where there is a timing relationship between source and destination. The most common examples of continuous media are audio and motion video. Continuous media can be real-time (interactive), where there is a "tight" timing relationship between source and sink, or streaming (playback), where the relationship is less strict.

CSS can be used in a variety of contexts, including print media. And some CSS, particularly those that are used for layout, behave differently depending on the context they are in.

Continuous Media, therefore, identifies a context where the content is not broken up. It flows continuously. Web content displayed on a screen is continuous media, as is spoken content.
# Control flow

**Control flow** is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.

For example, imagine a script used to validate user data from a webpage form. The script submits validated data, but if the user, say, leaves a required field empty, the script prompts them to fill it in. To do this, the script uses a {{Glossary("Conditional", "conditional")}} structure or `if...else`, so that different code executes depending on whether the form is complete or not:

```js
if (isEmpty(field)) {
  promptUser();
} else {
  submitForm();
}
```

A typical script in {{glossary("JavaScript")}} or {{glossary("PHP")}} (and the like) includes many control structures, including conditionals, {{Glossary("Loop", "loops")}} and {{Glossary("Function", "functions")}}. Parts of a script may also be set to execute when {{Glossary("Event", "events")}} occur.

For example, the above excerpt might be inside a function that runs when the user clicks the **Submit** button for the form. The function could also include a loop, which iterates through all of the fields in the form, checking each one in turn. Looking back at the code in the `if` and `else` sections, the lines `promptUser` and `submitForm` could also be calls to other functions in the script. As you can see, control structures can dictate complex flows of processing even with only a few lines of code.

Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

# Cookie

A **cookie** is a small piece of information left on a visitor's computer by a website, via a web browser.

Cookies are used to personalize a user's web experience with a website. It may contain the user's preferences or inputs when accessing that website. A user can customize their web browser to accept, reject, or delete cookies.

Cookies can be set and modified at the server level using the `Set-Cookie` [HTTP header](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Cookies), or with JavaScript using [`document.cookie`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/cookie).

# Copyleft

**Copyleft** is a term, usually referring to a license, used to indicate that such license requires that redistribution of said work is subject to the same license as the original. Examples of copyleft licenses are the GNU {{Glossary("GPL")}} (for software) and the Creative Commons SA (Share Alike) licenses (for works of art).

# CORS-safelisted request header

A [**CORS-safelisted request header**](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-safelisted-request-header) (also known as "simple header") is one of the following [HTTP headers](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers):

- {{HTTPHeader("Accept")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Accept-Language")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Content-Language")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Content-Type")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Range")}}

When containing only these headers (and values that meet the additional requirements laid out below), a request doesn't need to send a {{glossary("preflight request")}} in the context of {{Glossary("CORS")}}.

You can safelist more headers using the {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Headers")}} header and also list the above headers there to circumvent the following additional restrictions.

## Additional restrictions

CORS-safelisted headers must also fulfill the following requirements in order to be a CORS-safelisted request header:

- {{HTTPHeader("Accept-Language")}} and {{HTTPHeader("Content-Language")}} can only have values consisting of `0-9`, `A-Z`, `a-z`, space or `*,-.;=`.
- {{HTTPHeader("Accept")}} and {{HTTPHeader("Content-Type")}} can't contain a _CORS-unsafe request header byte_: `0x00-0x1F` (except for `0x09 (HT)`, which is allowed), `"():<>?@[\]{}`, and `0x7F (DEL)`.
- {{HTTPHeader("Content-Type")}} needs to have a MIME type of its parsed value (ignoring parameters) of either `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data`, or `text/plain`.
- {{HTTPHeader("Range")}} needs to have a value of a single byte range in the form of `bytes=[0-9]+-[0-9]*`.
  See the {{HTTPHeader("Range")}} header documentation for more details.
- For any header: the value's length can't be greater than 128.

# CORS-safelisted response header

A **CORS-safelisted response header** (also known as "simple response header") is an [HTTP header](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers) in a [CORS](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS) response that it is considered _safe_ to expose to client scripts. Only safelisted response headers are made available to web pages.

By default, the safelist includes the following response headers:

- {{HTTPHeader("Cache-Control")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Content-Language")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Content-Length")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Content-Type")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Expires")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Last-Modified")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Pragma")}}

Additional headers can be added to the safelist using {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Expose-Headers")}}.

## Examples

### Extending the safelist

You can extend the list of CORS-safelisted response headers by using the {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Expose-Headers")}} header:

```http
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: X-Custom-Header, Content-Encoding
```

# CORS

**CORS** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a system, consisting of transmitting {{Glossary("HTTP_header", "HTTP headers")}}, that determines whether browsers block frontend JavaScript code from accessing responses for cross-origin requests.

The [same-origin security policy](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) forbids cross-origin access to resources. But CORS gives web servers the ability to say they want to opt into allowing cross-origin access to their resources.

## CORS headers

- {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin")}}
  - : Indicates whether the response can be shared.
- {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Credentials")}}
  - : Indicates whether or not the response to the request can be exposed when the credentials flag is true.
- {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Headers")}}
  - : Used in response to a preflight request to indicate which HTTP headers can be used when making the actual request.
- {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Methods")}}
  - : Specifies the method or methods allowed when accessing the resource in response to a preflight request.
- {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Expose-Headers")}}
  - : Indicates which headers can be exposed as part of the response by listing their names.
- {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Max-Age")}}
  - : Indicates how long the results of a preflight request can be cached.
- {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Request-Headers")}}
  - : Used when issuing a preflight request to let the server know which HTTP headers will be used when the actual request is made.
- {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Request-Method")}}
  - : Used when issuing a preflight request to let the server know which [HTTP method](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods) will be used when the actual request is made.
- {{HTTPHeader("Origin")}}
  - : Indicates where a fetch originates from.
- {{HTTPHeader("Timing-Allow-Origin")}}
  - : Specifies origins that are allowed to see values of attributes retrieved via features of the [Resource Timing API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API/Resource_timing), which would otherwise be reported as zero due to cross-origin restrictions.

# Crawler

A **web crawler** is a program, often called a bot or robot, which systematically browses the {{glossary("World Wide Web","Web")}} to collect data from webpages. Typically search engines (e.g., Google, Bing, etc.) use crawlers to build indexes.

# Credential

A **credential** is an object which enables a system to make an {{glossary("authentication")}} decision: for example, to decide whether to sign a user into an account.

In web security, types of credential include:

- a password
- biometric data
- a token entered from a one-time SMS code
- the key used to make authentication assertions in a public-key system such as [Web Authentication](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API)

The [Credential Management API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Credential_Management_API) enables developers to create, store, and retrieve various types of credential.

# CRLF

**CR and LF** are [control characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_character) or [bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode) that can be used to mark a line break in a text file.

- CR = **Carriage Return** (`\r`, `0x0D` in hexadecimal, 13 in decimal) — moves the cursor to the beginning of the line without advancing to the next line.
- LF = **Line Feed** (`\n`, `0x0A` in hexadecimal, 10 in decimal) — moves the cursor down to the next line without returning to the beginning of the line.

A CR immediately followed by a LF (CRLF, `\r\n`, or `0x0D0A`) moves the cursor to the beginning of the line and then down to the next line.

# Cross-site scripting (XSS)

A **cross-site scripting** (XSS) attack is one in which an attacker is able to get a target site to execute malicious code as though it was part of the website. The code can then do anything that the site's own code can do. For example, the attacker could:

- Access and modify all the content of the site's loaded pages, and any content in local storage
- Make HTTP requests with the user's credentials, enabling them to impersonate the user or access sensitive data

All XSS attacks depend on a website doing two things:

1. Accepting some input that could have been crafted by an attacker
2. Including this input in a page without sanitizing it: that is, without ensuring that it won't be executable as JavaScript

# Cross Axis

The **cross axis** in {{glossary("flexbox")}} runs perpendicular to the {{glossary("main axis")}}, therefore if your {{cssxref("flex-direction")}} is either `row` or `row-reverse` then the cross axis runs down the columns.

![The cross axis runs down the column](basics3.png)

If your main axis is `column` or `column-reverse` then the cross axis runs along the rows.

![The cross axis runs along the row.](basics4.png)

Alignment of items on the cross axis is achieved with the `align-items` property on the flex container or `align-self` property on individual items. In the case of a multi-line flex container, with additional space on the cross axis, you can use `align-content` to control the spacing of the rows.

# CRUD

**CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) is an acronym for ways one can operate on stored data. It is a mnemonic for the four basic functions of persistent storage. CRUD typically refers to operations performed in a database or datastore, but it can also apply to higher level functions of an application such as soft deletes where data is not actually deleted but marked as deleted via a status.

# Cryptanalysis

**Cryptanalysis** is the branch of {{glossary("cryptography")}} that studies how to break codes and cryptosystems. Cryptanalysis creates techniques to break {{glossary("cipher","ciphers")}}, in particular by methods more efficient than a [brute-force search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search). In addition to traditional methods like [frequency analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis) and [index of coincidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_coincidence), cryptanalysis includes more recent methods, like [linear cryptanalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_cryptanalysis) or [differential cryptanalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_cryptanalysis), that can break more advanced ciphers.

# Cryptography

**Cryptography**, or cryptology, is the science that studies how to encode and transmit messages securely. Cryptography designs and studies algorithms used to encode and decode messages in an insecure environment, and their applications.

More than just **data confidentiality**, cryptography also tackles **identification**, **authentication**, **non-repudiation**, and **data integrity**. Therefore it also studies usage of cryptographic methods in context, **cryptosystems**.

# CSP

A **CSP** ([Content Security Policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP)) is used to detect and mitigate certain types of website related attacks like {{Glossary("Cross-site_scripting")}}, [clickjacking](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/Clickjacking) and data injections.

The implementation is based on an {{Glossary("HTTP")}} header called {{HTTPHeader("Content-Security-Policy")}}.

# Client-side rendering (CSR)

**Client-side rendering** (CSR) refers to the practice of generating HTML content using JavaScript in the browser. CSR is opposed to {{glossary("SSR", "server-side rendering")}}, where the server generates the HTML content. Both techniques are not mutually exclusive and can be used together in the same application.

A pure CSR app may return the following HTML content:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <title>My App</title>
    <script src="bundle.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <noscript>
      <p>This app requires JavaScript to run.</p>
    </noscript>
  </body>
</html>
```

Then, the actual page content is generated by JavaScript in `bundle.js`, using [DOM manipulation](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model).

Benefits of CSR include:

- Interactivity: any page update, including route transitions, do not require a full page reload. This makes the app feel faster and more responsive.
- Performance: the server only needs to send the initial HTML content and JavaScript assets. Subsequent page updates can be fetched from an API, which can be faster than fetching a full HTML page, and causes less load on the server.

Both SSR and CSR have their performance tradeoffs, and a mix of SSR and CSR can be used to combine the benefits of both techniques. For example, the server can generate a page skeleton with empty placeholders, and the client can fetch additional data and update the page as needed.

Note that {{glossary("SPA", "single-page applications")}} do not require the site to be CSR. Modern frameworks, such as [React](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Frameworks_libraries/React_getting_started), [Vue](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Frameworks_libraries/Vue_getting_started), and [Svelte](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Frameworks_libraries/Svelte_getting_started), can be used to build SPAs with SSR capabilities.

# Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)

In a **cross-site request forgery** (CSRF) attack, an attacker tricks the browser into making an HTTP request to the target site from a malicious site. The request includes the user's credentials and causes the server to carry out some harmful action, thinking that the user intended it.

A CSRF attack is possible if a website:

- Uses HTTP requests to change some state on the server
- Uses only cookies to validate that the request came from an authenticated user
- Uses only parameters in the request that an attacker can predict

There are several defenses against CSRF attacks, including [CSRF tokens](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/CSRF#csrf_tokens), using [fetch metadata](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/CSRF#fetch_metadata) to block certain cross-site requests, and [setting the `SameSite` attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/CSRF#defense_in_depth_samesite_cookies) on cookies used to authenticate sensitive requests.

# Descriptor (CSS)

A **CSS descriptor** defines the characteristics of an [at-rule](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_syntax/At-rule). At-rules may have one or multiple descriptors. Each descriptor has:

- A name
- A value, which holds the component values
- An "!important" flag, which in its default state is unset
# CSS

**CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) is a declarative language that controls how webpages look in the {{glossary("browser")}}.

The browser applies CSS style declarations to selected elements to display them properly. A style declaration contains the properties and their values, which determine how a webpage looks.

CSS is one of the three core Web technologies, along with {{Glossary("HTML")}} and {{Glossary("JavaScript")}}. CSS usually styles {{Glossary("Element","HTML elements")}}, but can be also used with other markup languages like {{Glossary("SVG")}} or {{Glossary("XML")}}.

A CSS rule is a set of {{Glossary("property/CSS","properties")}} associated with a {{Glossary("CSS selector", "selector")}}. Here is an example that makes every HTML paragraph yellow against a black background:

```css
/* The selector "p" indicates that all paragraphs in the document will be affected by that rule */
p {
  /* The "color" property defines the text color, in this case yellow. */
  color: yellow;

  /* The "background-color" property defines the background color, in this case black. */
  background-color: black;
}
```

"Cascading" refers to the rules that govern how selectors are prioritized to change a page's appearance. This is a very important feature, since a complex website can have thousands of CSS rules.

# CSS pixel

The term **CSS pixel** is synonymous with the CSS unit of absolute length _px_ — which is [normatively defined](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_and_units/Numeric_data_types#absolute_length_units) as being exactly 1/96th of 1 CSS inch (_in_).

# CSS preprocessor

A **CSS preprocessor** is a program that lets you generate {{Glossary("CSS")}} from the preprocessor's own unique {{Glossary("syntax")}}.

There are many CSS preprocessors to choose from, however most CSS preprocessors will add some features that don't exist in pure CSS, such as mixin, nesting selector, inheritance selector, and so on. These features make the CSS structure more readable and easier to maintain.

To use a CSS preprocessor, you must install a CSS compiler on your web {{Glossary("server")}}; Or use the CSS preprocessor to compile on the development environment, and then upload compiled CSS file to the web server.

## See also

- A few of most popular CSS preprocessors:
  - [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
  - [LESS](https://lesscss.org/)
  - [Stylus](https://stylus-lang.com/)

# Selector (CSS)

A **CSS selector** is the part of a CSS rule that describes what elements in a document the rule will match. The matching elements will have the rule's specified style applied to them.

## Example

Consider this CSS:

```css
p {
  color: green;
}

div.warning {
  width: 100%;
  border: 2px solid yellow;
  color: white;
  background-color: darkred;
  padding: 0.8em 0.8em 0.6em;
}

#customized {
  font:
    16px "Lucida Grande",
    "Helvetica",
    "Arial",
    sans-serif;
}
```

The selectors here are `"p"` (which applies the color green to the text inside any {{HTMLElement("p")}} element), `"div.warning"` (which makes any {{HTMLElement("div")}} element with the [class](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/class) `"warning"` look like a warning box), and `"#customized"`, which sets the base font of the element with the ID `"customized"` to 16-pixel tall Lucida Grande or one of a few fallback fonts.

We can then apply this CSS to some HTML, such as:

```html
<p>This is happy text.</p>

<div class="warning">
  Be careful! There are wizards present, and they are quick to anger!
</div>

<div id="customized">
  <p>This is happy text.</p>

  <div class="warning">
    Be careful! There are wizards present, and they are quick to anger!
  </div>
</div>
```

The resulting page content is styled like this:

{{EmbedLiveSample("Example", 640, 240)}}

# CSS Object Model (CSSOM)

The [**CSS Object Model (CSSOM)**](/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS_Object_Model) is a set of APIs for reading and modifying a document's style-related (CSS) information. In other words, similar to the way in which the [DOM](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) enables a document's structure and content to be read and modified from JavaScript, the CSSOM allows the document's styling to be read and modified from JavaScript.

# Data structure

**Data structure** is a particular way of organizing _data_ so that it can be used efficiently.

## See also

- [Data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) on Wikipedia
# Database

A **database** is a storing system that collects organized data, to make some works easier like searching, structure, and extend.

In web development, most databases use the relational database management system (RDBMS) to organize data and programming in {{glossary("SQL")}}. Some databases, however, don't follow the former mechanism to organized data, which called NoSQL.

Some famous server-side RDBMS are _MySQL_(or _MariaDB_ which is a fork of it), _SQL Server_, and _Oracle Database_. On the other hand, some famous NoSQL examples are _MongoDB_, _Cassandra_, and _Redis_.

Browsers also have their own database system called {{glossary("IndexedDB")}}.

# Debounce

**Debouncing**, in the context of programming, means to discard operations that occur too close together during a specific interval, and consolidate them into a single invocation.

Debouncing is very similar to {{glossary("throttle", "throttling")}}. The key difference is that throttling enforces limits on continuous operations, while debouncing waits for invocations to stop for a specific time to consolidate many noisy invocations into one single invocation.

A typical use case of debouncing is when responding to user input. When the user is typing, no other action should be taken to avoid the UI becoming laggy. When the user pauses typing, we can start processing the input, such as filtering results, giving suggestions, etc. If the function `search` is debounced by 10 milliseconds, it means:

1. The first call to `search` is known as the _leading edge_.
2. For every next call to `search`, if it is within 10 milliseconds from the previous call, it is in the same "batch" as the previous call.
3. After 10 milliseconds have elapsed from the last call to `search`, if no other calls have happened, we have reached the _trailing edge_.

Usually, `search` is executed once on the trailing edge only, although sometimes it might be executed on the leading edge, or even both edges, depending on the specific use case. If executed on both edges, the debouncing implementation usually also ensures that the next leading edge invocation doesn't fire at least 10 milliseconds after the previous trailing edge.

# Decryption

In {{glossary("cryptography")}}, **decryption** is the conversion of {{glossary("ciphertext")}} into {{glossary("plaintext")}}.

Decryption is an operation which transforms a ciphertext message into plaintext using a cryptographic algorithm called a {{glossary("cipher")}}. Like encryption, decryption in modern ciphers is performed by using a specific algorithm and a secret, called the {{glossary("key")}}.

![The decryption primitive.](decryption.png)

Decryption is the reverse process of {{glossary("encryption")}} and if the key stays secret, is mathematically hard to perform. How hard it is depends on how secure the cryptographic algorithm is, and that in itself is subject to change as the study of {{glossary("cryptanalysis")}} advances.

# Deep copy

A **deep copy** of an object is a copy whose properties do not share the same references (point to the same underlying values) as those of the source object from which the copy was made. As a result, when you change either the source or the copy, you can be assured you're not causing the other object to change too. That behavior contrasts with the behavior of a {{Glossary("shallow copy")}}, in which changes to nested properties in the source or the copy may cause the other object to change too.

Two objects `o1` and `o2` are _structurally equivalent_ if their observed behaviors are the same. These behaviors include:

1. The properties of `o1` and `o2` have the same names in the same order.
2. The values of their properties are structurally equivalent.
3. Their prototype chains are structurally equivalent (although when we deal with structural equivalence, these objects are usually plain objects, meaning they both inherit from `Object.prototype`).

Structurally equivalent objects can either be the same object (`o1 === o2`) or _copies_ (`o1 !== o2`). Because equivalent primitive values always compare equal, you cannot make copies of them.

We can now define deep copies more formally as:

1. They are not the same object (`o1 !== o2`).
2. The properties of `o1` and `o2` have the same names in the same order.
3. The values of their properties are deep copies of each other.
4. Their prototype chains are structurally equivalent.

Deep copies may or may not have their prototype chains copied (and often they do not). But two objects with structurally non-equivalent prototype chains (for example, one is an array and the other is a plain object) are never copies of each other.

The copy of an object whose properties all have primitive values fits the definition of both a deep copy and a {{Glossary("shallow copy")}}. It is somewhat useless to talk about the depth of such a copy, though, because it has no nested properties and we usually talk about deep copying in the context of mutating nested properties.

In JavaScript, standard built-in object-copy operations ([spread syntax](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax), [`Array.prototype.concat()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat), [`Array.prototype.slice()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice), [`Array.from()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from), and [`Object.assign()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign)) do not create deep copies (instead, they create shallow copies).

One way to make a deep copy of a JavaScript object, if it can be {{Glossary("serialization", "serialized")}}, is to use {{jsxref("JSON.stringify()")}} to convert the object to a JSON string, and then {{jsxref("JSON.parse()")}} to convert the string back into a (completely new) JavaScript object:

```js
const ingredientsList = ["noodles", { list: ["eggs", "flour", "water"] }];
const ingredientsListDeepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(ingredientsList));
```

Because a deep copy shares no references with its source object, any changes made to the deep copy do not affect the source object.

```js
// Change the value of the 'list' property in ingredientsListDeepCopy.
ingredientsListDeepCopy[1].list = ["rice flour", "water"];
// The 'list' property does not change in ingredients_list.
console.log(ingredientsList[1].list);
// Array(3) [ "eggs", "flour", "water" ]
```

However, while the object in the code above is simple enough to be {{Glossary("serialization", "serializable")}}, many JavaScript objects are not serializable at all — for example, [functions](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions) (with closures), [Symbols](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol), objects that represent HTML elements in the [HTML DOM API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_DOM_API), recursive data, and many other cases. Calling `JSON.stringify()` to serialize the objects in those cases will fail. So there's no way to make deep copies of such objects.

The web API {{DOMxRef("Window.structuredClone", "structuredClone()")}} also creates deep copies and has the advantage of allowing [transferable objects](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Transferable_objects) in the source to be _transferred_ to the new copy, rather than just cloned. It also handles more data types, such as `Error`. But note that `structuredClone()` isn't a feature of the JavaScript language itself — instead it's a feature of browsers and other JavaScript hosts that implement web APIs. And calling `structuredClone()` to clone a non-serializable object will fail in the same way that calling `JSON.stringify()` to serialize it will fail.

# Delta

The term **delta** refers to the difference between two values or states.

The name originates from the Greek letter Δ (delta), which is equivalent to the letter _D_ in the Roman alphabet. _Delta_ refers to the use of the letter Δ as a shorthand for _difference_.

The term _delta_ is commonly used when communicating changes in speed, position, or acceleration of a physical or virtual object. It's also used when describing changes in the volume or frequency of sound waves.

For example, when describing how far an object on the screen moves left-to-right, one might use the term _delta x_ or _Δx_.

Likewise, given the new value of _X_ and its old value, you might compute the delta like this:

```js
let deltaX = newX - oldX;
```

More commonly, you receive the delta and use it to update a saved previous condition:

```js
let newX = oldX + deltaX;
```

For example, mouse wheel events {{domxref("WheelEvent")}} offer the amount the wheel moved since the last event in its {{domxref("WheelEvent.deltaX", "deltaX")}}, {{domxref("WheelEvent.deltaY", "deltaY")}}, and {{domxref("WheelEvent.deltaZ", "deltaZ")}} properties.
# Denial of Service (DoS)

**Denial of Service** (DoS) is a category of network attack that consumes available {{Glossary("server")}} resources, typically by flooding the server with requests. The server is then sluggish or unavailable for legitimate users.

Computers have limited resources, for example computation power or memory. When these are exhausted, the program can freeze or crash, making it unavailable. A DoS attack consists of various techniques to exhaust these resources and make a server or a network unavailable to legitimate users, or at least make the server perform sluggishly.

There are also {{Glossary("Distributed Denial of Service", "Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)")}} attacks in which a multitude of servers are used to exhaust the computing capacity of an attacked computer.

### Types of DoS attack

DoS attacks are more of a category than a particular kind of attack. Here is a non-exhaustive list of DoS attack types:

- bandwidth attack
- service request flood
- SYN flooding attack
- ICMP flood attack
- peer-to-peer attack
- permanent DoS attack
- application level flood attack

# Deno

**Deno** is a runtime environment for {{Glossary("JavaScript")}}, {{Glossary("TypeScript")}}, and {{glossary("WebAssembly")}}.

Like {{glossary("Node.js")}}, Deno is based on the V8 JavaScript engine and enables developers to run JavaScript outside browsers. However, there are some notable differences between Node and Deno. In particular, Deno:

- Has built-in support for TypeScript.
- Restricts file system and network access by default.
- Includes a large standard library, including implementations of many Web APIs.
- Does not depend on a centralized registry, instead allowing modules to be loaded from URLs.

# Deserialization

**Deserialization** is the process whereby a lower-level format (e.g., that has been transferred over a network, or stored in a data store) is translated into a readable object or other data structure.

In {{Glossary("JavaScript")}}, for example, you can deserialize a {{Glossary("JSON")}} {{Glossary("string")}} to an object by calling the {{Glossary("function")}} {{jsxref("JSON.parse()")}}.

# Developer tools

**Developer tools** (or "development tools" or short "DevTools") are programs that allow a developer to create, test and debug software.

Current browsers provide integrated developer tools, which allow to inspect a website. They let users inspect and debug the page's {{Glossary("HTML")}}, {{Glossary("CSS")}}, and {{Glossary("JavaScript")}}, allow to inspect the network traffic it causes, make it possible to measure its performance, and much more.

# Device pixel

A **device pixel** is the smallest physical display unit capable of displaying a full color independent of its neighbor. It is the smallest physical unit of a display (such as a monitor or mobile phone screen), also known as a _hardware pixel_ or _physical pixel_. Each device pixel is an individual dot that composes the output of the display. Device pixels are fixed and do not scale based on the viewport or CSS.

A device pixel is density-dependent, varying based on the display resolution. The _device-pixel-ratio_ is the ratio of the resolution in physical device pixels to the resolution in CSS pixels for the display. It usually differs from a {{glossary("CSS pixel")}}, which is an absolute length defined as being exactly 1/96th of 1 CSS inch. Devices considered Hi-DPI have more than one device pixel per CSS pixel in the same physical area, while low-DPI devices have less than a 1-to-1 ratio.

# Digital certificate

A **digital certificate** is a data file that binds a publicly known {{Glossary("Key", "cryptographic key")}} to an organization.

A digital certificate contains information about an organization, such as the common name (e.g., mozilla.org), the organization unit (e.g., Mozilla Corporation), and the location (e.g., Mountain View). Digital certificates are most commonly signed by a {{Glossary("certificate authority")}}, attesting to the certificate's authenticity.

## See also

- [Digital certificate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate) on Wikipedia
# Digital signature

A **digital signature** is an object that can be used to {{glossary("authentication", "authenticate")}} the author of a document or message.

Digital signatures are usually based on {{glossary("public-key cryptography")}}, in which a key is created as a pair of keys, with the property that, if some input is encrypted with one key, it can only be decrypted with the other key, and vice versa.

The creator of the key pair makes one of the keys public and keeps the other one private. To sign a document, the key pair's owner creates a {{glossary("hash function", "hash")}} of the document and encrypts it with the private key.

The document and signature are sent to the verifier, who hashes the document, retrieves the public key, and decrypts the signature: if this matches the hash, then the signature has been verified, and the verifier can be confident that it was created by an entity with access to the private key.

The security of a digital signature system depends (among other things) on:

- The private key's owner keeping it safe: if other entities can access the private key, they can impersonate the owner.

- The public key used by the verifier being the genuine counterpart of the owner's private key: if an attacker could trick the verifier into trusting the wrong public key, they could impersonate the owner.

Verifiers often use {{glossary("digital certificate", "digital certificates")}} to check that public keys are genuine.

# Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

**Distributed Denial-of-Service** (DDoS) is a type of {{Glossary("Denial of Service", "DoS")}} attack in which many compromised systems are made to attack a single target, in order to swamp server resources and block legitimate users.

Normally many persons, using many bots, attack high-profile Web {{Glossary("server", "servers")}} like banks or credit-card payment gateways. DDoS concerns computer networks and CPU resource management.

In a typical DDoS attack, the assailant begins by exploiting a vulnerability in one computer system and making it the DDoS master. The attack master, also known as the botmaster, identifies and infects other vulnerable systems with malware. Eventually, the assailant instructs the controlled machines to launch an attack against a specified target.

There are two types of DDoS attacks: a network-centric attack (which overloads a service by using up bandwidth) and an application-layer attack (which overloads a service or database with application calls). The overflow of data to the target causes saturation in the target machine so that it cannot respond or responds very slowly to legitimate traffic (hence the name "denial of service"). The infected computers' owners normally don't know that their computers have been compromised, and they also suffer loss of service.

A computer under an intruder's control is called a zombie or bot. A network of co-infected computers is known as a botnet or a zombie army. Both Kaspersky Labs and Symantec have identified botnets — not spam, viruses, or worms — as the biggest threat to Internet security.

The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) defines symptoms of denial-of-service attacks to include:

- Unusually slow network performance (opening files or accessing websites)
- Unavailability of a particular website
- Inability to access any website
- Dramatic increase in the number of spam emails received—(this type of DoS attack is considered an email bomb)
- Disconnection of a wireless or wired internet connection
- Longterm denial of access to the Web or any internet services

# DMZ

A **DMZ** (DeMilitarized Zone) is a way to provide an insulated secure interface between an internal network (corporate or private) and the outside untrusted world — usually the Internet.

It exposes only certain defined endpoints, while denying access to the internal network from {{Glossary('node/networking', 'external nodes')}}.

# DNS

**DNS** (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for Internet connected resources. DNS maintains a list of {{Glossary("domain name","domain names")}} along with the resources, such as IP addresses, that are associated with them.

The most prominent function of DNS is the translation of human-friendly domain names (such as mozilla.org) to a numeric {{Glossary("IP address")}} (such as 192.0.2.172); this process of mapping a domain name to the appropriate IP address is known as a **DNS lookup**. By contrast, a **reverse DNS lookup** (rDNS) is used to determine the domain name associated with an IP address.

# Doctype

In {{Glossary("HTML")}}, the **doctype** is the required `<!doctype html>` preamble found at the top of all documents. Its sole purpose is to prevent a {{Glossary("browser")}} from switching into so-called ["quirks mode"](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Quirks_mode_and_standards_mode) when rendering a document; that is, the `<!doctype html>` doctype ensures that the browser makes a best-effort attempt at following the relevant specifications, rather than using a different rendering mode that is incompatible with some specifications.

The doctype is case-insensitive. The convention of MDN code examples is to use lowercase, but it's also common to write it as `<!DOCTYPE html>`.

In {{Glossary("CSP")}}, **document directives** are used in a {{HTTPHeader("Content-Security-Policy")}} header and govern the properties of a document or [worker](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) environment to which a policy applies.

Document directives don't fall back to the {{CSP("default-src")}} directive.

# DOM (Document Object Model)

The **DOM** (Document Object Model) is an {{glossary("API")}} that represents and interacts with any {{glossary("HTML")}} or {{glossary("XML")}}-based markup language document. The DOM is a document model loaded in the {{glossary("browser")}} and representing the document as a {{Glossary("Node/DOM","node")}} tree, or **DOM tree**, where each node represents part of the document (e.g., an {{Glossary("element")}}, text string, or comment).

The DOM is one of the most-used {{Glossary("API")}}s on the {{glossary("World Wide Web","Web")}} because it allows code running in a browser to access and interact with every node in the document. Nodes can be created, moved, and changed. Event listeners can be added to nodes and triggered on the occurrence of a given event.

# Domain

A **domain** is an authority within the internet that controls its own resources. Its "domain name" is a way to address this authority as part of the hierarchy in a {{Glossary("URL")}} - usually the most memorable part of it, for instance a brand name.

A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) contains all necessary parts to look up this authority by name unambiguously using the {{Glossary("DNS")}} system of the internet.

For example, in "developer.mozilla.org":

1. "org" is called a [top-level domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain). They are registered as an internet standard by the [IANA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority). Here, "org" means "organization" which is defined in a top-level _domain registry_.
2. "mozilla" is the domain. If you like to own a domain you have to register it with one of the many [registrars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registrar) who are allowed to do so with a top-level domain registry.
3. "developer" is a "sub-domain", something you as the owner of a domain may define yourself. Many owners choose to have a subdomain "www" to point to their {{Glossary("World_Wide_Web")}} resource, but that's not required (and has even fallen somewhat out of favor).

# Domain name

A **domain name** is a website's address on the {{Glossary("Internet")}}. Domain names are used in {{Glossary("URL","URLs")}} to identify which server a specific webpage belongs to. The domain name consists of a hierarchical sequence of names (labels) separated by periods (dots) and ending with an {{glossary("TLD","extension")}}.

# Domain sharding

Browsers limit the number of active connections for each domain. To enable concurrent downloads of assets exceeding that limit, **domain sharding** splits content across multiple subdomains. When multiple domains are used to serve multiple assets, browsers are able to download more resources simultaneously, resulting in a faster page load time and improved user experience.

The problem with domain sharding, in terms of performance, is the cost of extra DNS lookups for each domain and the overhead of establishing each TCP connection.

The initial response from an HTTP request is generally an HTML file listing other resources such as JavaScript, CSS, images and other media files that need to be downloaded. As browsers limit the number of active connections per domain, serving all the required resources from a single domain could be slow as assets need to be downloaded sequentially. With domain sharding, the required downloads are served from more than one domain, enabling the browser to simultaneously download needed resources. Multiple domains, however, is an anti-pattern, as DNS lookups slow initial load times.

HTTP2 supports unlimited concurrent requests making domain sharding an obsolete requirement when HTTP/2 is enabled.

# Dominator

In graph theory, node A **dominates** node B if every path from the root node to B passes through A.

This concept is important for {{Glossary("garbage collection")}} because it means that B is only reachable through A. So if the garbage collector found A to be unreachable and eligible for reclaiming, than B would also be unreachable and eligible for reclaiming. So objects that A dominates contribute to the retained size of A: that is, the total amount of memory that could be freed if A itself were freed.

# DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)

**DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)** is a type of broadband internet connection that sends wired data transmissions over telephone lines.

The download and upload rates don't need to be the same. In such cases, the line is said to be _asymmetrical_ and the ADSL abbreviation is used.

# DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security)

**Datagram Transport Layer Security** (**DTLS**) is a protocol used to secure datagram-based communications. It's based on the stream-focused Transport Layer Security ({{Glossary("TLS")}}), providing a similar level of security. As a datagram protocol, DTLS doesn't guarantee the order of message delivery, or even that messages will be delivered at all. However, DTLS gains the benefits of datagram protocols, too; in particular, the lower overhead and reduced latency.

These features are especially useful for one of the most common areas in which DTLS comes into play: {{Glossary("WebRTC")}}. All of the WebRTC related protocols are required to encrypt their communications using DTLS; this includes {{Glossary("SCTP")}}, {{Glossary("RTP", "SRTP")}}, and {{Glossary("STUN")}}.

# DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency signaling)

**Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency** (**DTMF**) signaling is a system by which audible tones are used to represent buttons being pressed on a keypad. Frequently referred to in the United States as "touch tone" (after the Touch-Tone trademark used when the transition from pulse dialing to DTMF began), DTMF makes it possible to signal the digits 0-9 as well as the letters "A" through "D" and the symbols "#" and "\*". Few telephone keypads include the letters, which are typically used for control signaling by the telephone network.

Computers may make use of DTMF when dialing a modem, or when sending commands to a menu system for teleconferencing or other purposes.

# ECMA

**Ecma International** (formally _European Computer Manufacturers Association_) is a non-profit organization that develops standards in computer hardware, communications, and programming languages.

On the web it is famous for being the organization which maintain [the ECMA-262 specification](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/) (aka. {{Glossary("ECMAScript")}}) which is the core specification for the {{Glossary("JavaScript")}} language.

# Effective connection type

**Effective connection type** (ECT) refers to the measured network performance, returning a cellular connection type, like 3G, even if the actual connection is tethered broadband or Wi-Fi, based on the time between the browser requesting a page and effective type of the connection.

The values of `slow-2g`, `2g`, `3g`, and `4g` are determined using observed round-trip times and downlink values.

| ECT       | Minimum {{Glossary("Round Trip Time", "RTT")}} | Maximum downlink | Explanation                                                                                              |

| `2g`      | 1400ms                                         | 70 Kbps          | The network is suited for transfers of small images.                                                     |
| `3g`      | 270ms                                          | 700 Kbps         | The network is suited for transfers of large assets such as high resolution images, audio, and SD video. |
| `4g`      | 0ms                                            | ∞                | The network is suited for HD video, real-time video, etc.                                                |

[effectiveType](/en-US/docs/Web/API/NetworkInformation/effectiveType) is a property of the [Network Information API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Network_Information_API), exposed to JavaScript via the [navigator.connection](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/connection) object. To see your effective connection type, open the console of the developer tools of a supporting browser and enter the following:

```js
navigator.connection.effectiveType;
```

# Element

An **element** is a part of a webpage. In {{glossary("XML")}} and {{glossary("HTML")}}, an element may contain a data item or a chunk of text or an image, or perhaps nothing. A typical element includes an opening tag with some {{glossary("attribute", "attributes")}}, enclosed text content, and a closing tag.

![Example: in <p class="nice">Hello world!</p>, '<p class="nice">' is an opening tag, 'class="nice"' is an attribute and its value, 'Hello world!' is enclosed text content, and '</p>' is a closing tag.](anatomy-of-an-html-element.png)

Elements and {{glossary("tag", "tags")}} are _not_ the same things. Tags begin or end an element in source code, whereas elements are part of the {{Glossary("DOM")}}, the document model for displaying the page in the {{glossary("browser")}}.

# Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the packing of data and {{glossary("function","functions")}} into one component (for example, a {{glossary("class")}}) and then controlling access to that component to make a "blackbox" out of the {{glossary("object")}}. Because of this, a user of that class only needs to know its interface (that is, the data and functions exposed outside the class), not the hidden implementation.

# Encryption

In {{glossary("cryptography")}}, **encryption** is the conversion of {{glossary("plaintext")}} into a coded text or {{glossary("ciphertext")}}. A ciphertext is intended to be unreadable by unauthorized readers.

Encryption is a cryptographic primitive: it transforms a plaintext message into a ciphertext using a cryptographic algorithm called a {{glossary("cipher")}}. Encryption in modern ciphers is performed using a specific algorithm and a secret, called the {{glossary("key")}}. Since the algorithm is often public, the key must stay secret if the encryption stays secure.

![How encryption works.](encryption.png)

Without knowing the secret, the reverse operation, {{glossary("decryption")}}, is mathematically hard to perform. How hard depends on the security of the cryptographic algorithm chosen and evolves with the progress of {{glossary("cryptanalysis")}}.
# Endianness

**Endian** and **endianness** (or "byte-order") describe how computers organize the bytes that make up numbers.

Each memory storage location has an index or address. Every byte can store an 8-bit number (i.e., between `0x00` and `0xff`), so you must reserve more than one byte to store a larger number. By far the most common _ordering_ of multiple bytes in one number is the **little-endian**, which is used on all Intel processors. Little-endian means storing bytes in order of least-to-most-significant (where the least significant byte takes the first or lowest address), comparable to a common European way of writing dates (e.g., 31 December 2050).

Naturally, **big-endian** is the opposite order, comparable to an ISO date (2050-12-31). Big-endian is also often called "network byte order", because Internet standards usually require data to be stored big-endian, starting at the standard UNIX socket level and going all the way up to standardized Web binary data structures. Also, older Mac computers using 68000-series and PowerPC microprocessors formerly used big-endian.

Examples with the number `0x12345678` (i.e., 305 419 896 in decimal):

- _little-endian_: `0x78 0x56 0x34 0x12`
- _big-endian_: `0x12 0x34 0x56 0x78`
- _mixed-endian_ (historic and very rare): `0x34 0x12 0x78 0x56`

The typed arrays guide provides an example that [converts any number to its binary representation under the given endianness](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Typed_arrays#dataview).

# Engine

The term **engine** can have several meanings depending on the context. It may refer to:

{{GlossaryDisambiguation}}
# JavaScript engine

**JavaScript engines** are interpreters that parse and execute {{glossary("JavaScript")}} code. Modern JavaScript engines use just-in-time (JIT) compilation to convert JavaScript code into machine code that can be executed by a computer's processor. A JavaScript engine is typically developed and used in web {{glossary("browser", "browsers")}} to run client-side code but can also be used in server-side environments like {{glossary("Node.js")}}.

In a browser, the JavaScript engine operates together with the rendering engine via the {{glossary("DOM", "Document Object Model")}} and {{glossary("WebIDL", "Web IDL")}} bindings. Some JavaScript engines also execute {{glossary("WebAssembly")}} code in the same sandbox as regular JavaScript code.

Do not confuse JavaScript engines with {{glossary("engine/rendering", "rendering engines")}}, which are also crucial parts of browsers.

Common JavaScript engines include:

- [V8](https://v8.dev/)
- [SpiderMonkey](https://spidermonkey.dev/)
- [JavaScriptCore](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore)

# Rendering engine

**Rendering engines** (also known as layout engines or browser engines) are part of a {{glossary("Browser", "web browser")}} that transforms {{glossary("HTML")}}, {{glossary("CSS")}}, and other resources of a web page into a visual representation on a screen.

Common rendering engines include:

- {{glossary("Blink")}}
- {{glossary("Gecko")}}
- {{glossary("WebKit")}}
- {{glossary("Trident")}}

# Entity header

> [!WARNING]
> The current HTTP/1.1 specification no longer refers to entities, entity headers or entity-body. Some of the fields are now referred to as {{glossary("Representation header")}} fields.

An entity header is an {{glossary("HTTP_header", "HTTP header")}} that describes the {{Glossary("HTTP content", "content")}} of an HTTP message (i.e., metadata about the message body). Entity headers include: {{HTTPHeader("Content-Length")}}, {{HTTPHeader("Content-Language")}}, {{HTTPHeader("Content-Encoding")}}, {{HTTPHeader("Content-Type")}}, {{HTTPHeader("Expires")}}, etc. Entity headers may be present in both HTTP request and response messages.

In the following example, {{HTTPHeader("Content-Length")}} is an entity header, while {{HTTPHeader("Host")}} and {{HTTPHeader("User-Agent")}} are requests headers:

```http
POST /my-form.html HTTP/1.1
Host: developer.mozilla.org
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.9; rv:50.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/50.0
Content-Length: 128
```

# Entity

Entity is a term from the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), which refers to a reference to information that can be defined once and used throughout a document.

The term "HTML Entity" is used as a synonym for a {{glossary("character reference")}} — a pattern of characters that can represent another character in the HTML.
For example, `&lt;` is used to represent the less-than symbol (`<`) in HTML content.
# Enumerated

In computer science, an **enumerated** type is a data type consisting of a limited set of named values.

## HTML enumerated attributes

In HTML, [enumerated attributes](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-microsyntaxes.html#enumerated-attribute) are attributes with a limited, predefined set of text values. For example, the global HTML [`dir`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/dir) attribute has three valid values: `ltr`, `rtl`, and `auto`. Like for HTML tag names, HTML enumerated attributes and their values are case-insensitive, so `LTR`, `RTL`, and `AUTO` will also work. The IDL-reflected property, {{domxref("HTMLElement.dir")}}, can also be set using a case-insensitive value, but will always return the canonical format of the value defined in the specification (lowercased values in this example). See [Attribute reflection](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Reflected_attributes) for more information.

Each enumerated attribute has a default value for when the attribute is present without a value (the value is missing), and a default value for when the attribute is assigned an invalid value. Unlike {{Glossary("Boolean/HTML", "Boolean attribute")}} HTML attributes — which are always true when the attribute is present whether the value is present, omitted, or invalid — with enumerated HTML attributes, the default for an omitted value may be different from the default for invalid values. For example, the global HTML [`contenteditable`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/contenteditable) attribute has two valid keywords: `true` and `false`. If the attribute is present but no value is set, the value is `true`. If a value is set, but is invalid, such as `contenteditable="contenteditable"`, the value maps to a third state, `inherit`.

## ARIA enumerated attributes

ARIA states and properties, being HTML, also have enumerated attributes. If an ARIA attribute includes a both a `true` and `false` value in the enumerated list, it generally treats an omitted attribute as `false` and an invalid value as `true`, while the default value for the empty string or omitted value depends on the attribute.

For example, the `aria-current` attribute accepts a limited list of values that includes `page`, `step`, `location`, `date`, `time`, `true`, and `false`. In this case, if the attribute is not present, is an empty string, is present with no value, or is set to `aria-current="false"` the attribute is false and is not exposed to the user. Any non-empty string value not in the list of enumerated values is treated as if `aria-current="true"` were set.

## JavaScript enumerable properties

In JavaScript, enumerable properties are those properties whose internal enumerable flag is set to true, which is the default for properties created via simple assignment or via a property initializer. Most iteration mechanisms (such as [`for...in`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in) loops and [`Object.keys`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys)) only visit enumerable keys.

# Escape character

An **escape character** is a {{glossary("character")}} that causes one or more characters that follow it to be interpreted differently. This forms an **escape sequence**, which is often used to represent a character that has an alternative meaning when printed literally, such as the quote character in a string literal. Escape sequences can have other usages too, especially in [regular expressions](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions#escape_sequences).

- In JavaScript [regexes](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Character_escape), [string literals](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#string_literals), and [identifiers](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#identifiers), we can use the backslash (`\`) to escape characters like `\'`, `\"`, `\u0026`, etc.
- In CSS identifiers, we can use the backslash (`\`) to escape characters like `\\`, `\n`, `\26`, etc. See [escape characters](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/ident#escaping_characters) for more information.
- In HTML text content and attribute values, we can use {{glossary("character reference", "character references")}} like `&lt;`, `&#60;`, or `&#x3C;`.
- In {{glossary("URL", "URLs")}}, we can use the percent sign (`%`) to escape characters like `%20`, `%3C`, `%3E`, etc.

# eTLD

The term **eTLD** stands for "effective top-level domain" and is a domain under which domains can be registered by a single organization.

A top level domain (TLD) is the part of the domain name following the final dot: so for example, the top-level domain in `crookedtimber.org` is `org`.

Suppose only domains directly under top-level domains were registrable by single organizations. Then you would know that the following domains all belonged to the same organization:

```plain
    xyz.org
abc.xyz.org
def.xyz.org
```

However, this does not work as a general rule, because many registrars allow organizations to register domains at levels below the top level. This means that, for example, `sussex.ac.uk` and `aber.ac.uk` are owned by different organizations.

Because this is a matter of the registrar's policies, it's impossible to tell algorithmically whether a given domain name suffix (like `ac.uk`) is publicly registrable or not. The [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/) is a list of all suffixes under which organizations can directly register names: that is, it is a list of eTLDs.

The related concept **eTLD+1** means an eTLD plus the next part of the domain name. Because eTLD+1s are registrable, all domains with the same eTLD+1 are owned by the same organization.

For example, all the following are eTLD+1 domains:

- crookedtimber.org
- theguardian.com
- sussex.ac.uk
- aber.ac.uk

This means that all domains under each of these domains belong to the same organization. For example:

```plain
 film.theguardian.com
music.theguardian.com
```

```plain
      news.sussex.ac.uk
      blog.sussex.ac.uk
admissions.sussex.ac.uk
```

# Exception

An **exception** is a condition that interrupts normal code execution. In JavaScript {{glossary("syntax error", "syntax errors")}} are a very common source of exceptions.

## See also

- [Exception handling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling) on Wikipedia
# EXIF

The **Exchangeable Image File Format (EXIF)** is a standard that specifies how metadata about a multimedia file can be embedded within the file. For example, an image might contain EXIF data describing the: pixel width, height, and density, shutter speed, aperture, ISO settings, capture date, etc.

# Expando

Expando properties are properties added to {{glossary("DOM")}} nodes with {{glossary("JavaScript")}}, where those properties are not part of the {{glossary("object","object's")}} DOM specification:

```js
window.document.foo = 5; // foo is an expando
```

The term may also be applied to properties added to objects without respecting the object's original intent, such as non-numeric named properties added to an {{glossary("Array")}}.
# Extrinsic size

In CSS, the **extrinsic size** of an element is determined by its layout context, that is, by constraints imposed from outside the element, without regard for its contents. This is the opposite of an element's {{glossary("intrinsic size")}}, which is based on its content.

Extrinsic sizing occurs when you explicitly set or constrain the size of an element using [CSS box model](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Box_model) properties such as {{cssxref("width")}}, {{cssxref("height")}}, {{cssxref("block-size")}}, {{cssxref("inline-size")}}, {{cssxref("max-width")}}, and {{cssxref("min-height")}}.
For example, when you set `width: 200px`, you're specifying an extrinsic size.

Percentage values are also extrinsic; they're calculated relative to the element's [containing block](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Containing_block).
For example, `width: 50%` means the width of the element will be `50%` of the width of its containing block, regardless of the content inside the element.

Block-level elements are sized extrinsically. When a width isn't specified, the block element's default width is `auto`, which resolves to `100%` width of its containing block.

# Fallback alignment

In [CSS Box Alignment](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_box_alignment), a fallback alignment is specified in order to deal with cases where the requested alignment cannot be fulfilled. For example, if you specify `justify-content: space-between` there must be more than one {{Glossary("alignment subject")}}. If there is not, the fallback alignment is used. This is specified per alignment method, as detailed below.

- First baseline
  - : `start`
- Last baseline
  - : `safe end`
- Baseline
  - : `start`
- Space-between
  - : `flex-start` (start)
- Space-around
  - : `center`
- Space-evenly
  - : `center`
- Stretch
  - : `flex-start` (start)

# Falsy

<!-- cSpell:ignore falsey -->

A **falsy** (sometimes written **falsey**) value is a value that is considered false when encountered in a {{Glossary("Boolean")}} context.

{{Glossary("JavaScript")}} uses {{Glossary("Type_Conversion", "type conversion")}} to coerce any value to a Boolean in contexts that require it, such as {{Glossary("Conditional", "conditionals")}} and {{Glossary("Loop", "loops")}}.

The following table provides a complete list of JavaScript falsy values:

| Value                       | Type      | Description                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| {{Glossary("null")}}        | Null      | The keyword [`null`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/null) — the absence of any value.                                               |
| {{Glossary("undefined")}}   | Undefined | [`undefined`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined) — the primitive value.                                                 |
| `false`                     | Boolean   | The keyword [`false`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#reserved_words).                                                         |
| {{Glossary("NaN")}}         | Number    | [`NaN`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NaN) — not a number.                                                                    |
| `0`                         | Number    | The {{jsxref("Number")}} zero, also including `0.0`, `0x0`, etc.                                                                                    |
| `-0`                        | Number    | The {{jsxref("Number")}} negative zero, also including `-0.0`, `-0x0`, etc.                                                                         |
| `0n`                        | BigInt    | The {{jsxref("BigInt")}} zero, also including `0x0n`, etc. Note that there is no {{jsxref("BigInt")}} negative zero — the negation of `0n` is `0n`. |
| `""`                        | String    | Empty [string](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) value, also including `''` and ` `` `.                                   |
| {{domxref("document.all")}} | Object    | The only falsy object in JavaScript is the built-in {{domxref("document.all")}}.                                                                    |

The values `null` and `undefined` are also {{Glossary("nullish")}}.

## Examples

Examples of _falsy_ values in JavaScript (which are coerced to false in Boolean contexts, and thus _bypass_ the `if` block):

```js
if (false) {
  // Not reachable
}

if (null) {
  // Not reachable
}

if (undefined) {
  // Not reachable
}

if (0) {
  // Not reachable
}

if (-0) {
  // Not reachable
}

if (0n) {
  // Not reachable
}

if (NaN) {
  // Not reachable
}

if ("") {
  // Not reachable
}
```

### The logical AND operator, &&

If the first object is falsy, it returns that object:

```js
console.log(false && "dog");
// ↪ false

console.log(0 && "dog");
// ↪ 0
```

# Favicon

A favicon (favorite icon) is a tiny icon included along with a website, which is displayed in places like the browser's address bar, page tabs and bookmarks menu.

Note, however, that most modern browsers replaced the favicon from the address bar by an image indicating whether or not the website is using {{Glossary("HTTPS")}}.

Usually, a favicon is 16 x 16 pixels in size and stored in the {{Glossary("GIF")}}, {{Glossary("PNG")}}, or ICO file format.

They are used to improve user experience and enforce brand consistency. When a familiar icon is seen in the browser's address bar, for example, it helps users know they are in the right place.

# Federated identity

A **federated identity** system is one in which an {{glossary("identity provider", "identity provider (IdP)")}} acts as an intermediary between users and {{glossary("relying party", "relying parties")}}, enabling a user to use a single set of {{glossary("credential", "credentials")}} to authenticate with a number of different relying parties.

Traditionally, on the web, a user will sign into a website with a username and a password, and the password is verified by the website against a (properly {{glossary("hash function", "hashed")}} and {{glossary("salt", "salted")}}) copy stored on the website's backend.

In this model, if users have multiple accounts with different websites, they have to remember many passwords, and this encourages bad password practices such as using the same password for multiple accounts.

In a federated identity system, an identity provider:

- manages a user's credentials and can authenticate users
- is trusted by multiple websites to make assertions about a user's identity.

A user can then authenticate with the identity provider, which will return a token to the user's browser if authentication is successful. The user's browser will send the token to the website, which can verify that it was issued by the IdP. If the verification succeeds, the website can sign the user in.

Federated identity is often provided as a service by corporations: for example, users who have Google, Microsoft, or Facebook accounts can use them to sign in to many websites. Websites typically have to implement a process for verifying tokens that is specific to an identity provider. However, open standards such as [OpenID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID), [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth), and [SAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language) are widely used in the implementation of federated identity systems.

Although federated identity makes logging into multiple different accounts much easier for users and can greatly improve security, it can have serious implications for a user's privacy. If not carefully designed, a federated identity system can allow identity providers to track users across the web as they sign into multiple different sites. Early federated identity systems on the web were built on technologies such as third-party cookies, which are intrinsically privacy-invasive. As these technologies are being deprecated by browsers, new approaches are needed. The [Federated Credential Management (FedCM) API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/FedCM_API) provides a standardized privacy-preserving mechanism for federated identity on the web.

# Fetch directive

**{{Glossary("CSP")}} fetch directives** are used in a {{HTTPHeader("Content-Security-Policy")}} header and control locations from which certain resource types may be loaded. For instance, {{CSP("script-src")}} allows developers to allow trusted sources of script to execute on a page, while {{CSP("font-src")}} controls the sources of web fonts.

All fetch directives fall back to {{CSP("default-src")}}. That means, if a fetch directive is absent in the CSP header, the user agent will look for the `default-src` directive.

See [Fetch directives](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy#fetch_directives) for a complete list.

# Fetch metadata request header

A **fetch metadata request header** is an {{Glossary("Request header", "HTTP request header")}} that provides additional information about the context from which the request originated. This allows the server to make decisions about whether a request should be allowed based on where the request came from and how the resource will be used.

With this information a server can implement a resource isolation policy, allowing external sites to request only those resources that are intended for sharing, and that are used appropriately. This approach can help mitigate common cross-site web vulnerabilities such as {{Glossary("CSRF")}}, Cross-site Script Inclusion (XSSI), timing attacks, and cross-origin information leaks.

These headers are prefixed with `Sec-`, and hence are {{Glossary("Forbidden request header", "forbidden request headers")}}. As such, they cannot be modified from JavaScript.

The fetch metadata request headers are:

- {{HTTPHeader("Sec-Fetch-Site")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Sec-Fetch-Mode")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Sec-Fetch-User")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Sec-Fetch-Dest")}}

The following request headers are not _strictly_ "fetch metadata request headers", as they are not in the same specification, but similarly provide information about the context of how a resource will be used.
A server might use them to modify its caching behavior, or the information that is returned:

- {{HTTPHeader("Sec-Purpose")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Service-Worker-Navigation-Preload")}}

# Fingerprinting

**Fingerprinting** is a practice in which websites identify a particular browser (and by extension, a particular user) by collecting and combining distinguishing features of the browser and underlying operating system. Elements of a fingerprint might include, for example:

- the browser version
- the timezone and preferred language
- the set of video or audio codecs that are available on the system
- the fonts installed on the system
- the state of the browser's settings
- the computer's display size and resolution

A website can retrieve information like this by executing JavaScript and CSS on the device, and by combining this data can often create a unique fingerprint for a browser, which can then be used to track users across the web.

Web standards are designed in such a way as to minimize the ability of a website to collect identifying information, and browsers typically add their own protections as well.

# Firefox OS

Firefox OS is a discontinued open source mobile operating system developed by Mozilla. See [Firefox OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_OS) for more details.

Firefox OS was also often called Boot2Gecko before the project had an official name.
# Firewall

A **firewall** is a system that filters network traffic. It can either let it pass or block it, according to some specified rules. For example, it can block incoming connections aimed at a certain port or outgoing connections to a certain IP address.

Firewalls can be as simple as a single piece of software, or more complex, like a dedicated machine whose only function is to act as a firewall.

# First-class function

A programming language is said to have **First-class functions** when functions in that language are treated like any other variable. For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.

## Examples

### Assigning a function to a variable

```js
const foo = () => {
  console.log("foobar");
};
foo(); // Invoke it using the variable
// foobar
```

We assigned an _Anonymous Function_ to a {{glossary("Variable")}}, then we used that variable to invoke the function by adding parentheses `()` at the end.

> [!NOTE]
> Even if your function was named, you can use the variable name to invoke it. Naming it will be helpful when debugging your code. _But it won't affect the way we invoke it._

### Passing a function as an argument

```js
function sayHello() {
  return "Hello, ";
}
function greeting(helloMessage, name) {
  console.log(helloMessage() + name);
}
// Pass `sayHello` as an argument to `greeting` function
greeting(sayHello, "JavaScript!");
// Hello, JavaScript!
```

We are passing our `sayHello()` function as an argument to the `greeting()` function, this explains how we are treating the function as a value.

> [!NOTE]
> The function that we pass as an argument to another function is called a _{{glossary("callback function")}}_. _`sayHello()` is a callback function._

### Returning a function

```js
function sayHello() {
  return () => {
    console.log("Hello!");
  };
}
```

In this example, we are returning a function from another function - _We can return a function because functions in JavaScript are treated as values._

> [!NOTE]
> A function that returns a function or takes other functions as arguments is called a _higher-order function_.

# First Contentful Paint (FCP)

**First Contentful Paint** (FCP) is when the browser renders the first content from the DOM, providing feedback to the user that the page is loading. Completing the first contentful paint answers the question "Is it happening?"

_The First Contentful Paint_ timestamp is when the browser first rendered any text, image (including background images), video, canvas that had been drawn into, or non-empty SVG. This excludes any content of iframes, but includes text with pending webfonts. This is the first time users could start consuming page content.

# First CPU idle

**First CPU Idle** measures when a page is minimally interactive, or when the window is quiet enough to handle user input. It is a non-standard Google web performance metric. Generally, it occurs when most, but not necessarily all visible UI elements are interactive, and the user interface responds, on average, to most user input within 50ms.

# First Input Delay (FID)

**First input delay** (FID) measures the time from when a user first interacts with your site (for example, when they click a link, tap on a button, or use a custom, JavaScript-powered control) to the time when the browser is actually able to respond to that interaction.

> [!WARNING]
> FID was designed by Google as one of the [Core Web Vital](https://web.dev/articles/vitals) metrics but was replaced by {{Glossary("Interaction to Next Paint")}} (INP) [in May 2024](https://web.dev/blog/inp-cwv-launch).

It is the length of time, in milliseconds, between the first user interaction on a web page and the browser's response to that interaction. Scrolling and zooming are not included in this metric.

The time between when content is painted to the page and when all the functionality becomes responsive to human interaction often varies based on the size and complexity of the JavaScript needing to be downloaded, parsed, and executed on the main thread, and on the device speed or lack thereof (think low end mobile devices). The longer the delay, the worse the user experience. Reducing site initialization time and eliminating [long tasks](/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceLongTaskTiming) can help eliminate first input delays.

# First Meaningful Paint (FMP)

**First Meaningful Paint** (FMP) is the paint after which the biggest above-the-fold layout change has happened and web fonts have loaded. It is when the answer to "Is it useful?" becomes "yes", upon first meaningful paint completion.

FMP is very sensitive to small differences in the page load. This can lead to inconsistent (bimodal) results. The metric's definition relies on browser-specific implementation details, which means it can't be standardized and has not been implemented in all web browsers.

> [!WARNING]
> First Meaningful Paint (FMP) is deprecated in Lighthouse 6.0. Moving forward, consider using the [LargestContentfulPaint API](https://wicg.github.io/largest-contentful-paint/) instead.

It is the first key moment in page load and will answer the question "Has the browser started to render the page?"

# Flex container

A {{glossary("flexbox")}} layout is defined using the `flex` or `inline-flex` values of the `display` property on the parent item. This element then becomes a **flex container**, and each one of its children becomes a {{glossary("flex item")}}.

A value of `flex` causes the element to become a block level flex container, and `inline-flex` an inline level flex container. These values create a **flex formatting context** for the element, which is similar to a block formatting context in that floats will not intrude into the container, and the margins on the container will not collapse with those of the items.

# Flex

`flex` is a value of the CSS {{cssxref("display")}} property. Along with `inline-flex`, it causes the element it applies to become a {{glossary("flex container")}}, and the element's children to each become a {{glossary("flex item")}}. The items then participate in flex layout, and all of the properties defined in the [CSS flexible box layout module](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout) may be applied.

There is also a {{cssxref("flex")}} property, which is a shorthand for the flexbox properties {{cssxref("flex-grow")}}, {{cssxref("flex-shrink")}} and {{cssxref("flex-basis")}}. This property is only applicable to flex containers.

In addition [`<flex>`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex_value) can refer to a [flexible length](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex_value) in CSS Grid Layout.

# Flexbox

Flexbox is the commonly-used name for the [CSS flexible box layout module](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout), a layout model for displaying items in a single dimension — as a row or as a column.

In the specification, flexbox is described as a layout model for user interface design. The key feature of flexbox is that items in a flex layout can grow and shrink. Space can be assigned to the items themselves, or distributed between or around the items.

Flexbox also enables alignment of items on the main or cross axis, thus providing a high level of control over the size and alignment of a group of items.

# Flow relative values

In CSS, **flow relative values** are directional keyword values relative to an element's block and inline axes. These values include `block-start`, `block-end`, `inline-start`, `inline-end`, `start`, and `end`.

In CSS, {{glossary("physical properties")}} define positions based on physical directions and reference specific sides of an element.

CSS {{glossary("logical properties")}} on the other hand define styles based on the document's writing mode and direction rather than the physical dimensions of the viewport. Logical properties are relative to the content flow and use directional keywords relative to the block and inline axes.

## Block direction

The **block axis** refers to the axis that defines the stacking order of elements in a block layout. It's essentially the direction along which blocks of content — like paragraphs ({{htmlelement("p")}}), headings, and divs ({{htmlelement("div")}}) — are laid out on a webpage. This is also known as the **block direction**. In left-to-right and right-to-left languages, the block direction is the vertical direction of the content flow, going from top to bottom.

The **block-start** and **block-end** directions represent the _start edge_ and _end edge_ of content along the block axis, or the "from" and "to" directions, respectively, with `block-start` being the equivalent of `top` and `block-end` being the equivalent of `bottom` in horizontal writing modes.

## Inline direction

The **inline axis** is perpendicular to the block axis. The inline axis represents the direction along which inline content like text flows within a block. This is also known as the **inline direction**. In left-to-right writing modes, like English, the inline direction is horizontal, left-to-right. In right-to-left languages, like Arabic and Hebrew, the inline direction is horizontal, right-to-left.

**Inline-start** and **inline-end** represent the _start edge_ and _end edge_ of content along the inline axis, respectively, with the values and properties `inline-start` and `inline-end` being the equivalent of `left` and `right` properties and values in horizontal writing modes. Whether they are equivalent to `right` or `left` depends on the writing direction. For example, `inline-start` is equivalent to `left` in left-to-right languages and `right` in right-to-left languages.

## Start and end

A CSS property's effects can be either one-dimensional or two-dimensional. For example, {{cssxref("text-align")}} concerns the inline direction of text only, so is one-dimensional. When contextually constrained to one dimension, the flow-relative keywords are abbreviated to just `start` or `end`.

# Forbidden request header

A **forbidden request header** is an [HTTP header](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers) name-value pair that cannot be set or modified programmatically in a request. For headers forbidden to be modified in responses, see {{Glossary("forbidden response header name")}}.

Modifying such headers is forbidden because the user agent retains full control over them.
For example, the {{HTTPHeader("Date")}} header is a forbidden request header, so this code cannot set the message `Date` field:

```js example-bad
fetch("https://httpbin.org/get", {
  headers: {
    Date: new Date().toUTCString(),
  },
});
```

Names starting with `Sec-` are reserved for creating new headers safe from {{glossary("API","APIs")}} that grant developers control over headers, such as {{domxref("Window/fetch", "fetch()")}}.
Forbidden headers are one of the following:

- `Accept-Charset`
- {{HTTPHeader("Accept-Encoding")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Request-Headers")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Request-Method")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Connection")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Content-Length")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Cookie")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Date")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("DNT")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Expect")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Host")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Keep-Alive")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Origin")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Permissions-Policy")}}
- `Proxy-` headers
- `Sec-` headers
- {{HTTPHeader("Referer")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("TE")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Trailer")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Transfer-Encoding")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Upgrade")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Via")}}
- `X-HTTP-Method`, but only when it contains a forbidden method name ({{HTTPMethod("CONNECT")}}, {{HTTPMethod("TRACE")}}, {{HTTPMethod("TRACK")}})
- `X-HTTP-Method-Override`, but only when it contains a forbidden method name
- `X-Method-Override`, but only when it contains a forbidden method name

> [!NOTE]
> The {{HTTPHeader("User-Agent")}} header used to be forbidden, but no longer is. However, Chrome still silently drops the header from Fetch requests (see [Chromium bug 571722](https://crbug.com/571722)).

> [!NOTE]
> While the {{HTTPHeader("Referer")}} header is listed as a forbidden header [in the spec](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#forbidden-request-header), the user agent does not retain full control over it and the header can be programmatically modified. For example, when using [`fetch()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/fetch), the {{HTTPHeader("Referer")}} header can be programmatically modified via the [`referrer` option](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RequestInit#referrer).

# Fork

A fork is a copy of an existing software project at some point to add someone's own modifications to the project.

Basically, if the license of the original software allows, you can copy the code to develop your own version of it, with your own additions, which will be a "fork".

Forks are often seen in free and open source software development. This is now a more popular term thanks to contribution model using Git (and/or the GitHub platform).

# Frame rate (FPS)

A **frame rate** is the speed at which the browser is able to recalculate, layout and paint content to the display. The **frames per second**, or **fps**, is how many frames can be repainted in one second. The goal frame rate for in website computer graphics is 60fps.

Movies generally have a frame rate of 24 fps. They are able to have fewer frames per second because the illusion of life is created with motion blurs. When moving on a computer screen there are no motion blurs (unless you are animating an image [sprite](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_images/Implementing_image_sprites_in_CSS) with motion blurs).

# Fragmentainer

A **fragmentainer** is defined in the [CSS Fragmentation](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-break/) specification as follows:

> A box—such as a page box, column box, or region—that contains a portion (or all) of a fragmented flow. Fragmentainers can be pre-defined or generated as needed. When breakable content would overflow a fragmentainer in the block dimension, it breaks into the next container in its fragmentation context instead.

Fragmented contexts are found in [CSS paged media](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_paged_media), where the fragmentainer would be the box that defines a page. In [CSS multiple-column layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_multicol_layout), the fragmentainer is the column box created when columns are defined on a multicol container.

# FTP

**FTP** (File Transfer Protocol) is an insecure {{glossary("protocol")}} for transferring files from one {{glossary("host")}} to another over the Internet.

For many years it was the defacto standard way of transferring files, but as it is inherently insecure, it is no longer supported by many hosting accounts. Instead you should use SFTP (a secure, encrypted version of FTP) or another secure method for transferring files like Rsync over SSH.

# FTU

FTU (First Time Use) is the app that loads when you run a newly-installed version of {{glossary("Gecko")}} on a {{glossary("Firefox OS")}} device.

You can use FTU to set many important options (e.g., timezone, Wi-Fi details, default language, importing contacts), or take the "Phone Tour" to find out more about your device.
# Function

A **function** is a code snippet that can be called by other code or by itself, or a {{Glossary("variable")}} that refers to the function. When a function is called, {{Glossary("Argument", "arguments")}} are passed to the function as input, and the function can optionally return a value. A function in {{glossary("JavaScript")}} is also an {{glossary("object")}}.

A function name is an {{Glossary("identifier")}} included as part of a function declaration or function expression. The function name's {{Glossary("scope")}} depends on whether the function name is a declaration or expression.

### Different types of functions

An **anonymous function** is a function without a function name. Only function expressions can be anonymous, function declarations must have a name:

```js
// Anonymous function created as a function expression
(function () {});

// Anonymous function created as an arrow function
() => {};
```

The following terms are not used in the ECMAScript language specification, they're jargon used to refer to different types of functions.

A **named function** is a function with a function name:

```js
// Function declaration
function foo() {}

// Named function expression
(function bar() {});

// Arrow function
const baz = () => {};
```

An **inner function** is a function inside another function (`square` in this case). An **outer function** is a function containing a function (`addSquares` in this case):

```js
function addSquares(a, b) {
  function square(x) {
    return x * x;
  }
  return square(a) + square(b);
}

// Arrow function
const addSquares2 = (a, b) => {
  const square = (x) => x * x;
  return square(a) + square(b);
};
```

A **recursive function** is a function that calls itself. See {{Glossary("Recursion", "recursion")}}.

```js
function loop(x) {
  if (x >= 10) return;
  loop(x + 1);
}

// Arrow function
const loop2 = (x) => {
  if (x >= 10) return;
  loop2(x + 1);
};
```

An **Immediately Invoked Function Expression** ({{glossary("IIFE")}}) is a function that is called directly after the function is loaded into the browser's compiler. The way to identify an IIFE is by locating the extra left and right parenthesis at the end of the function's definition.

Function expressions, named or anonymous, can be called immediately.

```js
(function foo() {
  console.log("Hello Foo");
})();

(function food() {
  console.log("Hello Food");
})();

(() => console.log("hello world"))();
```

Declared functions can't be called immediately this way, because IIFEs must be function _expressions_.

```js-nolint example-bad
function foo() {
  console.log("Hello Foo");
}();
```

If you'd like to know more about IIFEs, check out the following page on Wikipedia: [Immediately Invoked Function Expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately_invoked_function_expression)

# Fuzz testing

**Fuzzing** is a technique for testing software using automated tools to provide invalid or unexpected input to a program or function in a program, then checking the results to see if the program crashes or otherwise acts inappropriately. This is an important way to ensure that software is stable, reliable, and secure.

- [Wikipedia: Fuzz testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing)
# Gamut

A color **gamut** is a subset of colors, usually representing the colors that a display or a printing device can represent.

No display or printer can represent the whole range of colors that a human eye can perceive. The device _gamut_ represents the set that it supports.

Traditionally, in web development, the only gamut used was _[sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB)_ (Standard Red-Green-Blue), where each color is described using three bytes, one for each primary color. However, "wide-color" monitors and professional printers support a wider range of colors, that can't be represented using this gamut.

Since 2021, browsers have started to provide functionality for other gamuts, like _[Display-P3](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Color_space#display-p3)_, widely used in the movie industry, and _[rec2020](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Color_space#rec2020)_.

Developers can define different sets of colors for devices supporting larger gamuts using the [`color-gamut`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/color-gamut) [media feature](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries). They can describe colors outside the RGB gamut using specific CSS functions like [`lch()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/lch) for the LCH cylindrical coordinate system, or [`lab()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/lab) for the Lab coordinate system.

# Garbage collection

**[Garbage collection](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Memory_management#garbage_collection)** is a term used in {{Glossary("computer programming")}} to describe the process of finding and deleting {{Glossary("object", "objects")}} which are no longer being {{Glossary("object reference", "referenced")}} by other objects.

In other words, garbage collection is the process of removing any objects which are not being used by any other objects. Often abbreviated "GC," garbage collection is a fundamental component of the [memory management](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Memory_management) system used by {{Glossary("JavaScript")}}.

# Gecko

**Gecko** is the layout engine developed by the Mozilla Project and used in many apps/devices, including {{glossary("Mozilla Firefox","Firefox")}} and {{glossary("Firefox OS")}}.

Web {{glossary("browser","browsers")}} need software called a layout engine to interpret {{glossary("HTML")}}, {{glossary("CSS")}}, {{glossary("JavaScript")}}, and embedded content (like images) and draw everything to your screen. Besides this, Gecko makes sure associated {{glossary("API","APIs")}} work well on every operating system Gecko supports, and that appropriate APIs are exposed only to relevant support targets. This means that Gecko includes, among other things, a networking stack, graphics stack, layout engine, a JavaScript virtual machine, and porting layers.

Since all Firefox OS apps are Web apps, Firefox OS uses Gecko as its app runtime as well.

# General header

**General header** is an outdated term used to refer to an {{glossary('HTTP_header', 'HTTP header')}} that can be used in both request and response messages, but which doesn't apply to the content itself (a header that applied to the content was called an {{glossary("entity header")}}). Depending on the context they are used in, general headers might either be {{glossary("Response header", "response")}} or {{glossary("request header", "request headers")}} (e.g., {{HTTPheader("Cache-Control")}}).

> [!NOTE]
> Current versions of the HTTP/1.1 specification do not specifically categorize headers as "general headers". These are now simply referred to as {{glossary("Response header", "response")}} or {{glossary("request header", "request headers")}} depending on context.

# Git

**Git** is a free, open-source, distributed Source Code Management ({{Glossary("SCM")}}) system. It facilitates handling code bases with distributed development teams. What sets it apart from previous SCM systems is the ability to do common operations (branching, committing, etc.) on your local development machine, without having to change the master repository or even having write access to it.

# Global object

The **global object** in JavaScript is an {{glossary("object")}} which represents the {{glossary("global scope")}}.

> [!NOTE]
> _Globally available objects_, which are objects in the {{glossary("global scope")}}, are sometimes also referred to as global objects, but strictly speaking, there is only one global object per environment.

In each JavaScript environment, there's always a global object defined. The global object's interface depends on the execution context in which the script is running. For example:

- In a web browser, any code which the script doesn't specifically start up as a background task has a {{domxref("Window")}} as its global object. This is the vast majority of JavaScript code on the Web.
- Code running in a {{domxref("Worker")}} has a {{domxref("WorkerGlobalScope")}} object as its global object.
- Scripts running under {{Glossary("Node.js")}} have an object called [`global`](https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#globals_global) as their global object.

The [`globalThis`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/globalThis) global property allows one to access the global object regardless of the current environment.

[`var`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var) statements and [function declarations](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function) at the top level of a script create properties of the global object. On the other hand, {{jsxref("Statements/let", "let")}} and {{jsxref("Statements/const", "const")}} declarations never create properties of the global object.

The properties of the global object are automatically added to the {{glossary("global scope")}}.

In JavaScript, the global object always holds a reference to itself:

```js
console.log(globalThis === globalThis.globalThis); // true (everywhere)
console.log(window === window.window); // true (in a browser)
console.log(self === self.self); // true (in a browser or a Web Worker)
console.log(frames === frames.frames); // true (in a browser)
console.log(global === global.global); // true (in Node.js)
```

# Global scope

In a programming environment, the _global scope_ is the {{glossary("scope")}} that contains, and is visible in, all other scopes.

In client-side JavaScript, the global scope is generally the web page inside which all the code is being executed.

# Google Chrome

**Chrome** is a free {{Glossary("Browser","web browser")}} developed by Google, based on the [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/) open source project. Some key differences are described in BrowserStack's [Chrome vs Chromium: Core Differences](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/difference-between-chrome-and-chromium) guide.

Chrome, like Chromium, uses a rendering engine called {{Glossary("Blink")}}. On iOS though, due to platform restrictions, Chrome uses Apple's WebKit-based WebView instead of Blink.

## Download Chrome

Chrome is available on multiple platforms and comes in different versions for different user needs.

### Users

If you're an everyday Chrome user, use one of these links based on your platform or device:

# Graceful degradation

**Graceful degradation** is a design philosophy that centers around trying to build a modern website/application that will work in the newest browsers, but falls back to an experience that while not as good still delivers essential content and functionality in older browsers.

{{Glossary("Polyfill","Polyfills")}} can be used to build in missing features with JavaScript, but acceptable alternatives to features like styling and layout should be provided where possible, for example by using the CSS cascade, or HTML fallback behavior.

It is a useful technique that allows Web developers to focus on developing the best possible websites, given that those websites are accessed by multiple unknown user-agents. {{Glossary("Progressive enhancement")}} is related but different — often seen as going in the opposite direction to graceful degradation. In reality both approaches are valid and can often complement one another.

# Grid areas

A **grid area** is one or more {{glossary("grid cell", "grid cells")}} that make up a rectangular area on the grid. Grid areas are created when you place an item using [line-based placement](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Grid_layout_using_line-based_placement) or when defining areas using [named grid areas](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Grid_template_areas).

![Image showing a highlighted grid area](1_grid_area.png)

Grid areas _must_ be rectangular in nature; it is not possible to create, for example, a T- or L-shaped grid area.

## Example

In the example below I have a grid container with two grid items. I have named these with the {{cssxref("grid-area")}} property and then laid them out on the grid using {{cssxref("grid-template-areas")}}. This creates two grid areas, one covering four grid cells, the other two.

```css hidden
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

.wrapper {
  border: 2px solid #f76707;
  border-radius: 5px;
  background-color: #fff4e6;
}

.wrapper > div {
  border: 2px solid #ffa94d;
  border-radius: 5px;
  background-color: #ffd8a8;
  padding: 1em;
  color: #d9480f;
}
```

```css
.wrapper {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: 100px 100px;
  grid-template-areas:
    "a a b"
    "a a b";
}
.item1 {
  grid-area: a;
}
.item2 {
  grid-area: b;
}
```

```html
<div class="wrapper">

# Grid Axis

CSS grid layout is a two-dimensional layout method enabling the laying out of content in _rows_ and _columns_. Therefore in any grid we have two axes. The _block or column axis_, and the _inline or row axis_.

It is along these axes that items can be aligned and justified using the properties defined in the [Box Alignment specification](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_box_alignment).

The _inline axis_ (also called row axis, or main axis) is the direction along which regular text flows. The _block axis_ (also called column axis, or cross axis) is the axis used when laying out blocks of text. The physical direction of these axes can change according to the [writing mode](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Grids_logical_values_and_writing_modes) of the document.

For example, if you are writing left to right, top to bottom (like typical English prose), then the individual characters are placed along the inline axis, which runs from left to right.

![Diagram showing the inline axis in CSS grid layout.](7_inline_axis.png)

And, if the text contains multiple lines, these lines are placed along the block axis, which runs from top to bottom.

![Diagram showing the block axis in CSS grid layout.](7_block_axis.png)

# Grid Cell

In a [CSS grid layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout), a **grid cell** is the smallest unit you can have on your CSS grid. It is the space between four intersecting {{glossary("grid lines")}} and conceptually much like a table cell.

![Diagram showing an individual cell on the grid.](1_grid_cell.png)

If you do not place items using one of the grid placement methods, direct children of the grid container will be placed one into each individual grid cell by the auto-placement algorithm. Additional row or column {{glossary("grid tracks", "tracks")}} will be created to create enough cells to hold all items.

## Example

In the example we have created a three column track grid. The five items are placed into grid cells working along an initial row of three grid cells, then creating a new row for the remaining two.

```css hidden
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

.wrapper {
  border: 2px solid #f76707;
  border-radius: 5px;
  background-color: #fff4e6;
}

.wrapper > div {
  border: 2px solid #ffa94d;
  border-radius: 5px;
  background-color: #ffd8a8;
  padding: 1em;
  color: #d9480f;
}
```

```css
.wrapper {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-auto-rows: 100px;
}
```

```html
<div class="wrapper">
  <div>One</div>
  <div>Two</div>
  <div>Three</div>
  <div>Four</div>

# Grid Column

A **grid column** is a vertical track in a [CSS grid layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout), and is the space between two vertical grid lines. It is defined by the {{cssxref("grid-template-columns")}} property or in the shorthand {{cssxref("grid")}} or {{cssxref("grid-template")}} properties.

In addition, columns may be created in the _implicit grid_ when items are placed outside of columns created in the _explicit grid_. These columns will be auto-sized by default, or can have a size specified with the {{cssxref("grid-auto-columns")}} property.

When working with alignment in [CSS grid layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout), the axis down which columns run is known as the _block, or column, axis_.

# Grid container

Using the value `grid` or `inline-grid` on an element turns it into a **grid container** using [CSS grid layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout), and any direct children of this element become grid items.

When an element becomes a grid container it establishes a **grid formatting context**. The direct children can now lay themselves out on any explicit grid defined using {{cssxref("grid-template-columns")}} and {{cssxref("grid-template-rows")}}, or on the _implicit grid_ created when an item is placed outside of the _explicit grid_.

# Grid

A _CSS grid_ is defined using the `grid` value of the {{cssxref("display")}} property; you can define columns and rows on your grid using the {{cssxref("grid-template-rows")}} and {{cssxref("grid-template-columns")}} properties.

The grid that you define using these properties is described as an _explicit grid_.

If you place content outside of this explicit grid, or if you are relying on auto-placement and the grid algorithm needs to create additional row or column {{glossary("grid tracks", "tracks")}} to hold {{glossary("grid cell", "grid cells")}}, then extra tracks will be created in the implicit grid. The _implicit grid_ is the grid created automatically due to content being added outside of the tracks defined.

In the example below I have created an _explicit grid_ of three columns and two rows. The _third_ row on the grid is an _implicit grid_ row track, formed due to their being more than the six items which fill the explicit tracks.

## Example

```css hidden
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

.wrapper {
  border: 2px solid #f76707;
  border-radius: 5px;
  background-color: #fff4e6;
}

.wrapper > div {
  border: 2px solid #ffa94d;
  border-radius: 5px;
  background-color: #ffd8a8;
  padding: 1em;
  color: #d9480f;
}
```

```css
.wrapper {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 100px 100px;
}
```

```html
<div class="wrapper">
  <div>One</div>
  <div>Two</div>
  <div>Three</div>
  <div>Four</div>
  <div>Five</div>
  <div>Six</div>
  <div>Seven</div>
  <div>Eight</div>
</div>

**Grid lines** are created anytime you use a [CSS grid layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout).

## Example

In the following example there is a grid with three column tracks and two row tracks. This gives us 4 column lines and 3 row lines.

```css hidden
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

.wrapper {
  border: 2px solid #f76707;
  border-radius: 5px;
  background-color: #fff4e6;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 100px);
}

.wrapper > div {
  border: 2px solid #ffa94d;
  border-radius: 5px;
  background-color: #ffd8a8;
  padding: 1em;
  color: #d9480f;
}
```

```html
<div class="wrapper">
  <div>One</div>
  <div>Two</div>
  <div>Three</div>
  <div>Four</div>
  <div>Five</div>
</div>
```

```css
.wrapper {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: 100px 100px;
}
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Example', '500', '250') }}

Lines can be addressed using their line number. In a left-to-right language such as English, column line 1 will be on the left of the grid, row line 1 on the top. Lines numbers respect the [writing mode](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_writing_modes) of the document and so in a right-to-left language for example, column line 1 will be on the right of the grid. The image below shows the line numbers of the grid, assuming the language is left-to-right.

![Diagram showing the grid with lines numbered.](1_diagram_numbered_grid_lines.png)

Lines are also created in the _implicit grid_ when implicit tracks are created to hold content positioned outside of the _explicit grid_, however these lines cannot be addressed by a number.

## Placing items onto the grid by line number

Having created a grid, you can place items onto the grid by line number. In the following example the item is positioned from column line 1 to column line 3, and from row line 1 to row line 3.

```css hidden
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

.wrapper {
  border: 2px solid #f76707;
  border-radius: 5px;
  background-color: #fff4e6;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 100px);
}

.wrapper > div {
  border: 2px solid #ffa94d;
  border-radius: 5px;
  background-color: #ffd8a8;
  padding: 1em;
  color: #d9480f;
}
```

```html
<div class="wrapper">
  <div class="item">Item</div>
</div>
```

```css
.wrapper {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: 100px 100px;
}
.item {
  grid-column-start: 1;
  grid-column-end: 3;
  grid-row-start: 1;
  grid-row-end: 3;
}
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Placing_items_onto_the_grid_by_line_number', '500', '250') }}

## Naming lines

The lines created in the _explicit grid_ can be named, by adding the name in square brackets before or after the track sizing information. When placing an item, you can then use these names instead of the line number, as demonstrated below.

```css hidden
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

.wrapper {
  border: 2px solid #f76707;
  border-radius: 5px;
  background-color: #fff4e6;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 100px);
}

.wrapper > div {
  border: 2px solid #ffa94d;
  border-radius: 5px;
  background-color: #ffd8a8;
  padding: 1em;
  color: #d9480f;
}
```

```html
<div class="wrapper">
  <div class="item">Item</div>
</div>
```

```css
.wrapper {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: [col1-start] 1fr [col2-start] 1fr [col3-start] 1fr [cols-end];
  grid-template-rows: [row1-start] 100px [row2-start] 100px [rows-end];
}
.item {
  grid-column-start: col1-start;
  grid-column-end: col3-start;
  grid-row-start: row1-start;
  grid-row-end: rows-end;
}
```

# Grid Row

A **grid row** is a horizontal track in a [CSS grid layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout), that is the space between two horizontal grid lines. It is defined by the {{cssxref("grid-template-rows")}} property or in the shorthand {{cssxref("grid")}} or {{cssxref("grid-template")}} properties.

In addition, rows may be created in the _implicit grid_ when items are placed outside of rows created in the _explicit grid_. These rows will be auto sized by default, or can have a size specified with the {{cssxref("grid-auto-rows")}} property.

When working with alignment in [CSS grid layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout), the axis along which rows run is known as the _inline, or row, axis_.

# Grid Tracks

A **grid track** is the space between two adjacent {{glossary("grid lines")}}. They are defined in the _explicit grid_ by using the {{cssxref("grid-template-columns")}} and {{cssxref("grid-template-rows")}} properties or the shorthand {{cssxref("grid")}} or {{cssxref("grid-template")}} properties. Tracks are also created in the _implicit grid_ by positioning a grid item outside of the tracks created in the explicit grid.

The image below shows the first row track on a grid.

![Diagram showing a grid track.](1_grid_track.png)

## Track sizing in the explicit grid

When defining grid tracks using {{cssxref("grid-template-columns")}} and {{cssxref("grid-template-rows")}} you may use any length unit, and also the flex unit, `fr` which indicates a portion of the available space in the grid container.

## Example

The example below demonstrates a grid with three column tracks, one of 200 pixels, the second of 1fr, the third of 3fr. Once the 200 pixels has been subtracted from the space available in the grid container, the remaining space is divided by 4. One part is given to column 2, 3 parts to column 3.

```css hidden
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

.wrapper {
  border: 2px solid #f76707;
  border-radius: 5px;
  background-color: #fff4e6;
}

.wrapper > div {
  border: 2px solid #ffa94d;
  border-radius: 5px;
  background-color: #ffd8a8;
  padding: 1em;
  color: #d9480f;
}
```

```css
.wrapper {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr 3fr;
}
```

```html
<div class="wrapper">
  <div>One</div>
  <div>Two</div>
  <div>Three</div>
  <div>Four</div>
  <div>Five</div>
</div>
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Example', '500', '230') }}

## Track sizing in the implicit grid

Tracks created in the implicit grid are auto-sized by default, however you can define a size for these tracks using the {{cssxref("grid-auto-rows")}} and {{cssxref("grid-auto-columns")}} properties.

# Guaranteed-invalid value

In CSS the guaranteed-invalid value is {{CSSXref("initial")}}.

When a [custom property](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*)'s value is the guaranteed-invalid value, the {{CSSXref("var")}} function cannot use it for substitution. Attempting to do so makes the declaration _invalid at computed-value time_, unless a valid fallback is specified.

# Gutters

**Gutters** or _alleys_ are spacing between content {{glossary("grid_tracks", "tracks")}}. These can be created in [CSS grid layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout) using the {{cssxref("column-gap")}}, {{cssxref("row-gap")}}, or {{cssxref("gap")}} properties.

## Example

In the example below we have a three-column and two-row track grid, with `20px` gaps between both column tracks and row tracks.

```css hidden
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

.wrapper {
  border: 2px solid #f76707;
  border-radius: 5px;
  background-color: #fff4e6;
}

.wrapper > div {
  border: 2px solid #ffa94d;
  border-radius: 5px;
  background-color: #fff8f8;
  padding: 1em;
  color: #d9480f;
}
```

```css
.wrapper {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1.2fr);
  grid-auto-rows: 45%;
  column-gap: 20px;
  row-gap: 20px;
}
```

```html
<div class="wrapper">
  <div>One</div>
  <div>Two</div>
  <div>Three</div>
  <div>Four</div>
  <div>Five</div>
</div>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Example', '300', '280')}}

In terms of grid sizing, gaps act as if they were a regular grid track however nothing can be placed into the gap. The gap acts as if the grid line at that location has gained extra size, so any grid item placed after that line begins at the end of the gap.

The `row-gap` and `column-gap` properties are not the only things that can cause tracks to space out. Margins, padding, or the use of the space distribution properties in [CSS box alignment](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_box_alignment) can all contribute to the visible gap – therefore the `row-gap` and `column-gap` properties should not be seen as equal to the "gutter size" unless you know that your design has not introduced any additional space with one of these methods.

# gzip compression

**gzip** is a file format used in file compression and decompression. It is based on [the Deflate algorithm](https://www.zlib.net/feldspar.html) which allows files to be made smaller, allowing for faster network transfers. gzip is commonly supported by web servers and modern browsers, meaning that servers can automatically compress files with gzip before sending them, and browsers can uncompress files upon receiving them.

# Hash function

A **hash function** is a function that takes a variable-length input and produces a fixed-length output, also called a _digest_ (or just a "hash"). Hash functions should be quick to compute, and different inputs should as far as possible produce different outputs (this is called _collision-resistance_).

Hash functions have both {{glossary("cryptography", "cryptographic")}} and non-cryptographic uses. Outside cryptography, for example, hash functions can be used to generate the keys for an associative array such as a map or a dictionary.

The {{domxref("SubtleCrypto.digest()", "digest()")}} function of the {{domxref("SubtleCrypto")}} interface makes various hash functions available to web applications.

## Cryptographic hash functions

In cryptography, hash functions have many applications, including {{Glossary("digital signature", "digital signatures")}}, and {{Glossary("HMAC", "message authentication codes")}}.

Not all hash functions are appropriate for cryptography. To be used for cryptography, a hash function must be:

- quick to compute
- one-way: given the output, it should be impractical or impossible to regenerate the original input
- tamper-resistant: any change to the input leads to a different output
- collision-resistant: it should be impractical to find two different inputs that produce the same output

The hash functions most commonly used in cryptography are from the _SHA-2_ (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) family, whose names are `"SHA-"` followed by the length of the output digest in bits: for example, `"SHA-256"` and `"SHA-512"`.

SHA-2 is the successor to the SHA-1 algorithm, which is no longer considered secure and should not be used in cryptography. Note that the MD5 algorithm is also considered insecure.

# Hash routing

**Hash routing** is a client-side technique used in single-page applications (SPAs) to manage navigation and state changes without reloading the entire page.

## Historical context

Early SPAs could not change the [path](/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Path) part of the URL without reloading the page. To work around this, developers used **hash-based SPA routing**, which stores the route in the "[fragment](/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Fragment)", the part of the URL that follows the symbol `#`. Common patterns included `#/profile` and `#!/profile`. Applications continually checked [`window.location.hash`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location/hash) (or listened for the [`hashchange`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/hashchange_event) event when it was supported later) to detect fragment changes during user navigation; the SPA then updated the view whenever the fragment changed.

## Limitations

Though this approach needed no server setup, it had limitations: {{glossary("bfcache", "back/forward")}} support was limited, pages with hash-based URLs were not indexed properly (search engines ignored the fragment), and the resulting URLs were considered messy.

Hash-based routing is now considered a legacy technique. It is used, if at all, only as a fallback for very old browsers or for static hosts where server-side routing cannot be configured.

## Modern alternatives

By 2012, all major browsers (Chrome 5, Safari 5, Firefox 4) supported the [History API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API). SPAs could now call [`pushState()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState), [`replaceState()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/replaceState), and the [`popstate`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/PopStateEvent) event to manipulate the browser's history stack, switch to paths such as `/profile` directly, and update the view without a full reload. This also allowed for cleaner URLs without hash fragments.
# Head

The **Head** is the part of an {{glossary("HTML")}} document that contains {{glossary("metadata")}} about that document, such as author, description, and links to {{glossary("CSS")}} or {{glossary("JavaScript")}} files that should be applied to the HTML.

# Head-of-line blocking

In computer networking, **head-of-line blocking** (_HOL blocking_) refers to a performance bottleneck that occurs when a queue of packets is held up by the first packet in the queue, even though other packets in the queue could be processed.

In HTTP/1.1, HOL blocking occurs when a client sends multiple requests to a {{glossary("server")}} over a particular TCP connection, and a response on that connection is delayed for any reason — such as network congestion, {{glossary("TCP slow start")}}, or, problems in transit.
HTTP/1.1 requests are sent sequentially per TCP connection, so a delay in receiving a response blocks the next request-response exchange.

A mechanism called _HTTP pipelining_ tried to work around this, where multiple requests were sent off by a client without waiting for any responses.
Pipelining proved tricky to implement in reality, so this mechanism is rarely used, if ever, and most browsers no longer support it.

HTTP/2 addresses the HOL blocking problems in HTTP/1.1 through request _multiplexing_.
Multiplexing allows a single TCP connection to interleave requests and responses in numbered streams.
A client can send many requests over a single connection without waiting for earlier responses.
Note that while HOL blocking has been fixed in HTTP/2, it is still a problem at the transport ({{glossary("TCP")}}) layer level.

# High-level programming language

A high-level programming language has a **significant abstraction** from the details of computer operation. It is designed to be easily understood by humans and for this reason they must be translated by another software. Unlike low-level programming languages, it may use natural language elements, or may automate (or even entirely hide) significant areas of computing systems, making the process of developing simpler and more understandable relative to a lower-level language. The amount of abstraction provided defines how "high-level" a programming language is.

The idea of a language automatically translatable into machine code, but nearer to human logic, was introduced in computer science in the 1950s, especially thanks to the work of **John Backus** (IBM), to whom it owes the first high-level language to have been widely circulated: Fortran. For this innovation Backus received the Turing prize.
# HMAC

**Hash-based message authentication code**(_HMAC_) is a mechanism used for {{Glossary("cryptography", "cryptographically")}} authenticating messages.

It can use any kind of {{Glossary("Hash function", "cryptographic hash function")}}. Its strength depends on the underlying hash function and the chosen secret key. With such a combination, the HMAC verification {{Glossary("Algorithm", "algorithm")}} is then known with a compound name such as HMAC-SHA2.

HMAC is used to ensure both integrity and authentication.

# Hoisting

JavaScript **Hoisting** refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the _declaration_ of functions, variables, classes, or imports to the top of their {{glossary("scope")}}, prior to execution of the code.

_Hoisting_ is not a term normatively defined in the ECMAScript specification. The spec does define a group of declarations as [_HoistableDeclaration_](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/ecmascript-language-statements-and-declarations.html#prod-HoistableDeclaration), but this only includes [`function`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function), [`function*`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*), [`async function`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function), and [`async function*`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function*) declarations. Hoisting is often considered a feature of [`var`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var) declarations as well, although in a different way. In colloquial terms, any of the following behaviors may be regarded as hoisting:

1. Being able to use a variable's value in its scope before the line it is declared. ("Value hoisting")
2. Being able to reference a variable in its scope before the line it is declared, without throwing a {{jsxref("ReferenceError")}}, but the value is always [`undefined`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined). ("Declaration hoisting")
3. The declaration of the variable causes behavior changes in its scope before the line in which it is declared.
4. The side effects of a declaration are produced before evaluating the rest of the code that contains it.

The four function declarations above are hoisted with type 1 behavior; `var` declaration is hoisted with type 2 behavior; [`let`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let), [`const`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const), and [`class`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/class) declarations (also collectively called _lexical declarations_) are hoisted with type 3 behavior; [`import`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) declarations are hoisted with type 1 and type 4 behavior.

Some prefer to see `let`, `const`, and `class` as non-hoisting, because the [temporal dead zone](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let#temporal_dead_zone_tdz) strictly forbids any use of the variable before its declaration. This dissent is fine, since hoisting is not a universally-agreed term. However, the temporal dead zone can cause other observable changes in its scope, which suggests there's some form of hoisting:

```js
const x = 1;
{
  console.log(x); // ReferenceError
  const x = 2;
}
```

If the `const x = 2` declaration is not hoisted at all (as in, it only comes into effect when it's executed), then the `console.log(x)` statement should be able to read the `x` value from the upper scope. However, because the `const` declaration still "taints" the entire scope it's defined in, the `console.log(x)` statement reads the `x` from the `const x = 2` declaration instead, which is not yet initialized, and throws a {{jsxref("ReferenceError")}}. Still, it may be more useful to characterize lexical declarations as non-hoisting, because from a utilitarian perspective, the hoisting of these declarations doesn't bring any meaningful features.

Note that the following is not a form of hoisting:

```js
{
  var x = 1;
}
console.log(x); // 1
```

There's no "access before declaration" here; it's simply because `var` declarations are not scoped to blocks.

# Host

A host is a device connected to the {{glossary("Internet")}} (or a local network). Some hosts called {{glossary("server","servers")}} offer additional services like serving webpages or storing files and emails.

The host doesn't need to be a hardware instance. It can be generated by virtual machines. The host generated by virtual machines is called "Virtual hosting".

# Hotlink

A **hotlink** (also known as an **inline link**) is an object (typically an image) directly linked to from another site. For example, an image hosted on site1.com is shown directly on site2.com.

The practice is frowned upon, as it can cause unwanted bandwidth usage on the website hosting the linked-to object. From an ethical standpoint, it could be considered stealing when done without permission.

# Houdini

Houdini is a set of low level APIs that give developers the power to extend CSS, providing the ability to hook into the styling and layout process of a browser's rendering engine. Houdini gives developers access to the [CSS Object Model](/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS_Object_Model) ({{Glossary("CSSOM")}}), enabling developers to write code the browser can parse as CSS.

The benefit of Houdini is that developers can create CSS features without waiting for web standards specifications to define them and without waiting for every browser to fully implement the features.

While many of the features Houdini enables can be created with JavaScript, interacting directly with the CSSOM before JavaScript is enabled provides for faster parse times. Browsers create the CSSOM — including layout, paint, and composite processes — before applying any style updates found in scripts: layout, paint, and composite processes are repeated for updated JavaScript styles to be implemented. Houdini code doesn't wait for that first rendering cycle to be complete. Rather, it is included in that first cycle, creating renderable, understandable styles.

# HPKP

**HTTP Public Key Pinning** (**HPKP**) is an obsolete security feature that tells a web client to associate a specific cryptographic public key with a certain web server to decrease the risk of {{Glossary("MITM")}} attacks with forged certificates.

# HSTS

**HTTP Strict Transport Security** lets a website inform the browser that it should never load the site using HTTP and should automatically convert all attempts to access the site using HTTP to HTTPS requests instead. It consists in one HTTP header, {{HTTPHeader("Strict-Transport-Security")}}, sent by the server with the resource.

In other words, it tells the browser that changing the protocol from HTTP to HTTPS in a URL works (and is more secure) and asks the browser to do it for every request.

# HTML5

The term HTML5 is essentially a buzzword that refers to a set of modern web technologies. This includes the {{Glossary("HTML")}} Living Standard, along with {{glossary("JavaScript")}} {{glossary("API","APIs")}} to enhance storage, multimedia, and hardware access.

You may sometimes hear about "new HTML5 elements", or find HTML5 described as a new version of HTML. HTML5 was the successor to previous HTML versions and introduced new elements and capabilities to the language on top of the previous version, HTML 4.01, as well as improving or removing some existing functionality. However, as a Living Standard HTML now has no version. The up-to-date specification can be found at [html.spec.whatwg.org/](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/).

Any modern site should use the [HTML doctype](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Code_style_guide/HTML#doctype) — this will ensure that you are using the latest version of HTML.

> [!NOTE]
> Until 2019, the {{glossary("W3C")}} published a competing HTML5 standard with version numbers. Since [28 May 2019](https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/7753), the WHATWG Living Standard was announced by the W3C as the sole version of HTML.

# HTML color codes

**HTML color codes** is a _defacto_ general term used to describe the earliest-available methods for specifying colors on web pages. This includes HTML color names such as `black`, `purple`, and `aqua`, and hexadecimal notations such as `#000000`, `#800080`, and `#00ffff`. These were originally defined in HTML specifications — see for example the [HTML 3.2 color definitions](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/SPSD-html32-20180315/#colors) of the original 16 HTML colors.

It is no longer accurate to refer to colors on the web as "HTML color codes" or "HTML color names". Colors are now specified in the [CSS color module](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_colors), and generally known as CSS colors or web colors.

# HTML

**HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) is a descriptive language that specifies webpage structure.

## Brief history

In 1990, as part of his vision of the {{Glossary("World Wide Web","Web")}}, Tim Berners-Lee defined the concept of {{Glossary("hypertext")}}, which Berners-Lee formalized the following year through a markup mainly based on {{Glossary("SGML")}}. The {{Glossary("IETF")}} began formally specifying HTML in 1993, and after several drafts released version 2.0 in 1995. In 1994 Berners-Lee founded the {{Glossary("W3C")}} to develop the Web. In 1996, the W3C took over the HTML work and published the HTML 3.2 recommendation a year later. HTML 4.0 was released in 1999 and became an {{Glossary("ISO")}} standard in 2000.

At that time, the W3C nearly abandoned HTML in favor of {{Glossary("XHTML")}}, prompting the founding of an independent group called {{Glossary("WHATWG")}} in 2004. Thanks to WHATWG, work on HTML continued: the two organizations released the first draft of {{Glossary("HTML5")}} in 2008 and an official standard in 2014. The term "HTML5" is just a buzzword referring to modern web technologies which are part of the [HTML Living Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/).

## Concept and syntax

An HTML document is a plaintext document structured with {{Glossary("element","elements")}}. Elements are surrounded by matching opening and closing {{Glossary("tag","tags")}}. Each tag begins and ends with angle brackets (`<>`). There are a few empty or _void_ elements that cannot enclose any text, for instance {{htmlelement("img")}}.

You can extend HTML tags with {{Glossary("attribute","attributes")}}, which provide additional information affecting how the browser interprets the element:

![Detail of the structure of an HTML element](anatomy-of-an-html-element.png)

An HTML file is normally saved with an `.htm` or `.html` extension, served by a {{Glossary("Server","web server")}}, and can be rendered by any {{Glossary("Browser","Web browser")}}.

# HTTP/2

**HTTP/2** is a major revision of the [HTTP network protocol](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP).

The primary goals for HTTP/2 are to reduce {{glossary("latency")}} and {{glossary("head of line blocking", "head-of-line blocking")}} by enabling full request and response multiplexing, minimize protocol overhead via efficient compression of HTTP header fields (HPACK), and support for request prioritization.

HTTP/2 also introduced a mechanism called Server Push, which allowed a server to send resources to a client in anticipation that the client would need them very soon.
Server Push proved tricky to implement in practice, and has been removed from most major browser engines.
It has been replaced by alternative methods such as [`rel="preload"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel/preload) and {{HTTPStatus("103", "103 Early hints")}}.

HTTP/2 does not modify the semantics of HTTP, meaning the core concepts found in HTTP/1.1, such as methods, status codes, URIs, and header fields, remain the same.
Instead, HTTP/2 modifies how the data is formatted (framed) and transported between the client and server, both of which manage the entire process, and hides protocol complexity within a framing layer.
As a result, all existing applications can be delivered over the protocol without modification.

# HTTP/3

**HTTP/3** is a major revision of the [HTTP network protocol](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP), succeeding {{glossary("HTTP 2", "HTTP/2")}}.

The most notable difference in HTTP/3 is that it uses a protocol named QUIC over {{glossary("UDP")}} instead of {{glossary("TCP")}}.

# HTTP content

In HTTP messages, the **content** describes the 'information' conveyed in the message body (which follows the header section), after any message framing from HTTP/1.1 chunked transfer encoding has been removed.
This was referred to as a "payload" in HTTP/1.1, but message "content" distinguishes from frame payloads in HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 where the data in a single frame could be header data, body data, or other control information.

The purpose of message content in HTTP requests and responses depends on the request method and response status code.
For example, in a {{HTTPMethod("PUT")}} request, the content represents the desired state of the resource, but in a {{HTTPMethod("POST")}} request, it is information to be processed.
A {{HTTPStatus("200", "200 OK")}} response to a {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} request shows the current state of the resource, while an error response describes the error.

Some responses, like those to {{HTTPMethod("HEAD")}} requests or {{HTTPStatus("204", "204 No Content")}} and {{HTTPStatus("204", "304 Not Modified")}} status codes, do not include content at all.

In the following HTTP/1.1 response, the message body contains the content `Mozilla Developer Network`:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain

Mozilla Developer Network
```

In the next HTTP/1.1 response, transfer encoding encodes the data into chunks.
The content is still `Mozilla Developer Network` in the end, but the message body includes different message data to separate the chunks:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

7\r\n
Mozilla\r\n
9\r\n
Developer\r\n
7\r\n
Network\r\n
0\r\n
\r\n
```

# HTTP header

An **HTTP header** is a field of an HTTP request or response that passes additional context and metadata about the request or response. For example, a request message can use headers to indicate its preferred media formats, while a response can use header to indicate the media format of the returned body. Headers are case-insensitive, begin at the start of a line and are immediately followed by a `':'` and a header-dependent value. The value finishes at the next CRLF or at the end of the message.

The HTTP and Fetch specifications refer to a number of header categories, including:

- {{Glossary("Request header")}}: Headers containing more information about the resource to be fetched or about the client itself.
- {{Glossary("Response header")}}: Headers with additional information about the response, like its location or about the server itself (name, version, …).
- {{Glossary("Representation header")}}: metadata about the resource in the message body (e.g., encoding, media type, etc.).
- {{Glossary("Fetch metadata request header")}}: Headers with metadata about the resource in the message body (e.g., encoding, media type, etc.).

A basic request with one header:

```http
GET /example.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

Redirects have mandatory headers ({{HTTPHeader("Location")}}):

```http
302 Found
Location: /NewPage.html
```

A typical set of headers:

```http
304 Not Modified
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Age: 2318192
Cache-Control: public, max-age=315360000
Connection: keep-alive

Server: Apache

X-Cache: Hit from cloudfront

```

> [!NOTE]
> Older versions of the specification referred to:
>
> - {{Glossary("General header")}}: Headers applying to both requests and responses but with no relation to the data eventually transmitted in the body.
> - {{Glossary("Entity header")}}: Headers containing more information about the body of the entity, like its content length or its MIME-type (this is a superset of what are now referred to as the Representation metadata headers)

# HTTP

The HyperText Transfer Protocol (**HTTP**) is the underlying network {{glossary("protocol")}} that enables transfer of hypermedia documents on the {{glossary("World Wide Web","Web")}}, typically between a browser and a server so that humans can read them. The current version of the HTTP specification is called {{glossary("HTTP_2", "HTTP/2")}}.

As part of a {{glossary("URI")}}, the "http" within "http\://example.com/" is called a "scheme". Resources using the "http" scheme are typically transported over unencrypted connections using the HTTP protocol. The "https" scheme (as in "https\://developer.mozilla.org") indicates that a resource is transported using the HTTP protocol, but over a secure {{glossary("TLS")}} channel.

HTTP is textual (all communication is done in plain text) and stateless (no communication is aware of previous communications). This property makes it ideal for humans to read documents (websites) on the world wide web. However, HTTP can also be used as a basis for {{glossary("REST")}} web services from server to server or {{domxref("Window/fetch", "fetch()")}} requests within websites to make them more dynamic.

# HTTPS

**HTTPS** (**_HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure_**) is an encrypted version of the {{Glossary("HTTP")}} protocol. It uses {{Glossary("TLS")}} to encrypt all communication between a client and a server. This secure connection allows clients to safely exchange sensitive data with a server, such as when performing banking activities or online shopping.

# HTTPS RR

**HTTPS RR** (**_HTTPS Resource Records_**) are a type of DNS record that delivers configuration information and parameters for how to access a service via {{Glossary("HTTPS")}}.

An _HTTPS RR_ can be used to optimize the process of connecting to a service using HTTPS.
Further, the presence of an _HTTPS RR_ signals that all useful {{Glossary("HTTP")}} resources on the origin are reachable over HTTPS, which in turn means that a browser can safely upgrade connections to the domain from HTTP to HTTPS.

# Hyperlink

Hyperlinks connect webpages or data items to one another. In HTML, {{HTMLElement("a")}} elements define hyperlinks from a spot on a webpage (like a text string or image) to another spot on some other webpage (or even on the same page).

# IANA

**IANA** (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) is a subsidiary of {{glossary("ICANN")}} charged with recording and/or assigning {{glossary("domain name","domain names")}}, {{glossary("IP address","IP addresses")}}, and other names and numbers used by Internet {{glossary("protocol","protocols")}}.

# ICE

**ICE** (_Interactive Connectivity Establishment_) is a framework used by {{glossary("WebRTC")}} (among other technologies) for connecting two peers, regardless of network topology (usually for audio and video chat). This protocol lets two peers find and establish a connection with one another even though they may both be using Network Address Translator ({{glossary("NAT")}}) to share a global IP address with other devices on their respective local networks.

The framework algorithm looks for the lowest-latency path for connecting the two peers, trying these options in order:

1. Direct UDP connection (In this case—and only this case—a {{glossary("STUN")}} server is used to find the network-facing address of a peer)
2. Direct TCP connection, via the HTTP port
3. Direct TCP connection, via the HTTPS port
4. Indirect connection via a relay/{{glossary("TURN")}} server (if a direct connection fails, e.g., if one peer is behind a firewall that blocks NAT traversal)

# IDE

An Integrated Development Environment (**IDE**) or Interactive Development environment is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger.

# Idempotent

An HTTP method is **idempotent** if the intended effect on the server of making a single request is the same as the effect of making several identical requests.

The HTTP specification defines several HTTP methods and their semantics, which includes whether they are idempotent or not. All {{glossary("Safe/HTTP", "safe")}} methods are idempotent, as well as {{HTTPMethod("PUT")}} and {{HTTPMethod("DELETE")}}. The {{HTTPMethod("POST")}} and {{HTTPMethod("PATCH")}} methods are not guaranteed to be idempotent.

A client can safely retry a request that uses an idempotent method, for example, in cases where there is doubt as to whether the request reached the server. If multiple identical requests happen to reach the server, as long as the method is idempotent, no harm is done.

The HTTP specification only defines idempotency in terms of the _intended_ effect of the client on the server. For example, a `POST` request intends to send data to the server, whereas a `DELETE` request intends to delete a resource on the server. In practice, it falls to the server to make sure the routes it exposes adhere to these semantics.

> [!NOTE]
> While servers are very much encouraged to adhere to the semantics laid out by the HTTP specification, the spec does not mandate it. Nothing is preventing a server in the wild from exposing a non-idempotent endpoint under an idempotent HTTP method, although clients may be surprised.

Also, bear in mind:

- A request with an idempotent method does not necessarily mean that the request has _no_ side effects on the server, only that the client intended none: For example, the server may log the time each request is received.
- The response returned by each request may differ: for example, the first call of a {{HTTPMethod("DELETE")}} will likely return a {{HTTPStatus("200")}}, while successive ones will likely return a {{HTTPStatus("404")}}.

## Examples

`GET /pageX HTTP/1.1` is idempotent, because it is a safe (read-only) method. Successive calls may return different data to the client, if the data on the server was updated in the meantime.

`POST /add_row HTTP/1.1` is not idempotent; if it is called several times, it adds several rows:

```http
POST /add_row HTTP/1.1
POST /add_row HTTP/1.1   -> Adds a 2nd row
POST /add_row HTTP/1.1   -> Adds a 3rd row
```

`DELETE /idX/delete HTTP/1.1` is idempotent, even if the returned status code may change between requests:

```http
DELETE /idX/delete HTTP/1.1   -> Returns 200 if idX exists
DELETE /idX/delete HTTP/1.1   -> Returns 404 as it just got deleted
DELETE /idX/delete HTTP/1.1   -> Returns 404
```

# Identifier

An **identifier** is a sequence of characters in the code that identifies a {{glossary("variable")}}, {{glossary("function")}}, or {{glossary("property")}}. In most languages, identifiers are case-sensitive and not quoted.

In {{glossary("JavaScript")}}, identifiers can contain {{glossary("Unicode")}} letters, `$`, `_`, and digits (0-9), but may not start with a digit. An identifier differs from a string in that a {{glossary("string")}} is data, while an identifier is part of the code. In JavaScript, there is no way to convert identifiers to strings, but sometimes it is possible to parse strings into identifiers.

In {{glossary("CSS")}}, there are two identifier data types: {{cssxref("custom-ident")}} and {{cssxref("dashed-ident")}}. The CSS {{cssxref("ident")}} can contain almost any character, but non-letter/digit ASCII characters such as `"`, `\`, and `*` must be escaped, it must not start with a digit, and emojis are valid as identifiers that do not require escaping.

# Identity provider (IdP)

An **identity provider** (IdP) is an entity in a {{glossary("federated identity")}} system that manages a user's {{glossary("credential", "credentials")}} and can {{glossary("authentication", "authenticate")}} users.

In federated identity systems, {{glossary("relying party", "relying parties")}}, that need to control access to a resource (for example, a website deciding whether to sign a user in) outsource the act of authenticating users to a third party, which they trust to make authentication decisions. These third parties are called identity providers.

Examples of identity providers on the web include Google, Microsoft, and Facebook. This enables websites to allow users to sign in using the user's Google, Microsoft, or Facebook account.

# IDL

An **IDL** (_Interface Description Language_) is a generic language, used to specify object interfaces independent of any particular programming language.

## Content versus IDL attributes

In HTML, most attributes have two faces: the **content attribute** and the **IDL attribute**.

The content attribute is the attribute as you set it from the content (the HTML code) and you can set it or get it via {{domxref("element.setAttribute()")}} or {{domxref("element.getAttribute()")}}. The content attribute is always a string even when the expected value should be an integer. For example, to set an {{HTMLElement("input")}} element's `maxlength` to 42 using the content attribute, you have to call `setAttribute("maxlength", "42")` on that element.

The IDL attribute is also known as a JavaScript property. These are the attributes you can read or set using JavaScript properties like `element.foo`. The IDL attribute is always going to use (but might transform) the underlying content attribute to return a value when you get it and is going to save something in the content attribute when you set it. In other words, the IDL attributes, in essence, reflect the content attributes.

Most of the time, IDL attributes will return their values as they are really used. For example, the default `type` for {{HTMLElement("input")}} elements is "text", so if you set `input.type="foobar"`, the `<input>` element will be of type text (in the appearance and the behavior) but the "type" content attribute's value will be "foobar". However, the `type` IDL attribute will return the string "text".

IDL attributes are not always strings; for example, `input.maxlength` is a number (a signed long). When using IDL attributes, you read or set values of the desired type, so `input.maxlength` is always going to return a number and when you set `input.maxlength`, it wants a number. If you pass another type, it is automatically converted to a number as specified by the standard JavaScript rules for type conversion.

IDL attributes can [reflect other types](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/urls-and-fetching.html#reflecting-content-attributes-in-idl-attributes) such as unsigned long, URLs, booleans, etc. Unfortunately, there are no clear rules and the way IDL attributes behave in conjunction with their corresponding content attributes depends on the attribute. Most of the time, it will follow [the rules laid out in the specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/urls-and-fetching.html#reflecting-content-attributes-in-idl-attributes), but sometimes it doesn't. HTML specifications try to make this as developer-friendly as possible, but for various reasons (mostly historical), some attributes behave oddly (`select.size`, for example) and you should read the specifications to understand how exactly they behave.

# IETF

The Internet Engineering Task Force (**IETF**) is a worldwide organization that drafts {{glossary('specification','specifications')}} governing the mechanisms behind the {{glossary("Internet")}}, especially the {{glossary("TCP")}}/{{glossary("IPv6","IP")}} or Internet {{glossary("Protocol")}} Suite.

The IETF is open, run by volunteers, and sponsored by the [Internet Society](https://www.internetsociety.org/).

# IIFE

An **IIFE** (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is an idiom in which a {{glossary("JavaScript")}} {{glossary("function")}} runs as soon as it is defined. It is also known as a _self-executing anonymous function_. The name IIFE is promoted by Ben Alman in [his blog](https://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/#iife).

```js
// standard IIFE
(function () {
  // statements…
})();

// arrow function variant
(() => {
  // statements…
})();

// async IIFE
(async () => {
  // statements…
})();
```

It contains two major parts:

1. A [function _expression_](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function). This usually needs to be [enclosed in parentheses](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Grouping) in order to be parsed correctly.
2. Immediately _calling_ the function expression. Arguments may be provided, though IIFEs without arguments are more common.

IIFEs are a common pattern used to execute arbitrarily many statements in their own scope (and possibly return a value), in a location that requires a single expression. They are similar to, but much more powerful than, the [comma operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comma_operator), which can only execute multiple expressions and, therefore, does not provide a way to use local variables or control flow statements.

Use cases of IIFEs include:

- Avoiding polluting the global namespace by creating a new {{glossary("scope")}}.
- Creating a new async context to use {{jsxref("Operators/await", "await")}} in a non-async context.
- Computing values with complex logic, such as using multiple statements as a single expression.

For code examples, see the [`function` expression](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function) and [`async function` expression](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/async_function) reference pages.

# IMAP

IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is a {{Glossary("protocol")}} used to retrieve and store emails. More recent than {{Glossary("POP")}}, IMAP allows folders and rules on the server.

Unlike POP3, IMAP allows multiple simultaneous connections to one mailbox. Clients accessing a mailbox can receive information about state changes made from other clients. IMAP also provides a mode for clients to stay connected and receive information on demand.

Mark Crispin initially developed IMAP in 1986 as _Interim Mail Access Protocol_. IMAP4 revision 1 is the current version, defined by [RFC 3501](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc3501).

# Immutable

An **immutable** value is one whose content cannot be changed without creating an entirely new value, in comparison with {{Glossary("mutable", "mutable values")}}.

In {{glossary("JavaScript")}}, {{Glossary("primitive", "primitive values")}} are immutable — once a primitive value is created, it cannot be changed, although the variable that holds it may be reassigned another value.
By contrast, {{Glossary("Object","objects")}} and {{Glossary("Array","arrays")}} are mutable by default — their properties and elements can be changed without reassigning a new value.

It can be beneficial to use immutable objects for several reasons:

- To improve performance (no planning for the object's future changes)
- To reduce memory use (make {{glossary("object reference","object references")}} instead of cloning the whole object)
- Thread-safety (multiple threads can reference the same object without interfering with one other)
- Lower developer mental burden (the object's state won't change and its behavior is always consistent)

Note that you can easily prove mutability: an object is mutable as long as it offers one way to change its properties. On the other hand, _immutability_ is hard to prove if there are no language semantics to secure it — it is a matter of developer contract. For example, {{jsxref("Object.freeze()")}} is a language-level method to make an object immutable in JavaScript.

# IndexedDB

IndexedDB is a Web {{glossary("API")}} for storing large data structures within browsers and indexing them for high-performance searching. Like an {{glossary("SQL")}}-based [RDBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system), IndexedDB is a transactional database system. However, it uses {{glossary("JavaScript")}} objects rather than fixed columns tables to store data.

# Information architecture

Information architecture, as applied to web design and development, is the practice of organizing the information / content / functionality of a website so that it presents the best user experience it can, with information and services being easily usable and findable.

# Inheritance

Inheritance is a major feature of {{glossary("OOP","object-oriented programming")}}. Data abstraction can be carried up several levels, that is, {{glossary("class","classes")}} can have superclasses and subclasses.

As an app developer, you can choose which of the superclass's {{glossary("attribute","attributes")}} and {{glossary("method","methods")}} to keep and add your own, making class definition very flexible. Some languages let a class inherit from more than one parent (multiple inheritance).

# Ink overflow

The **ink overflow** of a box refers to the part of the box and its contents that creates a visual effect outside of the box's border box. Being visual only, ink overflow does not affect layout as it has no impact on box model properties.

Ink overflow is the overflow of painting effects such as [box shadows](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow), [border images](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_backgrounds_and_borders), [text decoration](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_text_decoration), [outlines](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/outline), etc. that do not affect layout or otherwise extend the scrollable overflow area. Ink overflow is also the overhanging of glyphs, such as ascenders and descenders extending outside the em box.

As {{ glossary("replaced elements")}} always establish an independent [formatting context](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Introduction_to_formatting_contexts), any overflow of replaced content is always ink overflow (as opposed to [scrollable overflow](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Overflow)).

# Inline-level content

In CSS, content that participates in inline layout is called **inline-level content**. Most text sequences, replaced elements, and generated content are inline-level by default.

In inline layout, a mixed stream of text, {{ glossary("replaced elements")}}, and other inline boxes are laid out by fragmenting them into a stack of line boxes. Within each line box, inline-level boxes are aligned to each other vertically or horizontally, depending on the writing mode. Typically, they are aligned by the baselines of their text. This can be changed with CSS.

![inline layout](inline_layout.png)

> [!NOTE]
> HTML (_HyperText Markup Language_) elements historically were categorized as either "block-level" elements or "inline" elements. As a presentational characteristic, this is now specified by CSS.

## Examples

```html
<p>
  This span is an <span class="highlight">inline-level element</span>; its
  background has been colored to display both the beginning and end of the
  element's influence. Input elements, like <input type="radio" /> and
  <input type="checkbox" />, are also inline-level content.
</p>
```

In this example, the {{HTMLElement("p")}} element contains some text. Within that text is a {{HTMLElement("span")}} element and two {{HTMLElement("input")}} elements, which are inline-level elements. If the `<span>` is spread across two lines, two line boxes are generated. Because these elements are inline, the paragraph correctly renders as a single paragraph of unbroken text flow:

```css hidden
body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 4px;
  border: 1px solid #333333;
}

.highlight {
  background-color: #eeee33;
}
```

# Input method editor

An Input Method Editor (IME) is a program that provides a specialized user interface for text input. Input method editors are used in many situations:

- To enter Chinese, Japanese, or Korean text using a Latin keyboard.
- To enter Latin text using a numeric keypad.
- To enter text on a touch screen using handwriting recognition.

# Inset properties

In CSS, **inset properties** control positioned elements' location by specifying offsets from the elements' default positions. There are physical, logical, and shorthand inset properties.

The inset properties include the {{cssxref("top")}}, {{cssxref("left")}}, {{cssxref("bottom")}}, and {{cssxref("right")}} physical properties, their {{cssxref("inset-block-start")}}, {{cssxref("inset-block-end")}}, {{cssxref("inset-inline-start")}}, and {{cssxref("inset-inline-end")}} flow-relative {{glossary("logical properties", "logical property")}} equivalents, and the {{cssxref("inset-block")}}, {{cssxref("inset-inline")}}, and {{cssxref("inset")}} shorthands.

**Physical properties** reference specific physical sides of an element. Logical properties use directional keywords relative to the block and inline axes. **Block axis** refers to the axis that defines the stacking order of elements in a block layout. The **inline axis** is perpendicular to the block axis, representing the direction along which inline content like text flows within a block. The mapping depends on the element's {{cssxref("writing-mode")}}, {{cssxref("direction")}}, and {{cssxref("text-orientation")}}.

The interpretation of inset properties depends on the value of the {{cssxref("position")}} property. When `position: absolute` is set, they represent insets from the [containing block](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Containing_block) or [anchor element](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning/Using). With `position: relative`, they represent insets from the box's default margin edge position. With `sticky`, they represent insets from the {{glossary("scroll container")}} edge. The `fixed` value is similar to `absolute`, except the element is positioned and sized relative to its fixed positioning containing block, which is often the viewport.

# Interaction to Next Paint (INP)

**Interaction to Next Paint** (INP) measures the responsiveness of a website to user interactions (for example, when they click a link, tap on a button, or use a custom, JavaScript-powered control).

INP was designed by Google as one of the [Core Web Vital](https://web.dev/articles/vitals) metrics, replacing {{Glossary("First Input Delay")}} (FID) in May 2024. There are two key differences between FID and INP that make INP a more reliable measure of a page's responsiveness:

- FID measures only the first user interaction, whereas INP considers all user interactions.
- FID only measures the input delay of the interaction, whereas INP measures for a longer period: beginning at the input delay, followed by the time it takes to process event handlers, and the browser's presentation time until the browser has painted the next frame.

INP measures the worst length of time (minus some outliers), in milliseconds, between the user interaction on a web page and the next frame presentation after that interaction is processed. Scrolling and zooming are not included in this metric. INP is calculated using the [Event Timing API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceEventTiming). Asynchronous operations such as network fetches or file reads usually do not delay INP as painting can occur while such operations are handled.

All eligible interactions throughout the page lifetime are considered. For highly interactive pages of 50 or more interactions, the 98th percentile is used to exclude some extreme outliers that are not reflective of overall page responsiveness.

The longer the delay, the worse the user experience. The [Long Animation Frames API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API/Long_animation_frame_timing) can help identify causes of high INP.

# Internationalization (i18n)

**Internationalization**, often shortened to "i18n", is the practice of designing a system in such a way that it can easily be adapted for different target audiences, that may vary in region, language, or culture.

The complementary process of adapting a system for a specific target audience is called {{glossary("Localization")}}.

Among other things, internationalization covers adapting to differences in:

- writing systems
- units of measure (currency, °C/°F, km/miles, etc.)
- time and date formats
- keyboard layouts

The work of the [Unicode Consortium](https://home.unicode.org/) is a fundamental part of internationalization. Unicode supports not only variations among the world's writing systems but also cultural variations such as currencies and time/date formats.

# Interpolation

Interpolation is a method for estimating new data points based on a set of known data points.

Interpolation calculates intermediate values in animations that change HTML properties such as height, width, etc.
Color interpolation defines intermediate values of colors in color mixing, gradients, compositing, filters, transitions, animations, and color functions.

Interpolations aren't necessarily linear. Most interpolated values are real, floating-point numbers; however, when there is no mid-point between two values, such as values that accept only integers, the [interpolation is discrete](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/integer#interpolation). The progression of interpolation also depends on [easing functions](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/easing-function) in animations and color stops, and {{CSSXref("color-interpolation-method", "color")}} and {{CSSXref("hue-interpolation-method", "hue")}} interpolation methods in gradients.

In JavaScript, the term "[interpolation](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#string_interpolation)" is used as a description of the substitution of strings in the template literals.

# Intrinsic size

In CSS, the **intrinsic size** of an element is the size it would have based purely on its content, without taking into account the effects of the layout context it appears in. This is the opposite of an element's {{glossary("extrinsic size")}}, which is determined by external constraints such as container size. An element's intrinsic sizes are represented by its {{cssxref("min-content")}} and {{cssxref("max-content")}} sizes.

Inline elements are sized intrinsically. CSS [box model](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Box_model) properties such as {{cssxref("height")}}, {{cssxref("width")}}, {{cssxref("block-size")}}, {{cssxref("inline-size")}}, {{cssxref("padding-block")}}, and {{cssxref("margin-block")}} have no impact on their layout (though {{cssxref("margin-inline")}} and {{cssxref("padding-inline")}} do affect spacing within a line).

For example, the minimum intrinsic size of the inline {{htmlelement("span")}} element is the smallest size it would have if it were floated (with no other CSS box properties applied) in a container with `inline-size: 0`. The maximum intrinsic size is the opposite; it's the size the same `<span>` would have when placed in a container with an infinite `inline-size`.

Intrinsic size has the same meaning for images as for text — the size at which the images are displayed if no CSS is applied to change the rendering.

Pixel density and resolution affect intrinsic size. By default, images are assumed to have a "1x" pixel density (1 device pixel = 1 CSS pixel), in which case the intrinsic size is simply the pixel height and width. An image's intrinsic size and resolution can be explicitly specified in its {{Glossary("EXIF")}} data. Image pixel density may also be set for images using the [`srcset`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/img#srcset) attribute. Note that if both mechanisms are used, the `srcset` value is applied "over" the EXIF value.

Intrinsic sizes and how they are calculated are defined in the [CSS box sizing](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_box_sizing) module.

## Minimum intrinsic size

To set an element according to its minimum intrinsic size, set the {{cssxref("inline-size")}} (or {{cssxref("width")}} in horizontal writing modes, like English and Hebrew) to {{cssxref("min-content")}}. This sets the element to the size it would be if the text was wrapped as small as possible in the inline direction without causing an overflow, with as much soft-wrapping as possible. For a box containing a string of text, the minimum intrinsic size would be defined by the longest word.

```html hidden
<p>Text wraps, making the element only as wide as its longest word.</p>
```

```css
p {
  inline-size: min-content;
  background-color: palegoldenrod;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('minimum intrinsic size', '100%', '220')}}

## Maximum intrinsic size

The maximum intrinsic size is the opposite. It is the element's size if the container's inline size were infinite. Text content would display as wide as possible, with no soft-wrapping, even if it overflows its container. The keyword value {{cssxref("max-content")}} sets this behavior.

```html hidden
<p>Element grows as text doesn't wrap.</p>
<p>
  This paragraph may be wider than the width of the entire page and yet it won't
  wrap because <code>width: max-content</code> is set. It therefore may overflow
  its container.
</p>
```

```css
p {
  width: max-content;
  background-color: palegoldenrod;
}
```

# Invariant

In program semantics, an **invariant** of a piece of code is a condition that is provably true throughout the execution of that code. Defining invariants helps to reason about the code's correctness and behavior.

For example, in the following code:

```js
let count = 0;
while (hasMessages()) {
  count++;
  processMessage();
}
```

We can prove that `count` is a non-negative integer from the beginning to the end. This means that anywhere in the code, we can pass `count` to a function that expects a non-negative integer, and the function will work correctly.

Invariants can be established in two ways: by the nature of the program, or by explicit assertions (runtime checks). For example, the code above does not perform any checks, but by virtue of `count` being an incrementing integer starting from `0`, we can guarantee its range. If we are receiving input from an external source, we can use checks to establish invariants at the boundary:

```js
function processInput(input) {
  if (input < 0 || !Number.isInteger(input)) {
    throw new Error("Input must be a non-negative integer");
  }
  // Process input...
}
```

Invariants are particularly useful in complex systems that cannot afford to perform exhaustive checks at every step. We establish invariants at the system boundary, and then any following code can assume those properties without checking them again.

In general, anything that can be assumed to be true is an invariant. For example, a specification can leave a feature as implementation-defined but with certain invariants, meaning those properties will always hold true regardless of the exact behavior.
# IP Address

An **IP address** is a number used to address each device on an IP network uniquely.

_IP_ stands for _Internet Protocol_ which is the [protocol layer](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/806-4075/ipov-7/index.html) with which the address is associated.

"IP address" typically still refers to 32-bit IPv4 addresses until IPv6 is deployed more broadly.

- [IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) on Wikipedia
# IPv4

IPv4 is the fourth version of the communication {{Glossary("protocol")}} underlying the {{glossary("Internet")}} and the first version to be widely deployed.

First formalized in 1981, IPv4 traces its roots to the initial development work for ARPAnet. IPv4 is a connectionless protocol to be used on packet-switched Link layer networks (ethernet). {{glossary("IPv6")}} is gradually replacing IPv4 owing to IPv4's security problems and the limitations of its address field. (Version number 5 was assigned in 1979 to the experimental Internet Stream Protocol, which however has never been called IPv5.)

## See also

- [IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4) on Wikipedia
# IPv6

**IPv6** is the current version of the communication {{glossary("protocol")}} underlying the {{glossary("Internet")}}. Slowly IPv6 is replacing {{Glossary("IPv4")}}, among other reasons because IPv6 allows for many different {{Glossary("IP address","IP addresses")}}.

# IRC

**IRC** (_Internet Relay Chat_) is a worldwide chat system requiring an Internet connection and an IRC client, which sends and receives messages via the IRC server.

Designed in the late 1980s by Jarkko Oikarinen, IRC uses {{glossary("TCP")}} and is an open protocol. The IRC server broadcasts messages to everyone connected to one of many IRC channels (each with its own ID).

# ITU

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is the organization authorized by the United Nations to establish standards and rules for telecommunication, including telegraph, radio, telephony and the internet.

From defining rules for ensuring transmissions get to where they need to go to and creating the "SOS" alert signal used in Morse code, the ITU has long played a key role in how we use technology to exchange information and ideas.

In the Internet Age, the ITU's role of establishing standards for video and audio data formats used for streaming, teleconferencing, and other purposes. For example, the ITU and the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) worked together to develop and publish, as well as to maintain, the various MPEG specifications, such as MPEG-2 (ITU H.262), AVC (ITU H.264), and HEVC (ITU H.265).

# Jank

**Jank** refers to sluggishness in a user interface, usually caused by executing long tasks on the main thread, blocking rendering, or expending too much processor power on background processes.
# Java

Java is a {{glossary("Compile", "compiled")}}, {{glossary("OOP", "object-oriented")}}, highly portable {{Glossary("computer programming", "programming")}} language.

Java is statically typed and features a similar syntax to C. It comes with a large library of readily usable functions, the Java Software Development Kit (SDK).

Programs are {{glossary("Compile", "compiled")}} only once ahead of time into a proprietary byte code and package format that runs inside the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The JVM is available across many platforms, which allows Java programs to run almost everywhere without the need to be compiled or packaged again. This makes it a preferred language in many large enterprises with heterogeneous landscapes, but may be perceived "heavy".

# JavaScript

JavaScript (or "JS") is a programming language used most often for dynamic client-side scripts on webpages, but it is also often used on the {{Glossary("Server","server")}}-side, using a runtime such as {{Glossary("Node.js")}}, {{Glossary("Deno")}}, and [Bun](https://bun.sh/).

JavaScript **should not** be confused with the [Java programming language](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)>). Although _"Java"_ and _"JavaScript"_ are trademarks (or registered trademarks) of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries, the two programming languages are significantly different in their syntax, semantics, and use cases.

JavaScript is primarily used in the browser, enabling developers to manipulate webpage content through the {{Glossary("DOM")}}, retrieve content from servers using the {{domxref("Window/fetch", "fetch()")}} API, store complex data using {{Glossary("IndexedDB")}}, draw graphics with {{Glossary("canvas")}}, interact with the device running the browser through various {{Glossary("API","APIs")}}, and more. JavaScript is one of the world's most commonly-used languages, owing to the recent growth and performance improvement of {{Glossary("API","APIs")}} available in browsers.

## Origins and History

Conceived as a server-side language by Brendan Eich (then employed by the Netscape Corporation), JavaScript soon came to Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995. JavaScript enjoyed immediate success and {{glossary("Microsoft Internet Explorer", "Internet Explorer 3.0")}} introduced JavaScript support under the name JScript in August 1996.

In November 1996, Netscape began working with Ecma International to make JavaScript an industry standard. Since then, the standardized JavaScript is called ECMAScript and specified under ECMA-262. The standard is constantly updated and implemented (a _living standard_).

Recently, JavaScript's popularity has expanded even further through the successful [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) platform—the most popular cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment outside the browser. Node.js - built using [Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)>) - allows developers to use JavaScript as a scripting language to automate things on a computer and build fully functional {{Glossary("HTTP")}} and {{Glossary("WebSockets")}} servers.

# Jitter

**Jitter** is the term used in computer networking to refer to [packet delay variation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_delay_variation) — the variance in the rate at which packets arrive at a destination (the average of the squared difference from the mean packet arrival rate).

"High jitter" indicates that packets are arriving at significantly varying rates, possibly due to network congestion, packet loss, and routing of packets in a stream through different paths.
High jitter can significantly degrade the performance of real-time web applications, including voice/video streaming and online gaming.

## Jitter buffer

Network protocols and applications, such as WebRTC, use a "jitter buffer" to mitigate the effects of packet delay variation.
Jitter buffers temporarily store incoming packets and then release them at a steady, synchronized rate.
They may also use forward error correction to fix corrupted packets, re-request missing packets, [insert audio samples to conceal missing packets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_loss_concealment), slow down or speed up sample playout, and so on.
This process smooths out the arrival times of packets and ensures a more consistent playout of real-time audio and video.

# JPEG

**JPEG** (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is a commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images.

JPEG compression is composed of three compression techniques applied in successive layers, including chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transformation and quantization, and run-length Delta & Huffman encoding. Chroma subsampling involves implementing less resolution for chroma information than for luma information, taking advantage of the human visual system's lower acuity for color differences than for luminance. A discrete cosine transform expresses a finite sequence of data points in terms of a sum of cosine functions oscillating at different frequencies.

# JSON

_JavaScript Object Notation_ (**JSON**) is a data-interchange format. Although not a strict subset, JSON closely resembles a subset of {{Glossary("JavaScript")}} syntax. Though many programming languages support JSON, it is especially useful for JavaScript-based apps, including websites and browser extensions.

JSON can represent numbers, booleans, strings, `null`, arrays (ordered sequences of values), and objects (string-value mappings) made up of these values (or of other arrays and objects). JSON does not natively represent more complex data types like functions, regular expressions, dates, and so on. (Date objects by default serialize to a string containing the date in ISO format, so the information isn't completely lost.) If you need JSON to represent additional data types, transform values as they are serialized or before they are deserialized.

# JSON type representation

{{glossary("JSON")}} is a convenient and widely used format for serializing objects, arrays, numbers, strings, booleans, and null.
[JSON does not support all data types allowed by JavaScript](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON#javascript_and_json_differences), which means that JavaScript objects that use these incompatible types cannot be directly serialized to JSON.

The _JSON type representation_ of a JSON-incompatible object is an equivalent JavaScript object with properties encoded such that the information _can_ be serialized to JSON.
This typically has the same properties as the original object for compatible data types, while incompatible properties are converted/serialized to compatible types.
For example, buffer properties in the original object might be {{Glossary("base64", "base64url")}}-encoded to strings in the JSON-type representation.

An object that cannot automatically be serialized to JSON using the [`JSON.stringify()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) method can define an instance method named `toJSON()` that returns the _JSON-type representation_ of the original object.
[`JSON.stringify()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) will then use `toJSON()` to get the object to stringify, instead of the original object.
[`PublicKeyCredential.toJSON()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/PublicKeyCredential/toJSON) and [`Performance.toJSON()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/toJSON) are examples of this approach.

A JSON string serialized in this way can be deserialized back to the _JSON-type representation_ object using [`JSON.parse()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse).
It is common to provide a converter method, such as {{domxref("PublicKeyCredential.parseCreationOptionsFromJSON_static", "PublicKeyCredential.parseCreationOptionsFromJSON()")}}, to convert the _JSON-type representation_ back to the original object.
# Just-In-Time Compilation (JIT)

**JIT** (_Just-In-Time Compilation_) is a {{glossary("compile", "compilation")}} process in which code is translated from an intermediate representation or a higher-level language (e.g., {{glossary("JavaScript")}} or Java bytecode) into machine code _at runtime_, rather than prior to execution. This approach combines the benefits of both interpretation and ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation.

JIT compilers typically continuously analyze the code as it is executed, identifying parts of the code that are executed frequently (hot spots). If the speedup gains outweigh the compilation overhead, then the JIT compilers will compile those parts into machine code. The compiled code is then executed directly by the processor, which can result in significant performance improvements.

JIT is commonly used in modern {{glossary("browser", "web browsers")}} to optimize the performance of JavaScript code.

# Kebab case

**Kebab case** is a way of writing phrases without spaces, where spaces are replaced with hyphens `-`, and the words are typically all lower case. The name comes from the similarity of the words to meat on a kebab skewer. It's often stylized as "kebab-case" to remind the reader of its appearance.

Kebab casing is often used as a variable naming convention. However, in many languages, hyphens represent subtraction, so kebab casing is not an option. CSS properties such as {{cssxref("background-color")}} and {{cssxref("font-family")}} are in kebab case, and so are HTML attributes such as [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) and [`data-*`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/data-*).

Kebab-cased words are often simply referred to as _hyphenated_.

# Key

A key is a piece of information used by a {{Glossary("cipher")}} for {{Glossary("encryption")}} and/or {{Glossary("decryption")}}.

Encrypted messages should remain secure even if everything about the cryptosystem, except for the key, is public knowledge.

In {{Glossary("symmetric-key cryptography")}}, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
This key is referred to as the _shared key_, or the _secret key_.

In {{Glossary("public-key cryptography")}}, there exists a pair of related keys known as the _public key_ and _private key_. The public key is freely available, whereas the private key is kept secret. The public key is able to encrypt messages that only the corresponding private key is able to decrypt, and vice versa.

# Keyword

A **keyword** is a word or phrase that describes content. Online keywords are used as queries for search engines or as words identifying content on websites.

When you use a search engine, you use keywords to specify what you are looking for, and the search engine returns relevant webpages. For more accurate results, try more specific keywords, such as "Blue Mustang GTO" instead of "Mustang". Webpages also use keywords in a meta tag (in the {{htmlelement("head")}} section) to describe page content, so search engines can better identify and organize webpages.

# The Khronos Group

**The Khronos Group** is an open, non-profit, member-driven consortium of over 150 industry-leading companies. Their purpose is to create advanced, royalty-free interoperability standards for 3D graphics, augmented and virtual reality, parallel programming, vision acceleration, and machine learning.

The organization maintains standards such as {{Glossary("OpenGL")}} and the [WebGL API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API).

# Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

The **Largest Contentful Paint** (LCP) performance metric provides the render time of the largest image or text block visible within the viewport, recorded from when the page first begins to load.

The following elements are considered when determining the LCP:

- {{HTMLElement("img")}} elements.
- [`<image>`](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/image) elements inside an SVG.
- The poster images of {{HTMLElement("video")}} elements.
- Elements with a {{cssxref("background-image")}}.
- Groups of text nodes, such as {{HTMLElement("p")}}.

# Latency

**Latency** is the network time it takes for a requested resource to reach its destination. Low latency is good, meaning there is little or no delay. High latency is bad, meaning it takes a long time for the requested resource to reach its destination.

Latency can be a factor in any kind of data flow, but is most commonly discussed in terms of network latency (the time it takes for a packet of data to travel from source to destination) and media codec latency (the time it takes for the source data to be encoded or decoded and reach the consumer of the resulting data).

## See also

- [Understanding Latency](/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Guides/Understanding_latency)
# Layout mode

A **layout mode**, sometimes called _layout_, is a [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) algorithm that determines the position and size of element boxes based on the way they interact with their sibling and ancestor boxes.

There are several layout modes:

- **[Flow layout or normal flow](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Flow_layout)**
  - : All elements are part of normal flow until you do something to take them out of it.Normal flow includes:
    - **[Block layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Block_and_inline_layout_in_normal_flow)**
      - : Designed for laying out boxes such as paragraphs.
    - **[Inline layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_inline_layout)**
      - : Designed for laying out inline items such as text.

- **[Table layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_table)**
  - : Designed for laying out tables.
- **Float layout**
  - : Designed to cause an item to position itself left or right with the rest of the content in normal flow wrapping around it.
- **[Positioned layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_positioned_layout)**
  - : Designed for positioning elements without much interaction with other elements.
- **[Multi-column layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_multicol_layout)**
  - : Designed for laying content out in columns as in a newspaper.
- **[Flexible box layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout)**
  - : Designed for laying out complex pages that can be resized smoothly.
- **[Grid layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout)**
  - : Designed for laying out elements relative to a fixed grid.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all [CSS properties](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) apply to all _layout modes_. Most of them apply to one or two of them and have no effect if they are set on an element participating in another layout mode.

# Layout viewport

The **layout viewport** is the {{glossary("viewport")}} into which the browser draws a web page. Essentially, it represents what is available to be seen, whereas the {{Glossary("visual viewport")}} represents the currently visible portion of the layout viewport, the currently visible subsection of the layout viewport that is currently visible on the user's display device.

This becomes important, for example, on mobile devices, where a pinching gesture can usually be used to zoom in and out on a site's contents. The rendered document doesn't change in any way, so the layout viewport remains the same as the user adjusts the zoom level. Instead, the visual viewport is updated to indicate the area of the page that they can see.

# Lazy load

**Lazy loading** is a strategy that delays the loading of some assets (e.g., images) until they are needed by the user based on the user's activity and navigation pattern; typically, these assets are only loaded when they are scrolled into view.

If correctly implemented, this delay in asset loading is seamless to the user experience and might help improve initial load performance, including {{Glossary("time to interactive")}}, as fewer assets are required for the page to start working.

- [Lazy loading](/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Guides/Lazy_loading)
# Leading

In typography, **leading** is an amount of space included above and below text to provide spacing between lines. Historically, in physical typesetting, pieces of actual [lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead) were used to implement this spacing, which is where the name comes from.

In CSS, typographic leading is the difference between the content height and the line-height, generally set by the {{cssxref("line-height")}} property. Leading set via `line-height` provides spacing between lines, which can be negative. The space is distributed equally above and below the text, which is referred to as **half-leading**.

The area of a font above the cap baseline is referred to as the _over edge_. The area below the {{glossary("/Baseline/Typography", "alphabetic baseline")}} is referred to as the _under edge_. Likewise, the half-leading above and below a line is referred to as the _over leading_ and _under leading_, respectively.

The half-leading can be trimmed from the block-start edge and block-end edge of a text element's block container using the {{cssxref("text-box")}} properties.

LGPL (GNU Lesser General Public License) is a free software license published by the Free Software Foundation. The LGPL provides a more permissive alternative for the strictly {{Glossary("copyleft")}} {{Glossary("GPL")}}. While any derivative work using a GPL-licensed program must be released under the same terms (free to use, share, study, and modify), the LGPL only requires the LGPL-licensed component of the derivative program to continue using the LGPL, not the whole program. LGPL is usually used to license shared components such as libraries (`.dll`, `.so`, `.jar`, etc.).

# Ligature

A **ligature** is a joining of two characters into one shape. For example, in French "œ" is a ligature of "oe".

# Literal

**Literals** represent values in JavaScript. These are fixed values—not variables—that you _literally_ provide in your script.

- [Array literals](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#array_literals)
- [Boolean literals](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#boolean_literals)

- [RegExp literals](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#regexp_literals)
- [String literals](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#string_literals)

## Examples

### String literals

A string literal is zero or more characters enclosed in double (`"`) or single quotation marks (`'`). A string must be delimited by quotation marks of the same type (that is, either both single quotation marks, or both double quotation marks).

The following are examples of string literals:

```js
"foo";
"bar";
"1234";
"one line \n new line";
"Joyo's cat";
```

### Object literals

An object literal is a list of zero or more pairs of property names and associated values of an object, enclosed in curly braces (`{}`).

The following is an example of an object literal. The first element of the `car` object defines a property, `myCar`, and assigns to it a new string, `"Toyota"`; the second element, the `getCar` property, is immediately assigned the result of invoking the function `carTypes('Honda')`; the third element, the `special` property, uses an existing variable (`sales`).

```js
const sales = "BMW";

function carTypes(name) {
  return name === "Honda" ? name : `Sorry, we don't sell ${name}.`;
}

const car = {
  myCar: "Toyota",
  getCar: carTypes("Honda"),
  special: sales,
};

console.log(car.myCar); // Toyota
console.log(car.getCar); // Honda
console.log(car.special); // BMW
```

# Locale

**Locale** is a set of language- or country-based preferences for a user interface.

A program draws its locale settings from the language of the host system. Among other things, locales represent paper format, currency, date format, and numbers according to the protocols in the given region.

## See also

- [Locale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locale) on Wikipedia
# Localization

**Localization** (l10n) is the process of adapting a software user interface to a specific culture.

The following are common factors to consider:

- language
- unit of measure (e.g., kilometers in Europe, miles in U.S.)
- text direction (e.g., European languages are left-to-right, Arabic right-to-left)
- capitalization in Latin script (e.g., English uses capitals for weekdays, Spanish uses lowercase)
- adaptation of idioms (e.g., "raining cats and dogs" makes no sense when translated literally)
- use of register (e.g., in Japanese respectful speech differs exceptionally from casual speech)
- number format (e.g., 10 000,00 in Germany vs. 10,000.00 in the U.S.)
- date format
- currency
- cultural references
- paper size
- color psychology
- compliance with local laws
- local holidays
- personal names

The complementary practice, of designing a system so it is easy to localize, is called {{glossary("Internationalization")}}.

# Logical properties

CSS **logical properties** provide a way to lay out content based on the document's writing mode and direction rather than the physical dimensions of the viewport. This enables more flexible and maintainable designs, especially for websites supporting multiple languages.

Whereas {{glossary("physical properties")}}, like {{cssxref("top")}}, {{cssxref("right")}}, {{cssxref("padding-bottom")}}, and {{cssxref("border-bottom-left-radius")}}, define positions and features based on physical directions and reference specific sides of an element, logical properties such as {{cssxref("inset-block-start")}}, {{cssxref("inset-inline-end")}}, {{cssxref("padding-block-end")}}, and {{cssxref("border-end-end-radius")}} use logical directional keywords that are relative to the content flow along the block and inline axes.

## Block direction

The **block axis** refers to the axis that defines the stacking order of elements in a block layout. It's essentially the direction along which blocks of content — like paragraphs ({{htmlelement("p")}}), headings, and divs ({{htmlelement("div")}}) — are laid out on a webpage. This is also known as the **block direction**. In left-to-right and left-to-right languages, the block direction is the vertical direction of the content flow, going from top to bottom.

The **block-start** and **block-end** directions represent the _start edge_ and _end edge_ of content along the block axis, or the "from" and "to" directions, respectively, with `block-start` being the equivalent of `top` and `block-end` being the equivalent of `bottom` in horizontal writing modes.

## Inline direction

The **inline axis** is perpendicular to the block axis. The inline axis represents the direction along which inline content such as text flows within a block. This is also known as the **inline direction**. In left-to-right writing modes, like English, the inline direction is horizontal, left-to-right. In right-to-left languages, like Arabic and Hebrew, the inline direction is horizontal, right-to-left.

**Inline-start** and **inline-end** represent the _start edge_ and _end edge_ of content along the inline axis, respectively, with the values and properties `inline-start` and `inline-end` being equivalent to `left` and `right` properties and values in horizontal writing modes. Which ones are equivalent to `right` or `left` depends on the writing direction — for example `inline-start` is `left` in left-to-right languages and `right` in right-to-left languages.

# Long task

A **long task** is a task that takes more than 50ms to complete.

It is an uninterrupted period where the {{Glossary("main thread", "main UI thread")}} is busy for 50 ms or longer. Common examples include long running event handlers, expensive {{Glossary("reflow", "reflows")}} and other re-renders, and work the browser does between different turns of the event loop that exceeds 50 ms.

## See also

- [Long Tasks API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceLongTaskTiming)
- [Long Animation Frames API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API/Long_animation_frame_timing)
# Loop

A **loop** is a sequence of instructions that is repeated until a certain condition is met. An example would be the process of getting an item of data and changing it, and then making sure some {{Glossary("conditional", "condition")}} is checked — such as if a counter has reached a prescribed number.

Loops are one way to execute a statement for a variable number of times. The same effect can be achieved with {{glossary("Recursion", "recursion")}}, especially in languages where all data is {{glossary("Immutable", "immutable")}}, making it impossible to update a counter variable.

# Lossless compression

**Lossless compression** is a class of data compression algorithms that allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data. Lossless compression methods are reversible. Examples of lossless compression include {{glossary("GZip_compression", "gzip")}}, {{glossary("Brotli_compression", "brotli")}}, {{glossary("Zstandard compression", "Zstandard")}}, {{glossary("WebP")}}, and {{glossary("PNG")}}.

{{glossary("Lossy compression")}}, on the other hand, uses inexact approximations by discarding some data from the original file, making it an irreversible compression method.
Compression methods such as {{glossary("WebP")}} are capable of [both lossy and lossless compression](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/compression) depending on the compression level or the options you want to use during encoding.

## See also

- Related glossary terms:
  - {{glossary("Lossy compression")}}
# Lossy compression

**Lossy compression**, or irreversible compression, is a data-compression method that uses inexact approximations and partial-data discarding to represent content. In simpler terms: lossy compression causes data from the initial file to be lost, possibly causing degradation in quality. The process of such compression is irreversible; once lossy compression of the content has been performed, the content cannot be restored to its original state. Therefore, content that has undergone lossy compression should generally not be further edited.

Lossy compression is widely used in image formats such as {{glossary("JPEG")}}, {{glossary("WebP")}}, and audio and video formats such as [MP3, MP4, H.264 and others](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/MIME_types/Common_types).
Compression methods such as {{glossary("WebP")}} are capable of [both lossy and lossless compression](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/compression) depending on the compression level or the options you want to use during encoding.

# LTR (Left To Right)

**LTR** (**Left To Right**) is a {{Glossary("locale")}} property indicating that text is written from left to right. For example, the `en-US` locale (for US English) specifies left-to-right.

Most Western languages, as well as many others around the world, are written LTR.

The opposite of LTR, {{Glossary("RTL")}} (Right To Left) is used in other common languages, including Arabic (`ar`) and Hebrew (`he`).

# Main axis

The main axis in {{glossary("flexbox")}} is defined by the direction set by the {{cssxref("flex-direction")}} property. There are four possible values for `flex-direction`. These are:

- `row`
- `row-reverse`
- `column`
- `column-reverse`

Should you choose `row` or `row-reverse` then your main axis will run along the row in the inline direction.

![In this image the flex-direction is row which forms the main axis](basics1.png)

Choose `column` or `column-reverse` and your main axis will run top to bottom of the page in the block direction.

![Three flex items taking up the full width of the container, displayed one below the other in code order. Flex-direction is set to column. The main axis is vertical i.e., from top to bottom](basics2.png)

On the main axis you can control the sizing of flex items by adding any available space to the items themselves, by way of `flex` properties on the items. Or, you can control the space between and around items by using the `justify-content` property.

# Main thread

The **main thread** is where a browser processes user events and paints. By default, the browser uses a single thread to run all the JavaScript in your page, as well as to perform layout, reflows, and garbage collection. This means that long-running JavaScript functions can block the thread, leading to an unresponsive page and a bad user experience.

Unless intentionally using a [web worker](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers), such as a [service worker](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers), JavaScript runs on the main thread, so it's easy for a script to cause delays in event processing or painting. The less work required of the main thread, the more that thread can respond to user events, paint, and generally be responsive to the user.

# Markup

A markup language is one that is designed for defining and presenting text. {{glossary("HTML")}} (HyperText Markup Language), is an example of a markup language.

Within a text file such as an HTML file, elements are _marked up_ using {{glossary("Tag","tags")}} which explain the purpose of that part of the content.

## Types of markup language

- **Presentational Markup:**
  - : Used by traditional word processing system with WYSIWYG (what you see it is what you get); this is hidden from human authors, users and editors.
- **Procedural Markup:**
  - : Combined with text to provide instructions on text processing to programs. This text is visibly manipulated by the author.
- **Descriptive Markup:**
  - : Labels sections of documents as to how the program should handle them. For example, the HTML {{HTMLElement("td")}} defines a cell in a HTML table.

**MathML** (an {{glossary("XML")}} application) is an open standard for representing mathematical expressions in webpages. In 1998 the W3C first recommended MathML for representing mathematical expressions in the {{glossary("browser")}}. MathML has other applications also including scientific content and voice synthesis.

# Media (Audio-visual presentation)

The term **media** (more accurately, **multimedia**) refers to audio, video, or combined audio-visual material such as music, recorded speech, movies, TV shows, or any other form of content that is presented over a period of time.

More broadly, media may include still images such as photographs or other still images.

Media content can be recorded, played back, presented, and at times interacted with in various ways.

# Media (CSS)

In the context of {{Glossary("CSS")}} (Cascading Style Sheets), the term **_media_** refers to the destination to which the document is to be drawn by the {{Glossary("Engine/Rendering", "rendering engine")}}.

Typically, this is a screen—but it may also be a printer, Braille display, or another type of device.

CSS offers several features that allow you to tweak your document's styles—or even offer different styles—according to the media **type** (such as screen or print, to name two) or media **capabilities** (such as width, resolution, or other values) of the viewer's device.

# Media query

A **media query** is a logical expression that is a method for CSS, JavaScript, HTML, and other web languages, to check aspects of the user agent or device that the document is being displayed in, independent of the document contents, to determine whether the associated code block or feature should be applied.

Media queries are used to conditionally apply CSS styles with the CSS {{cssxref("@media")}} and {{cssxref("@import")}} at-rules and in JavaScript to test and monitor media states such as with the {{DOMxRef("Window.matchMedia", "matchMedia()")}} method, {{DOMxRef("MediaQueryList.matches", "matches")}} property, and {{DOMxRef("MediaQueryList.change_event", "change")}} event. Media queries are used as values of the [`<link>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/link#media), [`<source>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/source#media), and [`<style>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/style#media) [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element `media` attributes, conditionally applying the link, source, or style if the media query is true. When a `media` attribute is omitted, it defaults to `true`. Media queries are also used as the value of the [`sizes`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/sizes) attribute of the {{HTMLElement("img")}} element.

Media queries are made up of optional media query modifiers and media types, and zero or more media conditions, along with logical operators.

Media queries are re-evaluated in response to changes in the user environment, such as when a user expands a browser window or flips a mobile device onto its side changing from portrait to landscape orientation.

Multiple comma-separated media queries create a **media query list**. A media query list is true if any of its component media queries are true, and false only if all of its component media queries are false.

A media query may optionally be prefixed by a single media query modifier or `not` or `only`, which in the case of `not`, alters the meaning of the following media query.

# Metadata

**Metadata** is — in its very simplest definition — data that describes data. For example, an {{glossary("HTML")}} document is data, but HTML can also contain metadata in its {{htmlelement("head")}} element that describes the document — for example who wrote it, and its summary.

# Method

A **method** is a {{glossary("function")}} which is a {{glossary("property")}} of an {{glossary("object")}}. There are two kinds of methods: _instance methods_ which are built-in tasks performed by an object instance, or _{{Glossary("static method", "static methods")}}_ which are tasks that are called directly on an object constructor.

> [!NOTE]
> In JavaScript functions themselves are objects, so, in that context, a method is actually an {{glossary("object reference")}} to a function.

When `F` is said to be a _method_ of `O`, it often means that `F` uses `O` as its [`this`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) binding. Function properties that do not have different behaviors based on their `this` value (or those that don't have a dynamic `this` binding at all — like [bound functions](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind) and [arrow functions](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)) may not be universally recognized as methods.

# Microsoft Edge

**Edge** is a proprietary, cross-platform {{Glossary("Browser","web browser")}} developed by Microsoft in 2014. Initially known as "Spartan", Edge replaced {{glossary("Microsoft Internet Explorer", "Internet Explorer")}}, which had been Microsoft's primary browser for over 20 years.

Edge is included with Windows 10 and Windows 11, and is also available for macOS, iOS/iPadOS, Android and Linux.

Edge used EdgeHTML as its {{Glossary("Engine/Rendering", "rendering engine")}} until 2019, when it was replaced by {{glossary("Blink")}}, the rendering engine used by {{Glossary("Google Chrome")}}. On iOS/iPadOS, Edge uses {{glossary("WebKit")}} as its rendering engine. Edge supports 'IE mode' for backwards compatibility that uses the {{glossary("Trident")}} engine to render pages requiring legacy Internet Explorer features.

# Microsoft Internet Explorer

**Internet Explorer** (or IE) was a free, graphical {{Glossary("Browser","web browser")}} maintained by Microsoft for legacy enterprise uses. {{glossary("Microsoft Edge")}} is currently the default Windows browser.

Microsoft first bundled IE with Windows in 1995 as part of the package called "Microsoft Plus!". By around 2002, Internet Explorer had become the most used browser in the world, but lost ground to {{glossary("Google Chrome", "Chrome")}}, {{glossary("Mozilla Firefox", "Firefox")}}, {{glossary("Microsoft Edge", "Edge")}}, and {{glossary("Apple Safari", "Safari")}}.

IE went through many releases and provided versions for desktop, mobile, and Xbox Console. It was also available on Mac and UNIX; Microsoft discontinued those versions in 2003 and 2001, respectively. The final Windows release was version 11.0.220 on November 10, 2020.

Microsoft ended support for IE on June 15, 2022.

# Middleware

Middleware is a (loosely defined) term for any software or service that enables the parts of a system to communicate and manage data. It is the software that handles communication between components and input/output, so developers can focus on the specific purpose of their application.

In server-side web application frameworks, the term is often more specifically used to refer to pre-built software components that can be added to the framework's request/response processing pipeline, to handle tasks such as database access.

# MIME

**MIME** (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is a standard to describe documents in other forms besides ASCII text, for example, audio, video, and images.
Initially used for email attachments, it has become the de facto standard to define types of documents anywhere.

  - {{Glossary("MIME Type")}}
# MIME type

A **MIME type** (now properly called "media type", but also sometimes "content type") is a string sent along with a file indicating the type of the file (describing the content format, for example, a sound file might be labeled `audio/ogg`, or an image file `image/png`).

It serves the same purpose as filename extensions traditionally do on Windows.
The name originates from the {{glossary("mime","MIME")}} standard originally used in email.

# Minification

**Minification** is the process of removing unnecessary or redundant data without affecting how a resource is processed by the browser.

Minification can include the removal of code comments, white space, and unused code, as well as the shortening of variable and function names. Minification is used to improve web performance by reducing file size. It is generally an automated step that occurs at build time.

As minification makes code less legible to humans, developer tools have 'prettification' features that can add white space back into the code to make it a bit more legible.
# MitM

A **manipulator-in-the-middle attack** (MitM) intercepts a communication between two systems. For example, a Wi-Fi router can be compromised.

Comparing this to physical mail: If you're writing letters to each other, the mail carrier can intercept each letter you mail. They open it, read it, eventually modify it, and then repackage the letter and only then send it to whom you intended to sent the letter for. The original recipient would then mail you a letter back, and the mail carrier would again open the letter, read it, eventually modify it, repackage it, and give it to you. You wouldn't know there's a manipulator in the middle in your communication channel – the mail carrier is invisible to you and to your recipient.

In physical mail and in online communication, MITM attacks are tough to defend. A few tips:

- Don't just ignore certificate warnings. You could be connecting to a phishing server or an imposter server.
- Sensitive sites without HTTPS encryption on public Wi-Fi networks aren't trustworthy.
- Check for HTTPS in your address bar and ensure encryption is in-place before logging in.

# Mixin

A _mixin_ is a {{Glossary("class")}} (interface, in WebAPI spec terms) in which some or all of its {{Glossary("method", "methods")}} and/or {{Glossary("property", "properties")}} are unimplemented, requiring that another {{Glossary("class")}} or {{Glossary("interface")}} provide the missing implementations.

The new class or interface then includes both the properties and methods from the mixin as well as those it defines itself. All of the methods and properties are used exactly the same regardless of whether they're implemented in the mixin or the interface or class that implements the mixin.

The advantage of mixins is that they can be used to simplify the design of APIs in which multiple interfaces need to include the same methods and properties.

For example, the `WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope` mixin is used to provide methods and properties that need to be available on both the {{domxref("Window")}} and {{domxref("WorkerGlobalScope")}} interfaces. The mixin is implemented by both of those interfaces.

# Mobile first

**Mobile first**, a form of {{Glossary("progressive enhancement")}}, is a web-development and web-design approach that focuses on prioritizing design and development for mobile screen sizes over design and development for desktop screen sizes. The rationale behind the mobile-first approach is to provide users with good user experiences at all screen sizes—by starting with creating a user experience that works well on small screens, and then building on top of that to further enrich the user experience as the screen size increases. The mobile-first approach contrasts with the older approach of designing for desktop screen sizes first, and then only later adding some support for small screen sizes.
# Modem

A modem ("**modulator-demodulator**") is a device that converts digital information to analog signals and vice versa, for sending data through networks.

Different kinds are used for different networks: DSL modems for telephone wires, Wi-Fi modems for short-range wireless radio signals, 3G modems for cellular data towers, and so on.

Modems are different from {{Glossary("Router","routers")}}, but many companies sell modems combined with routers.

# Multi-factor authentication

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is an authentication method in which the user has to present more than one type of evidence to a system in order to be authenticated.

Most commonly, three different types of evidence (or _factors_) are distinguished:

- Something you know, such as a password or PIN
- Something you have, such as a cellphone or a hardware security token
- Something you are: a biometric such as a fingerprint

If an authentication system requires the user to provide more than one of these factors in order to authenticate, then it is a multi-factor system.

For example, the system might ask the user for a password as well as a code generated by the authenticator app on their phone.
# Mutable

A **mutable** value is one that can be changed without creating an entirely new value, in comparison with {{Glossary("immutable", "immutable values")}}.

In {{glossary("JavaScript")}}, {{Glossary("Object","objects")}} and {{Glossary("Array","arrays")}} are mutable by default — their properties and elements can be changed without creating a new object or array.
By contrast, {{Glossary("primitive", "primitive values")}} are immutable — once a primitive value is created, it cannot be changed, although the variable that holds it may be reassigned another value.

# MVC

**MVC** (Model-View-Controller) is a pattern in software design commonly used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic. It emphasizes a separation between the software's business logic and display. This "separation of concerns" provides for a better division of labor and improved maintenance. Some other design patterns are based on MVC, such as MVVM (Model-View-Viewmodel), MVP (Model-View-Presenter), and MVW (Model-View-Whatever).

The three parts of the MVC software-design pattern can be described as follows:

1. Model: Manages data and business logic.
2. View: Handles layout and display.
3. Controller: Routes commands to the model and view parts.

## Model View Controller example

Imagine a simple shopping list app. All we want is a list of the name, quantity and price of each item we need to buy this week. Below we'll describe how we could implement some of this functionality using MVC.

![Diagram to show the different parts of the mvc architecture.](model-view-controller-light-blue.png)

### The Model

The model defines what data the app should contain. If the state of this data changes, then the model will usually notify the view (so the display can change as needed) and sometimes the controller (if different logic is needed to control the updated view).

Going back to our shopping list app, the model would specify what data the list items should contain — item, price, etc. — and what list items are already present.

### The View

The view defines how the app's data should be displayed.

In our shopping list app, the view would define how the list is presented to the user, and receive the data to display from the model.

### The Controller

The controller contains logic that updates the model and/or view in response to input from the users of the app.

So for example, our shopping list could have input forms and buttons that allow us to add or delete items. These actions require the model to be updated, so the input is sent to the controller, which then manipulates the model as appropriate, which then sends updated data to the view.

You might however also want to just update the view to display the data in a different format, e.g., change the item order to alphabetical, or lowest to highest price. In this case the controller could handle this directly without needing to update the model.

## MVC on the web

As a web developer, this pattern will probably be quite familiar even if you've never consciously used it before. Your data model is probably contained in some kind of database (be it a traditional server-side database like MySQL, or a client-side solution such as [IndexedDB \[en-US\]](/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API).) Your app's controlling code is probably written in HTML/JavaScript, and your user interface is probably written using HTML/CSS/whatever else you like. This sounds very much like MVC, but MVC makes these components follow a more rigid pattern.

In the early days of the Web, MVC architecture was mostly implemented on the server-side, with the client requesting updates via forms or links, and receiving updated views back to display in the browser. However, these days, more of the logic is pushed to the client with the advent of client-side data stores, and the [Fetch API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) enabling partial page updates as required.

Web frameworks such as [AngularJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS) and [Ember.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ember.js) all implement an MVC architecture, albeit in slightly different ways.

# Namespace

Namespace is a context for identifiers, a logical grouping of names used in a program. Within the same context and same scope, an identifier must uniquely identify an entity.

In an operating system, a directory is a namespace. Each file or subdirectory within a directory has a unique name; the same name can be used multiple times across subdirectories.

In HTML, CSS, and XML-based languages, a namespace is the explicitly declared or implied dialect to which an element (or attribute) belongs.

# NaN

NaN (Not a Number) is a numeric {{Glossary("Type", "data type")}} that means an undefined value or value that cannot be represented, especially results of floating-point calculations.

For example, NaNs can represent infinity, result of division by zero, missing value, or the square root of a negative (which is imaginary, whereas a floating-point number is real).

Practically speaking, if I divide two variables in a {{glossary("JavaScript")}} program, the result may be NaN, which is predefined in JavaScript as "undefined". Hence this division may break the program. Now, if this computation was a small part of a much larger algorithm, it would be really painful to figure out where the error actually occurs. Fortunately, since the result will be NaN and I know my divisor may turn out to be 0, I can set up testing conditions that prevent any such computations in the first place or notify me of where they happen.

# Native

A _native_ application has been compiled to run on the hardware/software environment that comprises the targeted architecture.

An example of a native Android app would be a mobile application written in Java using the Android toolchain.

On the other hand, a Web App that runs inside a browser is not native — it is run in the web browser, which sits on top of the native environment, not the native environment itself.

# Netscape Navigator

Netscape Navigator or Netscape was a leading {{glossary("browser")}} in the 1990s. Netscape was based on Mosaic and the Netscape team was led by Marc Andreessen, a programmer who also wrote code for Mosaic.

Netscape helped make the {{glossary("World Wide Web","Web")}} graphical rather than a text-only experience. Many browsing features became standard after Netscape introduced them. Netscape could display a webpage while loading, used JavaScript for forms and interactive content, and stored session information in cookies. Despite Netscape's technical advantages and initial dominance, by the late 1990s {{glossary("Microsoft Internet Explorer", "Internet Explorer")}} swiftly overtook Netscape in market share.

# Network throttling

**Network throttling** is an intentional slowing down of internet speed. In web performance, network throttling, or network condition emulation, it is used to emulate low bandwidth conditions experienced by likely a large segment of a site's target user base.

It's important not to overlook network conditions users experience on mobile. The internet speeds for developers creating web applications in a corporate office building on a powerful computer are generally very fast. As a developer, tech writer, or designer, this is likely your experience. The network speeds of a mobile user accessing that web application, possibly while traveling or in a remote area with poor data plan coverage, will likely be very slow, if they are able to get online at all. Network throttling enables a developer to emulate an experience of a user. Most browser developer tools, such as the browser inspector, provide a function to emulate different network conditions. By emulating your user's experience via network throttling, you can more readily identify and fix load time issues.

Browser developer tools generally have network throttling options, to allow you to test your app under slow network conditions. Firefox's developer tools for example have a drop-down menu available in both the [Network Monitor](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/network_monitor/index.html) and [Responsive Design Mode](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/responsive_design_mode/index.html) containing network speed options (e.g., Wi-Fi, good 3G, 2G)

# Node.js

Node.js is a cross-platform {{Glossary("JavaScript")}} runtime environment that allows developers to build server-side and network applications with JavaScript.

## Node Package Manager (npm)

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is a package manager that is downloaded and bundled alongside Node.js. Its command-line (CLI) client `npm` can be used to download, configure and create packages for use in Node.js projects. Downloaded packages can be imported by [ES imports](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) and [CommonJS `require()`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS) without including the dependency directory `node_modules/` they are downloaded to, as Node.js [resolves](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#loading-from-node_modules-folders) packages without a relative or absolute path specified in their import.

Packages hosted on npm are downloaded from the registry at [https://registry.npmjs.org/](https://registry.npmjs.org/), but the CLI can be configured to use any compatible instance.

# Node

The term **node** can have several meanings depending on the context. It may refer to:

{{GlossaryDisambiguation}}

Another use of the word is when talking about {{Glossary("Node.js")}}
# Node (networking)

In networking, a **node** is a connection point in the network. In physical networks, a node is usually a device, like a computer or a router.

# Non-normative

Software {{Glossary("specification", "specifications")}} often contain information marked as **non-normative** or _informative_, which is provided to help readers understand the specification better, or to show an example or best practice. Non-normative parts of the specification are provided as guidelines, and are not considered part of the formal specification. Sections that contain the official part of the specification are often marked as {{Glossary("normative")}}.

## See also

# Normative

Normative is a word commonly used in software {{Glossary("specification", "specifications")}} to denote sections that are standardized and must be followed as a rule. Specifications might also contain sections that are marked as _{{Glossary("non-normative")}}_ or _informative_, which means those are provided there for the purpose of helping the reader understand the specifications better or to showcase an example or best practice, which need not be followed as a rule.

# Null

In computer science, a **`null`** value represents a reference that points, generally intentionally, to a nonexistent or invalid {{glossary("object")}} or address. The meaning of a null reference varies among language implementations.

In {{Glossary("JavaScript")}}, `null` is marked as one of the {{Glossary("Primitive", "primitive values")}}, because its behavior is seemingly primitive. However, when using the [`typeof`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof) operator, it returns `"object"`.

```js
console.log(typeof null); // "object"
```

This is considered [a bug](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof#typeof_null), but one which cannot be fixed because it will break too many scripts.

# Nullish value

In {{Glossary("JavaScript")}}, a nullish value is the value which is either [`null`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/null) or {{JSxRef("undefined")}}. Nullish values are always {{Glossary("falsy")}}.
# Number

In {{Glossary("JavaScript")}}, **Number** is a numeric data type in the [double-precision 64-bit floating point format (IEEE 754)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_precision_floating-point_format). In other programming languages different numeric types exist; for example, Integers, Floats, Doubles, or Bignums.

# Object

In JavaScript, objects can be seen as a collection of properties. With the [object literal syntax](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#object_literals), a limited set of properties are initialized; then properties can be added and removed. Property values can be values of any type, including other objects, which enables building complex data structures. Properties are identified using _key_ values. A _key_ value is either a {{Glossary("String", "String value")}} or a [Symbol value](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol).

There are two types of object properties: The [_data_ property](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Data_structures#data_property) and the [_accessor_ property](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Data_structures#accessor_property).

> [!NOTE]
> It's important to recognize it's accessor _property_ — not accessor _method_. We can give a JavaScript object class-_like_ accessors by using a function as a value — but that doesn't make the object a class.

# Object reference

An **object reference** is a link to an _{{glossary("object")}}_. Object references can be used exactly like the linked objects.

The concept of object references becomes clear when assigning the same object to more than one _{{Glossary("property/javascript", "property")}}_. Rather than holding a copy of the object, each assigned property holds object references that link to the same object so that when the object changes, all properties referring to the object reflect the change.

# OOP

**OOP** (Object-Oriented Programming) is an approach in programming in which data is encapsulated within **{{glossary("object","objects")}}** and the object itself is operated on, rather than its component parts.

{{glossary("JavaScript")}} is heavily object-oriented. It follows a [**prototype**-based model](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain), but it also offers a [class syntax](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_classes) to enable typical OOP paradigms.

# Operator

Reserved **syntax** consisting of punctuation or alphanumeric characters that carries out built-in functionality. For example, in JavaScript the addition operator ("+") adds numbers together and concatenates strings, whereas the "not" operator ("!") negates an expression — for example making a `true` statement return `false`.

# Origin

Web content's **origin** is defined by the _scheme_ (protocol), _hostname_ (domain), and _port_ of the {{Glossary("URL")}} used to access it. Two objects have the same origin only when the scheme, hostname, and port all match.

Some operations are restricted to same-origin content, and this restriction can be lifted using {{Glossary("CORS")}}.

## Opaque origin

An opaque origin is a special type of browser-internal value that obscures the true origin of a resource (opaque origins are always serialized as `null`). They are used by the browser to ensure resource isolation as they are never considered equal to any other origin — including other opaque origins.

Opaque origins are applied in cases where the true origin of a resource is sensitive, cannot be safely used for security checks, or does not exist.
A resource with an opaque origin will have its {{httpheader("Origin")}} HTTP header in requests set to [`null`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Origin#null).
It will also fail same-origin checks with any other resource, and hence be restricted to only those operations available to cross-origin resources.

Common cases where opaque origins are used include:

- A document within an iframe that has the [sandbox](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/sandbox) attribute set, and does not include the `allow-same-origin` flag.
- `file:` URLs are usually treated as opaque origins so that files on they file system cannot read each other.
- Documents created programatically using APIs like {{domxref("DOMImplementation.createDocument()")}}.

## Examples

These are same origin because they have the same scheme (`http`) and hostname (`example.com`), and the different file path does not matter:

- `http://example.com/app1/index.html`
- `http://example.com/app2/index.html`

These are same origin because a server delivers HTTP content through port 80 by default:

- `http://example.com:80`
- `http://example.com`

These are not same origin because they use different schemes:

- `http://example.com/app1`
- `https://example.com/app2`

These are not same origin because they use different hostnames:

- `http://example.com`
- `http://www.example.com`
- `http://myapp.example.com`

These are not same origin because they use different ports:

- `http://example.com`
- `http://example.com:8080`

# PAC

A Proxy Auto-Configuration file (**PAC file**) is a file which contains a function, `FindProxyForURL()`, which is used by the browser to determine whether requests (including HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP) should go directly to the destination or if they need to be forwarded through a web proxy server.

```js
function FindProxyForURL(url, host) {
  // …
}

ret = FindProxyForURL(url, host);
```

See [Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) file](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Proxy_servers_and_tunneling/Proxy_Auto-Configuration_PAC_file) for details about how these are used and how to create new ones.

# Packet

A packet, or network packet, is a formatted chunk of data sent over a network. The main components of a network packet are the user data and control information. The user data is known as the _payload_. The control information is the information for delivering the payload. It consists of network addresses for the source and destination, sequencing information, and error detection codes and is generally found in packet headers and footer.

## What a packet contains

### Hop limit

A hop occurs when a packet is passed from one network to the next network. It is a field that decreases by one each time a packet goes through; once the hop limit reaches 0, the send operation has failed and the packet is discarded.

Over time the number packets can cause traversing within closed circuits, the number of packets circulating would build up and then ultimately lead to the networking in failing.

### Error detection and correction

Error detection and correction are codes that are used to detect and apply corrections to the errors that occur when data is transmitted to the receiver. There are two types of error corrections backward and forward error correction. Backward error correction is when the receiver requests the sender to retransmit the entire data unit. Forward error correction is when the receiver uses the error-correcting code which automatically corrects the errors

At the transmitter, the calculation is performed before the packet is sent. When received at the destination, the checksum is recalculated, and compared with the one in the packet.

### Priority

This field indicates which packet should have higher priority over the others. The high priority queue is emptied more quickly than lower priority queues when the network is congested.

### Addresses

When routing network packets it requires two network addresses the source address of the sending host, and the destination address of the receiving host.

### User Data - Payload

Payload is the data that is carried on behalf of an application. It is usually of variable length, up to a maximum that is set by the network protocol and sometimes the equipment on the route.

# Page load time

**Page load time** is the time it takes for a page to load, measured from [navigation start](/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceTiming/navigationStart) to the [start of the load event](/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceTiming/loadEventStart).

```js
let time = performance.timing;

let pageloadTime = time.loadEventStart - time.navigationStart;
```

While page load time 'sounds' like the perfect web performance metric, it isn't. Load times can vary greatly between users depending on device capabilities, network conditions, and, to a lesser extent, distance from the server. The development environment, where page load time is measured, is likely an optimal experience, not reflective of your users' reality. In addition, web performance isn't just about when the load event happens. It's also about {{Glossary("perceived performance")}}, responsiveness, {{Glossary("jank")}} and jitter.

# Page prediction

**Page Prediction** is a browser feature or script which, when enabled, tells the browser to download resources the user is likely to visit before the user requests the content. Page prediction improves performance by enabling almost instant loading of predicted content. However, page prediction may also download content a user does not seek.

Some web applications include a prediction feature completing search text and address bar URLs based on browsing history and related searches. For example, as the user types in the address bar, the browser might send the current text in the address bar to the search engine before the user submits the request.

Although browser page prediction and prediction services enable faster page loads, they consume additional bandwidth. Also, pre-loaded websites and embedded content can set and read their cookies as if they were visited even if they weren't.

# Parameter

**Parameters** are named variables declared as part of a {{Glossary("function")}}. They are used to reference the {{Glossary("argument", "arguments")}} passed into the function.

For example:

```js
const argument1 = "Web";
const argument2 = "Development";
example(argument1, argument2); // passing two arguments

// This function takes two values
function example(parameter1, parameter2) {
  console.log(parameter1); // Output = "Web"
  console.log(parameter2); // Output = "Development"
}
```

There are two kinds of parameters:

- input parameters
  - : the most common kind; they pass values into functions. Depending on the programming language, input parameters can be passed in several ways (e.g., call-by-value, call-by-address, call-by-reference).
- output/return parameters
  - : primarily return multiple values from a function, but are not recommended since they cause confusion

### Parameters versus arguments

Note the difference between _parameters_ and _arguments_:

- Function parameters are the names listed in the function's definition.
- Function {{Glossary("argument","arguments")}} are the real values passed to the function.
- Parameters are initialized to the values of the arguments supplied.

# Parse

Parsing means analyzing and converting a program into an internal format that a runtime environment can actually run, for example the {{glossary("JavaScript")}} engine inside browsers.

The [browser parses HTML](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content) into a {{glossary('DOM')}} tree. HTML parsing involves [tokenization](/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMTokenList) and tree construction. HTML tokens include start and end tags, as well as attribute names and values. If the document is well-formed, parsing it is straightforward and faster. The parser parses tokenized input into the document, building up the document tree.

When the HTML parser finds non-blocking resources, such as an image, the browser will request those resources and continue parsing. Parsing can continue when a CSS file is encountered, but `<script>` tags—particularly those without an [`async`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) or `defer` attribute—blocks rendering, and pauses parsing of HTML.

When the browser encounters CSS styles, it parses the text into the CSS Object Model (or {{glossary('CSSOM')}}), a data structure it then uses for styling layouts and painting. The browser then creates a render tree from both these structures to be able to paint the content to the screen. JavaScript is also downloaded, parsed, and then executed.

JavaScript parsing is done during {{glossary("compile time")}} or whenever the {{glossary("parser")}} is invoked, such as during a call to a method.

# Parser

A **parser** is the module of a compiler or interpreter that {{glossary("parse","parses")}} a source code file.

More generally, it's a piece of software that parses text and transforms its content to another representation.

# Payload body

In HTTP messages, the **payload body** or **payload** was the resource representation transferred in a message body, stripped of any [transfer encoding](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Transfer-Encoding). With no transfer encoding, the _payload body_ and _message body_ are identical. Representation data could also be transferred in HTTP headers, but such data would not be considered a "payload".

Since {{RFC("9110")}}, the word **content** replaces the word **payload**. See [**HTTP content**](/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP_Content).

# Payload header

A **payload header** is an {{Glossary("HTTP_header", "HTTP header")}} that describes the payload information related to safe transport and reconstruction of the original resource {{Glossary("Representation header", "representation")}}, from one or more messages. This includes information like the length of the message payload, which part of the resource is carried in this payload (for a multi-part message), any encoding applied for transport, message integrity checks, etc.

Payload headers may be present in both HTTP request and response messages (i.e., in any message that is carrying payload data).

The payload headers include: {{HTTPHeader("Content-Length")}}, {{HTTPHeader("Content-Range")}}, {{HTTPHeader("Trailer")}}, and {{HTTPHeader("Transfer-Encoding")}}.

# Percent-encoding

**Percent-encoding** is a mechanism to encode 8-bit characters that have specific meaning in the context of {{Glossary("URL", "URLs")}}. It is sometimes called URL encoding. The encoding consists of substitution: A '%' followed by the hexadecimal representation of the ASCII value of the replace character.

Special characters needing encoding are: `':'`, `'/'`, `'?'`, `'#'`, `'['`, `']'`, `'@'`, `'!'`, `'$'`, `'&'`, `"'"`, `'('`, `')'`, `'*'`, `'+'`, `','`, `';'`, `'='`, as well as `'%'` itself. Other characters don't need to be encoded, though they could.

| Character | Encoding     |
| --------- | ------------ |
| `':'`     | `%3A`        |
| `'/'`     | `%2F`        |
| `'?'`     | `%3F`        |
| `'#'`     | `%23`        |
| `'['`     | `%5B`        |
| `']'`     | `%5D`        |
| `'@'`     | `%40`        |
| `'!'`     | `%21`        |
| `'$'`     | `%24`        |
| `'&'`     | `%26`        |
| `"'"`     | `%27`        |
| `'('`     | `%28`        |
| `')'`     | `%29`        |
| `'*'`     | `%2A`        |
| `'+'`     | `%2B`        |
| `','`     | `%2C`        |
| `';'`     | `%3B`        |
| `'='`     | `%3D`        |
| `'%'`     | `%25`        |
| `' '`     | `%20` or `+` |

Depending on the context, the character `' '` is translated to a `'+'` (like in the percent-encoding version used in an `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` message), or in `'%20'` like on URLs.

# Physical properties

CSS **physical properties** define positions based on physical directions or element sides. For example:

- The {{Glossary("inset properties")}} {{cssxref("top")}}, {{cssxref("right")}}, {{cssxref("bottom")}}, and {{cssxref("left")}} refer to the physical dimensions of the viewport.
- Features such as {{cssxref("margin-top")}}, {{cssxref("border-right")}}, {{cssxref("padding-bottom")}}, and {{cssxref("border-bottom-left-radius")}} reference specific sides of an element, and style features by that physical direction.

This is opposed to {{glossary("logical properties")}}, which are relative to the content flow and use directional keywords relative to the block and inline axes.

- _Alice_ and _Bob_, two parties who want to send messages to each other, occasionally joined by _Carol_, a third participant
- _Eve_, a passive attacker who is eavesdropping on Alice and Bob's conversation
- _Mallory_, an active attacker ("man-in-the-middle") who is able to modify their conversation and replay old messages
# Plaintext

Plaintext refers to information that is being used as an input to an {{Glossary("encryption")}} {{Glossary("algorithm")}}, or to {{Glossary("ciphertext")}} that has been decrypted.

It is frequently used interchangeably with the term _cleartext_, which more loosely refers to any information, such as a text document, image, etc., that has not been encrypted and can be read by a human or computer without additional processing.
# Plugin

A browser plugin is a software component that users can install to handle content that the browser can't support natively. Browser plugins are usually written using the [NPAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPAPI) (Netscape Plugin Application Programming Interface) architecture.

The most well-known and widely used plugin was the now outdated Adobe Flash player, which enabled browsers to run {{Glossary("Adobe Flash")}} content.

As browsers have become more powerful, plugins have become less useful. Plugins also have a history of causing security and performance problems for web users.

Between 2016 and 2021 browser vendors worked on a deprecation roadmap for plugins and in particular for Adobe Flash, and today plugins are no longer supported by any major browsers.

Plugins should not be confused with browser extensions, which unlike plugins are distributed as source code rather than binaries, and which are still supported by browsers, notably using the {{Glossary("WebExtensions")}} system.

# Polyfill

A polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript on the Web) used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.

For example, a polyfill could be used to mimic the functionality of a {{cssxref("text-shadow")}} in IE7 using proprietary IE filters, or mimic rem units or media queries by using JavaScript to dynamically adjust the styling as appropriate, or whatever else you require.

The reason why polyfills are not used exclusively is for better functionality and better performance. Native implementations of APIs can do more and are faster than polyfills. For example, the [Object.create polyfill](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create#see_also) only contains the functionalities that are possible in a non-native implementation of Object.create.

Other times, polyfills are used to address issues where browsers implement the same features in different ways. The polyfill uses non-standard features in a certain browser to give JavaScript a standards-compliant way to access the feature. Although this reason for polyfilling is very rare today, it was especially prevalent back in the days of IE6 and Netscape where each browser implemented JavaScript very differently. The [1st version of jQuery](https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.4/jquery.js) was an early example of a polyfill. It was essentially a compilation of browser-specific workarounds to provide JavaScript developers with a single common API that worked in all browsers. At the time, JavaScript developers were having major problems trying to get their website to work across all devices because there was such a discrepancy between browsers that the website might have to be programmed radically differently and have a much different user interface based upon the user's browser. Thus, the JavaScript developer had access to only a very tiny handful of JavaScript APIs that worked more-or-less consistently across all browsers. Using a polyfill to handle browser-specific implementations is less common today because modern browsers mostly implement a broad set of APIs according to standard semantics.

# Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the presentation of one interface for multiple data types.

For example, integers, floats, and doubles are implicitly polymorphic: regardless of their different types, they can all be added, subtracted, multiplied, and so on.

In the case of {{glossary("OOP")}}, by making the {{glossary("class")}} responsible for its code as well as its own data, polymorphism can be achieved in that each class has its own {{glossary("function")}} that (once called) behaves properly for any {{glossary("object")}}.

# POP3

**POP3** (Post Office Protocol) is a very common {{glossary("protocol")}} for getting emails from a mail server over a {{glossary("TCP")}} connection. POP3 does not support folders, unlike the more recent {{Glossary("IMAP")}}, which is harder to implement because of its more complex structure.

Clients usually retrieve all messages and then delete them from the server, but POP3 does allow retaining a copy on the server. Nearly all email servers and clients currently support POP3.

# Port

For a computer connected to a network with an {{Glossary("IP address")}}, a **port** is a communication endpoint. Ports are designated by numbers, and below 1024 each port is associated by default with a specific {{Glossary("protocol")}}.

For example, the default port for the {{Glossary("HTTP")}} protocol is 80 and the default port for the HTTPS protocol is 443, so a {{Glossary("HTTP")}} server waits for requests on those ports. Each Internet protocol is associated with a default port: {{Glossary("SMTP")}} (25), {{Glossary("POP")}} (110), {{Glossary("IMAP")}} (143), {{Glossary("IRC")}} (194), and so on.

# Prefetch

Prefetching refers to the practice of speculatively fetching documents or subresources in the background for pages that the user is _likely_ to navigate to in the near future.
This can significantly reduce the load time for the prefetched page if the user does choose to navigate to it.
Prefetching might be used, for example, to fetch the page linked by a "Next" button or its subresources, or a link popup that a user hovers over, or search results.

### Resource prefetching

Resources should be prefetched based on how likely it is that they will be needed in a future navigation. Browsers can infer this automatically for some resources, such as the current URL in the address bar.

This can be done using [`<link rel="prefetch">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel/prefetch) (the [Speculation Rules API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API) only handles document prefetches for navigations):

```html
<link rel="prefetch" href="next.html" />
```

### Document prefetching

Developers can provide hints to the browser of navigations that should be prefetched in a couple of different ways:

[`<link rel="prefetch">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel/prefetch):

```html
<link rel="prefetch" href="next.html" />
```

[Speculation Rules API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API) prefetch:

```html
<script type="speculationrules">
  {
    "prefetch": [
      {
        "source": "list",
        "urls": ["next.html"]
      }
    ]
  }
</script>
```

The Speculation Rules API handles document prefetches for navigations much better than `<link rel="prefetch">`; the former was designed specifically for that purpose whereas the latter has a number of limitations; see [`<link rel="prefetch">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel/prefetch) for details.

### DNS prefetching

[DNS prefetching](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel/dns-prefetch) resolves domain names in advance, speeding up load times by reducing the time associated with domain lookup at request time.

```html
<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://example.com/" />
```

# Preflight request

A CORS preflight request is a {{Glossary("CORS")}} request that checks to see if the CORS protocol is understood and a server is aware using specific methods and headers.

It is an {{HTTPMethod("OPTIONS")}} request, using two or three HTTP request headers: {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Request-Method")}}, {{HTTPHeader("Origin")}}, and optionally {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Request-Headers")}}.

A preflight request is automatically issued by a browser and in normal cases, front-end developers don't need to craft such requests themselves. It appears when request is qualified as ["to be preflighted"](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS#preflighted_requests) and omitted for [simple requests](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS#simple_requests).

For example, a client might be asking a server if it would allow a {{HTTPMethod("DELETE")}} request, before sending a `DELETE` request, by using a preflight request:

```http
OPTIONS /resource/foo
Access-Control-Request-Method: DELETE
Access-Control-Request-Headers: x-requested-with
Origin: https://foo.bar.org
```

If the server allows it, then it will respond to the preflight request with an {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Methods")}} response header, which lists `DELETE`:

```http
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Connection: keep-alive
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://foo.bar.org
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS, DELETE
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: X-Requested-With
Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400
```

The preflight response can be optionally cached for the requests created in the same {{Glossary("URL")}} using {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Max-Age")}} header like in the above example. To cache preflight responses, the browser uses a specific cache that is separate from the general HTTP cache that the browser manages. Preflight responses are never cached in the browser's general HTTP cache.

# Prerender

Prerendering refers to the practice of speculatively {{Glossary("prefetch", "prefetching")}} and _rendering_ pages that the user is likely to navigate to in the near future (the browser renders the page in the background in what is effectively an invisible separate tab). Prerendering includes downloading a document's subresources and running associated JavaScript.

If the user then chooses to navigate to the page, display of its content can be near instant.

Prerendering might be used, for example, to fetch the page resources linked by a "Next" button, or a link popup that a user hovers over, or the likely page target of the URL being entered into the address bar. The following [speculation rules](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API) could be included in the head of a document to hint to the browser that it should prerender `next.html` and `next2.html`, as either might reasonably be a target of the next navigation:

```html
<script type="speculationrules">
  {
    "prerender": [
      {
        "source": "list",
        "urls": ["next.html", "next2.html"]
      }
    ]
  }
</script>
```

Prerendering results in faster display time than prefetching and hence a better user experience, at the cost of more resources being consumed.

# Primitive

In {{Glossary("JavaScript")}}, a **primitive** (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an {{Glossary("object")}} and has no {{glossary("method","methods")}} or {{Glossary("property/javascript", "properties")}}. There are 7 primitive data types:

- {{Glossary("string")}}
- {{Glossary("number")}}
- {{Glossary("bigint")}}
- {{Glossary("boolean")}}
- {{Glossary("undefined")}}
- [symbol](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol)
- {{Glossary("null")}}

Most of the time, a primitive value is represented directly at the lowest level of the language implementation.

All primitives are _immutable_; that is, they cannot be altered. It is important not to confuse a primitive itself with a variable assigned a primitive value. The variable may be reassigned to a new value, but the existing value can not be changed in the ways that objects, arrays, and functions can be altered. The language does not offer utilities to mutate primitive values.

Primitives have no methods but still behave as if they do. When properties are accessed on primitives, JavaScript _auto-boxes_ the value into a wrapper object and accesses the property on that object instead. For example, `"foo".includes("f")` implicitly creates a [`String`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) wrapper object and calls `String.prototype.includes()` on that object. This auto-boxing behavior is not observable in JavaScript code but is a good mental model of various behaviors — for example, why "mutating" primitives does not work (because `str.foo = 1` is not assigning to the property `foo` of `str` itself, but to an ephemeral wrapper object).

# Principle of least privilege

The principle of least privilege is a design consideration in computer security, according to which entities (including users, system processes, or programs) should be granted the minimum amount of access that they need in order to do their jobs.

For example, in a software development team, all members might need the ability to write to the source code repository, but only a subset of the team might need the ability to alter the repository's security settings.

Applying the principle of least privilege reduces the potential damage when an entity is compromised by an attacker: so for example, if a team member's account is compromised, then the damage that the attacker can do is limited by the privileges that were granted to that team member.
# Privileged code

**Privileged code** - JavaScript code of your extension. For example, code in content scripts.

**Non-privileged** - JavaScript on web-page.
# Privileged

Users are said to be **privileged** when they are granted additional rights to a system, or given ultimate access to content in a higher priority level when compared to normal users.

# Progressive enhancement

**Progressive enhancement** is a design philosophy that provides a baseline of essential content and functionality to as many users as possible, while delivering the best possible experience only to users of the most modern browsers that can run all the required code.

The word _progressive_ in _progressive enhancement_ means creating a design that achieves a simpler-but-still-usable experience for users of older browsers and devices with limited capabilities, while at the same time being a design that **progresses the user experience up** to a more-compelling, fully-featured experience for users of newer browsers and devices with richer capabilities.

[Feature detection](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Testing/Feature_detection) is generally used to determine whether browsers can handle more modern functionality, while {{Glossary("polyfill", "polyfills")}} are often used to add missing features with JavaScript.

Special notice should be taken of accessibility. Acceptable alternatives should be provided where possible.

Progressive enhancement is a useful technique that allows web developers to focus on developing the best possible websites while making those websites work on multiple unknown user agents. {{Glossary("Graceful degradation")}} is related but is not the same thing and is often seen as going in the opposite direction to progressive enhancement. In reality both approaches are valid and can often complement one another.

# Progressive web applications (PWAs)

**Progressive web applications** (**PWAs**) are applications that are built using web platform technologies, but that provide a user experience like that of a platform-specific app.

These kinds of apps enjoy all the best parts of the Web — such as discoverability via search engines, being linkable via {{Glossary("URL")}}s, and working across multiple form factors, but are progressively enhanced with modern APIs (such as [Service Workers](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) and [Push](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API)).

These features include being installable, working offline, and being easy to sync with and re-engage the user from the server.

# Promise

A **{{jsxref("Promise")}}** is an {{Glossary("object")}} that's returned by a {{Glossary("function")}} that has not yet completed its work. The promise literally represents a promise made by the function that it will eventually return a result through the promise object.

When the called function finishes its work {{Glossary("asynchronous", "asynchronously")}}, a function on the promise object called a resolution (or fulfillment, or completion) handler is called to let the original caller know that the task is complete.

# Property (CSS)

A **CSS property** is a characteristic (like color) whose associated value defines one aspect of how the browser should display the element.

Here's an example of a CSS rule:

```css
/* "div" is a selector indicating that all the div elements */
/* in the document will be styled by that rule */
div {
  /* The property "color" with the value "black" indicates */
  /* that the text will have the color black */
  color: black;

  /* The property "background-color" with the value "white" indicates */
  /* that the background color of the elements will be white */
  background-color: white;
}
```

# Property

The term **property** can have several meanings depending on the context. It may refer to:

{{GlossaryDisambiguation}}
# Property (JavaScript)

A **JavaScript property** is a member of an [object](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Data_structures#objects) that associates a key with a value. A JavaScript object is a data structure that stores a collection of properties.

A property consists of the following parts:

- A _name_ (also called a _key_), which is either a [string](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) or a [symbol](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol).
- A _value_, which can be any JavaScript value. A property that has a function as its value may also be called a {{Glossary("method")}}.
- Some _attributes_, which specify how the property can be read and written. A property may have the `configurable`, `enumerable`, and `writable` attributes.

[Accessor properties](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Data_structures#accessor_property) do not have an actual "value". The value is represented indirectly through a pair of functions, one (the getter) invoked when reading the value and one (the setter) invoked when setting the value. However, accessor properties behave like regular data properties on the surface, because the getter and setter functions are invoked automatically and are typically transparent to JavaScript code.

The property's value (including the getter and setter) and its attributes are stored in a data record called the _property descriptor_. Many methods, such as {{jsxref("Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor()")}} and {{jsxref("Object.defineProperty()")}}, work with property descriptors.

The term _property_ itself does not correspond to any JavaScript value — it's an abstract concept. For example, in the following code:

```js
const obj = {
  a: 1,
  b() {},
};
```

The object `obj` has two properties. The first one has `"a"` as the key and `1` as the value. The second one has `"b"` as the key and a function as the value (using the [method syntax](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Method_definitions)). The `"a"` – `1`, `"b"` – `function` associations are the properties of the object.

In the context of [classes](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes), properties can be divided into _instance properties_, which are owned by each instance, and _static properties_, which are owned by the class and hold data common to all instances. In the context of [inheritance](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain), properties can also be divided into _own properties_, which are owned by the object itself, and _inherited properties_, which are owned by objects in the prototype chain of the object.

For more information about reading and writing properties, see [working with objects](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_objects).

# Prototype-based programming

**Prototype-based programming** is a style of {{Glossary("OOP", "object-oriented programming")}} in which {{Glossary('Class', 'classes')}} are not explicitly defined, but rather derived by adding properties and methods to an instance of another class or, less frequently, adding them to an empty object.

In simple words: this type of style allows the creation of an {{Glossary('Object', 'object')}} without first defining its {{Glossary('Class', 'class')}}.

# Proxy server

A **proxy server** is an intermediate program or computer used when navigating through different networks of the Internet. They facilitate access to content on the World Wide Web. A proxy intercepts requests and serves back responses; it may forward the requests, or not (for example in the case of a cache), and it may modify it (for example changing its headers, at the boundary between two networks).

A proxy can be on the user's local computer, or anywhere between the user's computer and a destination server on the Internet. In general there are two main types of proxy servers:

- A **forward proxy** that handles requests from and to anywhere on the Internet.
- A **reverse proxy** taking requests from the Internet and forwarding them to servers in an internal network.

# Pseudo-class

In CSS, a **pseudo-class** selector targets elements depending on their state rather than on information from the document tree. For example, the selector {{cssxref(":visited", "a:visited")}} applies styles only to links that the user has already followed.

## See also

- [Pseudo-class documentation](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes)
# Pseudo-element

In CSS, a **pseudo-element** selector applies styles to parts of your document content in scenarios where there isn't a specific HTML element to select. For example, rather than putting the first letter of each paragraph in its own element, you can style them all with {{Cssxref("::first-letter", "p::first-letter")}}.

# Public-key cryptography

Public-key cryptography — or _asymmetric cryptography_ — is a cryptographic system in which keys come in pairs. The transformation performed by one of the keys can only be undone with the other key. One key (the _private key_) is kept secret while the other is made public.

## Digital signatures

When used for {{glossary("digital signature", "digital signatures")}}, the private key is used to sign, and the public key is used to verify. This means that anyone can verify a signature, but only the owner of the corresponding private key could have generated it.

## Encryption

When used for {{glossary("encryption")}}, the public key is used to encrypt, and the private key is used to decrypt. This gives public-key encryption systems an advantage over symmetric encryption systems: The encryption key can be made public. Anyone can encrypt a message to the owner of the private key, but only the owner of the private key can decrypt it.

However, public-key encryption systems are typically much slower than symmetric algorithms, and the size of the messages they can encrypt is proportional to the size of the key, so they do not scale well for long messages.

As a result, it's common for an encryption system to use a symmetric algorithm to encrypt the messages, then a public-key system to encrypt the symmetric key. This arrangement can confer the benefits of both systems.

## Common public-key cryptosystems

Commonly used public-key cryptosystems are [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_cryptosystem) (for both signing and encryption), [DSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm) (for signing) and [Diffie–Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange) (for key agreement).

Elliptic-curve cryptography offers an alternative approach to these cryptographic systems with the benefit of using comparatively smaller key sizes, faster operations, and smaller storage and transmission.
Popular elliptic-curve algorithms include [Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie–Hellman) and [Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm), which developers will often encounter abbreviated as **ECDH** and **ECDSA**.

# Python

**Python** is a high level general-purpose programming language. It uses a multi-paradigm approach, meaning it supports procedural, object-oriented, and some functional programming constructs.

It was created by Guido van Rossum as a successor to another language (called ABC) between 1985 and 1990, and is currently used on a large array of domains like web development, desktop applications, data science, DevOps, and automation/productivity.

Python is developed under an OSI-approved open source license, making it freely usable and distributable, even for commercial use. Python's license is administered by the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/).

# Quality values

**Quality values**, or _q-values_ and _q-factors_, are used to describe the order of priority of values in a comma-separated list. It is a special syntax allowed in some [HTTP headers](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers) and in HTML.

The importance of a value is marked by the suffix `';q='` immediately followed by a value between `0` and `1` included, with up to three decimal digits, the highest value denoting the highest priority. When not present, the default value is `1`.

## Examples

The following syntax

```http
text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
```

indicates the order of priority:

| Value                                   | Priority |
| --------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `text/html` and `application/xhtml+xml` | `1.0`    |
| `application/xml`                       | `0.9`    |
| `*/*`                                   | `0.8`    |

If there is no priority defined for the first two values, the order in the list is irrelevant. Nevertheless, with the same quality, more specific values have priority over less specific ones:

```http
text/html;q=0.8,text/*;q=0.8,*/*;q=0.8
```

| Value       | Priority                      |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| `text/html` | `0.8` (but totally specified) |
| `text/*`    | `0.8` (partially specified)   |
| `*/*`       | `0.8` (not specified)         |

Some syntax, like the one of {{HTTPHeader("Accept")}}, allow additional specifiers like `text/html;level=1`. These increase the specificity of the value. Their use is extremely rare.

# Quaternion

A **quaternion** is the quotient of two 3D vectors and is used in 3D graphics and in accelerometer-based sensors to represent orientation or rotational data.

While mathematical quaternions are more involved than this, the **unit quaternions** (or **rotational quaternions**) used to represent rotation while using {{Glossary("WebGL")}} or [WebXR](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API), for example, are represented using the same syntax as a 3D point. As such, the type {{domxref("DOMPoint")}} (or {{domxref("DOMPointReadOnly")}}) is used to store quaternions.

# QUIC

**QUIC** is a multiplexed transport protocol implemented on UDP. It is used instead of {{Glossary("TCP")}} as the transport layer in HTTP/3.

QUIC was designed to provide quicker setup and lower latency for HTTP connections. In particular:

- In TCP, the initial TCP handshake is optionally followed by a TLS handshake, which must complete before data can be transmitted. Since TLS is almost ubiquitous now, QUIC integrates the TLS handshake into the initial QUIC handshake, reducing the number of messages that must be exchanged during setup.

- HTTP/2 is a multiplexed protocol, allowing multiple simultaneous HTTP transactions. However, the transactions are multiplexed over a single TCP connection, meaning that packet loss and subsequent retransmissions at the TCP layer can block all transactions. QUIC avoids this by running over UDP and implementing packet loss detection and retransmission separately for each stream, meaning that packet loss only blocks the particular stream whose packets were lost.

# RAIL

**RAIL**, an acronym for **Response, Animation, Idle, and Load**, is a performance model originated by the Google Chrome team in 2015, focused on user experience and performance within the browser. The performance mantra of RAIL is "Focus on the user; the end goal isn't to make your site perform fast on any specific device, it's to make users happy." There are 4 stages of interaction: page load, idle, response to input, and scrolling and animation. In acronym order, the main tenets are:

- **Response**
  - : Respond to users immediately, acknowledging any user input in **100ms** or less.
- **Animation**
  - : When animating, render each frame in under **16ms**, aiming for consistency and avoiding jank.
- **Idle**
  - : When using the main JavaScript thread, work in chunks for less than **50ms** to free up the thread for user interactions.
- **Load**
  - : Deliver interactive content in less than **5 second**.

# Raster image

A **_raster image_** is an image file defined as a grid of pixels. They're also referred to as _bitmaps_. Common raster image formats on the Web are {{Glossary("JPEG")}}, {{Glossary("PNG")}}, {{Glossary("GIF")}}, and [ICO](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICO_(file_format)>).

Raster image files usually contain one set of dimensions, but the ICO and CUR formats, used for favicons and [CSS cursor images](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor), can contain multiple sizes.
# Rate limit

In computing, especially in networking, **rate limiting** means controlling how many operations can be performed in a given amount of time, usually to avoid overloading the system and causing performance degradation. For example, a server might limit the number of requests it will accept from a single client in a given time period, which not only optimizes the server's overall performance but also mitigates attacks like {{Glossary("Denial of Service", "DoS attack")}}.

Rate limiting is typically synonymous with {{glossary("throttle", "throttling")}}, although {{glossary("debounce", "debouncing")}} is another viable strategy which provides better semantics and user experience in certain cases.

# RDF

**RDF** (Resource Description Framework) is a language developed by W3C for representing information on the World Wide Web, such as Webpages. RDF provides a standard way of encoding resource information so that it can be exchanged in a fully automated way between applications.

# Reading order

**Reading order** refers to the order in which content is accessed, for example when read out by a {{glossary("screen reader")}}, or navigated to using sequential navigation methods such as tabbing through links or buttons. By default, the reading order of a webpage is defined by the document source order.

Generally, the source order should express a sensible reading order for the content, and this should also be reflected by the visual order of the content layout. However, sometimes the visual order goes out of sync with the source order. For example, you might apply different layouts to a document based on [media queries](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries) to suit various device or user requirements, or adjust tabbing order via [`tabindex`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/tabindex).

These updates can cause accessibility issues. For example, when a sighted screen reader user tabs through content, and the screen reader order differs from the visual order, this is bad user experience and can be inaccessible. The reading order should make sense to all users no matter how they access the content.

## Modifying reading order in CSS

An element's reading order can be modified via the {{cssxref("reading-flow")}} property, and tweaked further by setting {{cssxref("reading-order")}} values on child items of the element.

The following definitions are significant in understanding modified reading order:

- Reading flow container
  - : An element with a modified reading order resulting from the values set for its {{cssxref("reading-flow")}} and {{cssxref("reading-order")}} properties.
- Reading flow
  - : The modified reading order of a reading flow container's child elements.

# Real User Monitoring (RUM)

**Real User Monitoring** (**RUM**) measures the performance of a page from real users' machines. Generally, a third party script injects a script on each page to measure and report page load data for every request made. This technique monitors an application's actual user interactions. In RUM, the third party script collects performance metrics from the real users' browsers. RUM helps identify how an application is being used, including the geographic distribution of users and the impact of that distribution on the end user experience.

# Recursion

The act of a function calling itself, recursion is used to solve problems that contain smaller sub-problems. A recursive function can receive two inputs: a base case (ends recursion) or a recursive case (resumes recursion).

## Examples

### Recursive function calls itself until condition met

The following Python code defines a function that takes a number, prints it, and then calls itself again with the number's value -1. It keeps going until the number is equal to 0, in which case it stops.

```python
def recurse(x):
   if x > 0:
       print(x)
       recurse(x - 1)

recurse(10)
```

The output will look like this:

```plain
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
```

### Recursion is limited by stack size

The following code defines a function that returns the maximum size of the call stack available in the JavaScript runtime in which the code is run.

```js
const getMaxCallStackSize = (i) => {
  try {
    return getMaxCallStackSize(++i);
  } catch {
    return i;
  }
};

console.log(getMaxCallStackSize(0));
```

### Common usage examples

```js
const factorial = (n) => {
  if (n === 0) {
    return 1;
  }
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
};
console.log(factorial(10));
// 3628800
```

```js
const fibonacci = (n) => (n <= 2 ? 1 : fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2));
console.log(fibonacci(10));
// 55
```

```js
const reduce = (fn, acc, [cur, ...rest]) =>
  cur === undefined ? acc : reduce(fn, fn(acc, cur), rest);
console.log(reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]));
// 45
```

# Reflow

**Reflow** happens when a {{glossary("browser")}} recalculates the position and geometry of certain parts of a webpage, such as after an update on an interactive site. This tends to be followed by repainting, which is when the browser redraws the webpage to show the resulting visual updates.

# Regular expression

**Regular expressions** (or _regex_) are rules that govern which sequences of characters come up in a search.

Regular expressions are implemented in various languages, but the best-known implementation is the Perl Implementation, which has given rise to its own ecosystem of implementations called PCRE (_Perl Compatible Regular Expression_). On the Web, {{glossary("JavaScript")}} provides another regex implementation through the {{jsxref("RegExp")}} object.

# Relying party

A **relying party** (RP) is an entity that needs to control access to a resource and, to do so, needs to {{glossary("authentication", "authenticate")}} other entities that are trying to access that resource. On the web, a relying party is usually a website that allows users to sign in and needs to authenticate users (for example by checking a password) before deciding whether to grant them access.

The RP website _relies on_ the validity of the credentials the browser presents when it grants access to its resources. The authentication and credentials are often provided by a third-party {{glossary("Identity provider", "identity provider")}} (IdP).

# Render-blocking

**Render-blocking** refers to any part of the process of loading a website that blocks the rendering of the user interface. Render-blocking is bad for web performance because it increases the length of time until users can interact with the site — for example, viewing content or interacting with controls.

The most common causes of render-blocking are initially-loaded CSS or JavaScript files.

# Repaint

**Repaint** happens when a {{glossary("browser")}} redraws a web page to show the visual updates resulting from a UI change, such as after an update on an interactive site. This usually follows reflowing, which is when the browser recalculates the position and geometry of certain parts of a web page.

# Replaced elements

In web development, **replaced elements** are HTML elements whose content are replaced by external resources or content defined outside of the document structure, and are not considered in the CSS rendering model. They are external objects whose representation is independent of the CSS formatting model.

The following can be replaced elements:

- {{HTMLElement("img")}}
- {{HTMLElement("video")}}
- {{HTMLElement("iframe")}}
- {{HTMLElement("embed")}}
- {{HTMLElement("fencedframe")}}

The following are treated as replaced elements only in specific cases:

- {{HTMLElement("audio")}}
- {{HTMLElement("canvas")}}
- {{HTMLElement("object")}}
- {{HTMLElement("input")}} (`image` input types only)

Replaced elements often have an {{glossary("intrinsic size", "intrinsic dimensions")}} and {{glossary("aspect ratio", "intrinsic ratio")}}. For example, the content of an `<img>` element is generally replaced by the image defined by its `src` attribute. That image has an intrinsic width and an intrinsic height specified in absolute units, which determines the aspect ratio.

Form controls are generally non-replaced _widgets_, except for `<input type="image">`, which is replaced with an image. Objects inserted using the CSS {{cssxref("content")}} property are _anonymous replaced elements_. They are "anonymous" because they don't exist in the HTML markup.

# Replay attack

In web security, a _replay attack_ happens when an attacker intercepts a previously-sent message and resends it later to get the same credentials as the original message, potentially with a different payload or instruction.

Replay attacks can be prevented by including a unique, single-use identifier with each message that the receiver can use to verify the authenticity of the transmission. This identifier can take the form of a session token or "number used only once" ("nonce").

## See also

- [Replay attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack) on Wikipedia.
# Repo

In a revision control system like {{Glossary("Git")}} or {{Glossary("SVN")}}, a repo (i.e., "repository") is a place that hosts an application's code source, together with various metadata.

## See also

- [Repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repository_%28revision_control%29) on Wikipedia
# Reporting directive

**{{Glossary("CSP")}} reporting directives** are used in a {{HTTPHeader("Content-Security-Policy")}} header and control the reporting process of CSP violations.

See [Reporting directives](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy#reporting_directives) for a complete list.

# Representation header

A **representation header** (or 'representation metadata') is an {{glossary("HTTP_header", "HTTP header")}} that describes how to interpret the data contained in the message.

For example, the content in a particular message might be encoded for transport, the whole resource might be formatted as a particular media type such as XML, JSON, HTML or Markdown, localized to a particular written language or geographical region, and/or compressed using a particular algorithm.
The representation headers allow the underlying data to be extracted and understood.
The underlying resource is semantically the same in each case, but its representation is different.

While representations are different forms of resources, representations can themselves also be transmitted in various forms: an HTTP message frames (cf., e.g., HTTP/1.1's {{HTTPHeader("Transfer-Encoding")}}), a particular stream of octets (cf., e.g., {{HTTPHeader("Content-Range")}}) derived from the _selected representation_.

Clients specify the formats that they prefer to be sent during [Content Negotiation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Content_negotiation) (using `Accept-*` headers), and the representation headers tell the client the format of the _selected representation_ they received.

Representation headers may be present in both HTTP request and response messages with various methods.
If sent as a response to a `HEAD` request, they describe the body content representation that _would_ be selected if the resource was requested with a `GET` request.

Representation headers include:

- {{HTTPHeader("Content-Length")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Content-Range")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Content-Type")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Content-Encoding")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Content-Location")}}
- {{HTTPHeader("Content-Language")}}

- Validators used in [conditional requests](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Conditional_requests), such as:
  - {{HTTPHeader("Last-Modified")}}
  - {{HTTPHeader("ETag")}}

Representation headers are not mutually exclusive with {{Glossary("Content header", "content headers")}}.

- {{HTTPHeader("Content-Digest")}}, {{HTTPHeader("Want-Content-Digest")}}
# Request header

A **request header** is an {{glossary("HTTP header")}} that can be used in an HTTP request to provide information about the request context, so that the server can tailor the response. For example, the {{HTTPHeader("Accept", "Accept-*")}} headers indicate the allowed and preferred formats of the response. Other headers can be used to supply authentication credentials (e.g., {{HTTPHeader("Authorization")}}), to control caching, or to get information about the user agent or referrer, etc.

Not all headers that can appear in a request are referred to as _request headers_ by the specification. For example, the {{HTTPHeader("Content-Type")}} header is referred to as a {{glossary("representation header")}}.

In addition, {{Glossary("CORS")}} defines a subset of request headers as {{glossary('CORS-safelisted request header', 'simple headers')}}, request headers that are always considered authorized and are not explicitly listed in responses to {{glossary("preflight request", "preflight")}} requests.

The HTTP message below shows a few request headers after a {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} request:

```http

# Resource Timing

Diagnosing performance issues requires performance data at the granularity of the resource. The [Resource Timing API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API/Resource_timing) is a JavaScript API that is able to capture timing information for each individual resource that is fetched when a page is loaded.

## See also

- [Server Timing](https://w3c.github.io/server-timing/)
# Response header

A **response header** is an {{glossary("HTTP header")}} that can be used in an HTTP response and that doesn't relate to the content of the message. Response headers, like {{HTTPHeader("Age")}}, {{HTTPHeader("Location")}} or {{HTTPHeader("Server")}} are used to give a more detailed context of the response.

Not all headers appearing in a response are categorized as _response headers_ by the specification. For example, the {{HTTPHeader("Content-Type")}} header is a {{glossary("representation header")}} indicating the original type of data in the body of the response message (prior to the encoding in the {{HTTPHeader("Content-Encoding")}} representation header being applied). However, "conversationally" all headers are usually referred to as response headers in a response message.

The following shows a few response and representation headers after a {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} request.

```http

# REST

**REST** (Representational State Transfer) refers to a group of software architecture design constraints that bring about efficient, reliable and scalable distributed systems.

The basic idea of REST is that a resource, e.g., a document, is transferred via well-recognized, language-agnostic, and reliably standardized client/server interactions. Services are deemed RESTful when they adhere to these constraints.

HTTP APIs in general are sometimes colloquially referred to as RESTful APIs, RESTful services, or REST services, although they don't necessarily adhere to all REST constraints. Beginners can assume a REST API means an HTTP service that can be called using standard web libraries and tools.

# RGB

_Red-Green-Blue_ (**RGB**) is a color model that represents colors as mixtures of three underlying components (or channels), namely: _red_, _green_, and _blue_. This model describes a color with a sequence of three numbers (typically between 0.0 and 1.0, or between 0 and 255). Each number represents the primary colors' different intensities (or contributions) in determining the final color.

An RGB value by itself has no meaning. It's the color model that defines how the three components interact within a {{glossary("color space")}} to define a color. Graphically, a point in a three-dimensional grid or cube represents a color. Each dimension (or axis) corresponds to a different channel. The RGB color model is then a _cubic_, or _Cartesian_, coordinate system of the underlying color space.

![The RGB color model as a cube with red, blue, and green axes](rgb_color_cube.png)

For the web, the underlying color space for an RGB value is _sRGB_ (Standard RGB), and each RGB component is a number between 0 and 1.

Note that `sRGB` is one of [several RGB color spaces](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Color_space#rgb_color_spaces). Other RGB color spaces, like the _Adobe RGB_ color space, can represent a wider {{glossary("gamut")}} of color than the _sRGB_ color space. The coordinates in _sRGB_ and _Adobe RGB_ are different.

There are many ways to describe the RGB components of a color. In {{Glossary("CSS")}}, they can be represented in various ways: in [hexadecimal](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hex-color) notation as a single 24-bit integer (for example, `#add8e6` is light blue) or in functional notation by using [`rgb()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/rgb) with three percent values or numbers ranging from `0` to `255` (for example, `rgb(46 139 87)` is green). CSS also supports the `srgb`, `srgb-linear`, `a98-rgb`, and `prophoto-rgb` color spaces for the [`color()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/color) function.

RGB is not the only color model that can represent the `sRGB` {{glossary("color space")}}. Cylindrical coordinate systems like the [`HSL`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl) (_hue-saturation-lightness_) or [`HWB`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hwb) (_hue-whiteness-blackness_) color models are also used to represent an `sRGB` color on the web.

# Random Number Generator

A **PRNG** (pseudorandom number generator) is an algorithm that outputs numbers in a complex, seemingly unpredictable pattern. Truly random numbers (say, from a radioactive source) are utterly unpredictable, whereas all algorithms are predictable, and a PRNG returns the same numbers when passed the same starting parameters or _seed_.

PRNGs can be used for a variety of applications, such as games.

A cryptographically secure PRNG is a PRNG with certain extra properties making it suitable for use in cryptography. These include:

- that it's computationally unfeasible for an attacker (without knowledge of the seed) to predict its output
- that if an attacker can work out its current state, this should not enable the attacker to work out previously emitted numbers.

Most PRNGs are not cryptographically secure.

# Robots.txt

A **robots.txt** is a file that is usually placed in the root of a website (for example, `https://www.example.com/robots.txt`).
It specifies whether or not {{Glossary("crawler", "crawlers")}} are allowed access to an entire website, or to specified resources.
A restrictive `robots.txt` file can prevent bandwidth consumption by crawlers.

A site owner can forbid crawlers to detect a certain path (and all files in that path) or a specific file.
This is often done to prevent these resources from being indexed or served by search engines.

If a crawler is allowed to access resources, you can define [indexing rules](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/X-Robots-Tag#directives) for those resources via [`<meta name="robots">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/name/robots) elements (commonly referred to as a "robots tag") and {{HTTPHeader("X-Robots-Tag")}} HTTP headers.
Search-related crawlers use these rules to determine how to index and serve resources in search results, or to adjust the crawl rate for specific resources over time.

# Round Trip Time (RTT)

**Round Trip Time** (**RTT**) is the length time it takes for a data packet to be sent to a destination plus the time it takes for an acknowledgment of that packet to be received back at the origin. The RTT between a network and server can be determined by using the `ping` command.

```bash
ping example.com
```

This will output something like:

```plain
PING example.com (216.58.194.174): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 216.58.194.174: icmp_seq=0 ttl=55 time=25.050 ms

# Router

On the web, the term **router** can refer to different concepts depending on the context:

- For the network layer, a router is a networking device that decides where to direct {{Glossary('Packet', 'data packets')}}.
- For a {{Glossary("SPA", "single-page application (SPA)")}} in the application layer, a router is a library that decides what web page is presented by a given {{Glossary('URL')}}. This middleware module is used for all URL functions, as these are given a path to a file that is rendered to open the next page.

  The concept of routing in SPAs has evolved significantly over the years. See the {{Glossary("hash routing")}} glossary entry to learn more.

- In the implementation of an {{Glossary('API')}} in a service layer, a router is a software component that parses a request and directs or routes the request to various handlers within a program. The router code usually accepts a response from the handler and facilitates its return to the requester.

## See also

- For the network layer context, see [Router (computing)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)>) on Wikipedia.
- In the application layer context, most of the popular SPA frameworks include built-in routing libraries, such as:
  - [Angular router](https://angular.dev/guide/routing/common-router-tasks)
  - [React router](https://reactrouter.com/)
  - [Vue router](https://router.vuejs.org/)
# RSS

**RSS** (Really Simple Syndication) refers to several XML document formats designed for publishing site updates. When you subscribe to a website's RSS feed, the website sends information and updates to your RSS reader in an RSS document called a _feed_, so you don't need to check all your favorite websites manually.

# Rsync

[Rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/) is an open-source file synchronizing tool that provides incremental file transfer. It can be used over insecure and secure transports (like SSH). It is available on most Unix-based systems (such as macOS and Linux) and Windows. There are also GUI-based tools that use rsync, for example, [Acrosync](https://acrosync.com/mac.html).

A basic command looks like this:

```bash
rsync [-options] SOURCE user@x.x.x.x:DESTINATION
```

- `-options` is a dash followed by one or more letters, for example `-v` for verbose error messages, and `-b` to make backups. See the full list of options at the [rsync man page.](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync) (Search for "Options summary.")
- `SOURCE` is the path to the local file or directory that you want to copy or synchronize
- `user@` is the credentials of the user on the remote server you want to copy files over to.
- `x.x.x.x` is the IP address of the remote server.
- `DESTINATION` is the path to the location you want to copy your directory or files to on the remote server.

You can also make a connection over SSH using the `-e` option as shown:

```bash
rsync [-options] -e "ssh [SSH DETAILS GO HERE]" SOURCE user@x.x.x.x:DESTINATION
```

There are numerous examples on the Internet, including those at the [official website](https://rsync.samba.org/examples.html), and at the [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync#Examples) for rsync.
# RTCP (RTP Control Protocol)

The **RTP Control Protocol** (**RTCP**) is a partner to the {{Glossary("RTP")}} protocol. RTCP is used to provide control and statistical information about an RTP media streaming session.

This lets control and statistics packets be separated logically and functionally from the media streaming while using the underlying packet delivery layer to transmit the RTCP signals as well as the RTP and media contents.

RTCP periodically transmits control packets to all of an RTP session's participants, using the same mechanism that is being used to transmit the data packets. That underlying protocol handles the multiplexing of the data and control packets and may use separate network ports for each type of packet.

# RTF

RTF (Rich Text Format) is a plain-text-based file format with support for formatting instructions (like bold or italic).

Three programmers in the Microsoft Word team created RTF in the 1980s, and Microsoft continued to develop the format until 2008. However, many word-processing programs can still read and write RTF.

# RTL (Right to Left)

**RTL** (**Right To Left**) is a {{Glossary("locale")}} property indicating that text is written from right to left.

For example, the `he` locale (for Hebrew) specifies right-to-left. Arabic (`ar`) is another common language written RTL.

The opposite of RTL, LTR (Left To Right) is used in other languages, including English (`en`, `en-US`, `en-GB`, etc.), Spanish (`es`), and French (`fr`).

# RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) and SRTP (Secure RTP)

The **Real-time Transport Protocol** (**RTP**) is a network protocol which described how to transmit various media (audio, video) from one endpoint to another in a real-time fashion. RTP is suitable for video-streaming application, telephony over {{glossary("IP")}} like Skype and conference technologies.

The secure version of RTP, **SRTP**, is used by [WebRTC](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API), and uses encryption and authentication to minimize the risk of denial-of-service attacks and security breaches.

RTP is rarely used alone; instead, it is used in conjunction with other protocols like {{glossary("RTSP")}} and {{glossary("SDP")}}.

# RTSP: Real-time streaming protocol

Real-time streaming protocol (RTSP) is a network protocol that controls how the streaming of a media should occur between a {{glossary("server")}} and a client. Basically, RTSP is the protocol that describes what happens when you click "Pause"/"Play" when streaming a video. If your computer were a remote control and the streaming server a television, RTSP would describe how the instruction of the remote control affects the TV.

# Ruby

**Ruby** is an open-source programming language. In a {{glossary("world wide web","Web")}} context, Ruby is often used server-side with the _Ruby On Rails_ (ROR) framework to produce websites/apps.

Ruby is also a method for annotating east Asian text in HTML documents to provide pronunciation information; see the {{HTMLElement("ruby")}} element.

# Safe (HTTP Methods)

An HTTP method is **safe** if it doesn't alter the state of the server. In other words, a method is safe if it leads to a read-only operation. Several common HTTP methods are safe: {{HTTPMethod("GET")}}, {{HTTPMethod("HEAD")}}, or {{HTTPMethod("OPTIONS")}}. All safe methods are also {{glossary("idempotent")}}, but not all idempotent methods are safe. For example, {{HTTPMethod("PUT")}} and {{HTTPMethod("DELETE")}} are both idempotent but unsafe.

Even if safe methods have a read-only semantic, servers can alter their state: e.g., they can log or keep statistics. What is important here is that by calling a safe method, the client doesn't request any server change itself, and therefore won't create an unnecessary load or burden for the server. Browsers can call safe methods without fearing to cause any harm to the server; this allows them to perform activities like pre-fetching without risk. Web crawlers also rely on calling safe methods.

Safe methods don't need to serve static files only; a server can generate an answer to a safe method on-the-fly, as long as the generating script guarantees safety: it should not trigger external effects, like triggering an order in an e-commerce website.

It is the responsibility of the application on the server to implement the safe semantic correctly, the web server itself, being Apache, Nginx or IIS, can't enforce it by itself. In particular, an application should not allow {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} requests to alter its state.

A call to a safe method, not changing the state of the server:

```http
GET /pageX.html HTTP/1.1
```

A call to a non-safe method, that may change the state of the server:

```http
POST /pageX.html HTTP/1.1
```

A call to an idempotent but non-safe method:

```http
DELETE /idX/delete HTTP/1.1
```

# Safe

The term **safe** can have several meanings depending on the context. It may refer to:

{{GlossaryDisambiguation}}
# Salt

In cryptography, **salt** is random data added to a password before it is {{glossary("hash function", "hashed")}}. This makes it impossible for an attacker to derive passwords from their hashes using precomputed tables of passwords and the corresponding hashes.

Passwords should never be stored in their plaintext form, because of the risk that an attacker might break into the database where they are stored. Typically, the password is hashed, and the resulting hash is stored. If the hash function is cryptographically secure, then even if an attacker can get access to the stored hashes, it is impractical for them to reverse the function.

To derive a password from a hash, attackers can look up the password corresponding to a hash in a precomputed table (also known as a [rainbow table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table)) mapping possible passwords to their hashes:

| Password | Hash        |
| -------- | ----------- |
| pa55w0rd | 56965E2A... |
| abcdef   | BEF57EC7... |
| letmein  | 1C8BFE8F... |

Although these tables may be very large, such attacks can be effective because table lookup is a fast operation.

Adding random salt to passwords before hashing them stops this attack from working because the hash is not calculated based on the password alone but on the password combined with the salt.

Unlike the password, the salt does not need to be kept secret: it can be stored alongside the salted and hashed password in the server's database.
# Same-origin policy

The **[same-origin policy](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy)** is a critical security mechanism that restricts how a document or script loaded from one {{Glossary("origin")}} can interact with a resource from another origin.

It helps isolate potentially malicious documents, reducing possible attack vectors.

# SCM

SCM (Source Control Management) is a system for managing source code. Usually it refers to the use of software to handle versioning of source files. A programmer can modify source code files without being afraid of editing out useful stuff, because a SCM keeps track of how the source code has changed and who made the changes.

Some SCM systems include CVS, SVN, GIT.

# Scope

The **scope** is the current context of execution in which {{glossary("value","values")}} and expressions are "visible" or can be referenced. If a {{glossary("variable")}} or expression is not in the current scope, it will not be available for use. Scopes can also be layered in a hierarchy, so that child scopes have access to parent scopes, but not vice versa.

JavaScript has the following kinds of scopes:

- Global scope: The default scope for all code running in script mode.
- Module scope: The scope for code running in module mode.
- Function scope: The scope created with a {{glossary("function")}}.

In addition, identifiers declared with certain syntaxes, including [`let`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let), [`const`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const), [`class`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/class), or (in strict mode) [`function`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function), can belong to an additional scope:

- Block scope: The scope created with a pair of curly braces (a [block](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/block)).

A {{glossary("function")}} creates a scope, so that (for example) a variable defined exclusively within the function cannot be accessed from outside the function or within other functions. For instance, the following is invalid:

```js example-bad
function exampleFunction() {
  const x = "declared inside function"; // x can only be used in exampleFunction
  console.log("Inside function");
  console.log(x);
}

console.log(x); // Causes error
```

However, the following code is valid due to the variable being declared outside the function, making it global:

```js example-good
const x = "declared outside function";

exampleFunction();

function exampleFunction() {
  console.log("Inside function");
  console.log(x);
}

console.log("Outside function");
console.log(x);
```

Blocks only scope `let` and `const` declarations, but not `var` declarations.

```js example-good
{
  var x = 1;
}
console.log(x); // 1
```

```js example-bad
{
  const x = 1;
}
console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined
```

# Screen reader

Screen readers are software applications that attempt to convey what is seen on a screen display in a non-visual way, usually as text to speech, but also into braille or sound icons. Screen readers are essential to people who are visually impaired, illiterate, or have a learning disability. There are some browser extension screen readers, but most screen readers operate system-wide for all user applications, not just the browser.

In terms of web {{glossary("accessibility")}}, most user agents provide an accessibility object model and screen readers interact with dedicated accessibility APIs, using various operating system features and employing hooking techniques.

## Common screen readers

### VoiceOver

iOS and macOS comes with VoiceOver, a built-in screen reader. To access VoiceOver on macOS, go to System Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver. You can also toggle VoiceOver on and off with fn + Command + F5. VoiceOver both reads aloud and displays content. The content read aloud is displayed in a dark grey box.

VoiceOver can also be used with commands shortcuts. See [VoiceOver general commands on Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/guide/voiceover/cpvokys01/mac) for a complete list.

See [VoiceOver User Guide for Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/voiceover/welcome/mac) and [Use VoiceOver in apps on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-voiceover-in-apps-iphe4ee74be8/ios) for more information.

### Narrator

Narrator is a screen-reading application that's built into Windows 10 and Windows 11.

See [Complete guide to Narrator](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/complete-guide-to-narrator-e4397a0d-ef4f-b386-d8ae-c172f109bdb1).

### ChromeVox

Chromebooks have a built-in screen reader called ChromeVox, which enables people with visual impairments to use the Chrome operating system.

# Script-supporting element

In an {{Glossary("HTML")}} document, **script-supporting elements** are those elements that don't directly contribute to the appearance or layout of the page; instead, they're either scripts or contain information that's only used by scripts.

These elements may be important, but do not affect the displayed page unless the page's scripts explicitly cause them to do so.

There are only two script-supporting elements: {{HTMLElement("script")}} and {{HTMLElement("template")}}.

## See also

[Script-supporting elements](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Content_categories#script-supporting_elements)
# Scroll boundary

A **scroll boundary** is the point at which a scrollable element cannot be scrolled any further in a particular direction, either at the top or bottom (or left/right for horizontal scrolling). This typically is the edge of the [scrollport](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scroll_container#scrollport).

When the content of a {{Glossary("Scroll_container", "scroll container")}} does not exceed the container size in the scrolling direction, the container is considered to be at its scroll boundary at all times. This is because there's no extra content to scroll through. If the content is prevented from scrolling, such as when {{cssxref("overflow", "overflow: hidden")}} is set, the element is not a scroll container, and therefore, there is no scroll boundary.

When the scroll boundary of the scrollport is reached by a user scrolling the content, a visual effect such as a bounce or a functional action like pull-to-refresh on mobile devices may occur. This default browser behavior is called the **boundary default action**.

For example, on mobile devices, dragging a page downward when already at the top causes a bounce effect and sometimes triggers a page refresh. This bounce or refresh is the boundary default action.

Boundary default actions can be local or non-local.

- A **local boundary default** is the action that occurring at the boundary of a specific scrollable area confined to that element. This action is considered _local_ as it does not affect any ancestor containers or the rest of the webpage.

- A **non-local boundary default action** is when reaching the scroll boundary of a scroll container has effects beyond the specific element being scrolled. An example of this is {{Glossary("Scroll_chaining", "scroll chaining")}}, where reaching the scroll boundary of one element triggers scrolling in a parent or ancestor element, and possibly even initiating a page-wide action, such as navigation.

# Scroll chaining

**Scroll chaining** refers to the behavior observed when a user scrolls past the {{Glossary("Scroll_boundary", "Scroll boundary")}} of a scrollable element, causing scrolling on an ancestor element.

When a user scrolls within a scrollable element such as a `<div>` or `<textarea>` and the [scrollport](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scroll_container#scrollport) boundary (top, bottom, left or right) of the scrollable element is reached, there may be a "chained effect" in which the scroll action is seamlessly propagated to the parent element. This behavior creates a continuous scrolling experience, both vertically and horizontally.

A **scroll chain** is the order of scrollable elements where the scrolling action passes from one element to another. This happens when an inner element is scrolled to its limit, and the scrolling continues to its parent element, creating a 'chain' of scrolling actions. Chaining typically recurses up the containing block.

# Scroll container

A **scroll container** is an element box in which content can be scrolled, whether or not scroll bars are present. A user agent adds scroll bars to an element box to make it a scroll container when the CSS {{cssxref("overflow")}} property is set to `scroll` or when `overflow` is set to `auto` _and_ the content overflows the container.

When the content of an element box overflows its bounding box, users can use scroll bars to scroll through the clipped content that is otherwise hidden from view.

A scroll container includes a scrollport and scroll bars.

## Scrollport

The scrollport is the visible part of a scroll container and coincides with the padding box of the scroll container. The scroll bars are used to move content in and out of the scrollport so that the content can be viewed.

# Scroll snap

**Scroll snapping** is when content "snaps" to a specific position, rather than stopping at any random point, when a scroll operation finishes. Normal scrolling operations lack precision. They don't align to a paragraph, a sentence, or an image boundary. For example, in a carousel, a scrolling operation could finish in the middle of an image, leaving it partially visible. Web developers have long relied on JavaScript-based solutions. Browsers have recently started supporting [CSS scroll-snapping features](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_scroll_snap) that enable defining scroll-snap containers and snapping behaviors.

Scroll snapping is a well-controlled scrolling experience, whereby developers define an element as a [scroll container](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scroll_container) with boundaries for scroll operations. Scroll operations then finish at these snap position boundaries, with the scrolled to content snapping into place. In the above carousel example, as the user finishes scrolling the carousel, its visible image will snap into place.

- Scroll snap container
  - : The **scroll snap container** is a scroll container with scroll snapping applied. For example, if a box has overflowing content and a {{CSSXref("scroll-snap-type")}} set to a value other than `none`, then the box captures snap positions. A box's scroll snap container is the element's nearest snap-position capturing scroll container ancestor. If a box has no scroll snap container, its snap positions, if any, will not trigger snapping.
- Snapport
  - : The **snapport** ​is the area of the [scrollport](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scroll_container#scrollport) that is used as the alignment container for the scroll snap areas when calculating snap positions. By default, it is the same as the scroll container's visual viewport, but is the area of the scrollport defined by the {{CSSXref("scroll-padding")}} property. The [snap areas](#snap_area) are aligned to the scrollport.
- Snap area
  - : The **snap area** of an element in a scroll container is the area defined using {{CSSXref("scroll-margin")}} outsets specified on the element. The snap area is used to snap the element to its snapport.
- Snap target
  - : A descendant element inside a scroll snap container that is snapped to when the container scrolls. The {{CSSXref("scroll-snap-align")}} property defines the snap position of each snap target.

# SCTP

**SCTP** (Stream Control Transmission {{glossary("Protocol")}}) is an {{Glossary("IETF")}} standard for a transport protocol which enables the reliable, in-order transmission of messages while offering congestion control, multi-homing, and other features to improve reliability and stability of the connection. It's used for sending traditional telephone calls over the Internet, but is also used for {{Glossary("WebRTC")}} data.

# SDK (Software Development Kit)

An **SDK** (**Software Development Kit**) is an integrated collection of tools that a developer can use to create software for a specific framework, operating system, or other platform. An SDK can include:

- An editor
- A compiler
- A debugger
- An emulator or simulator, if the target platform is different from the platform used to create the program.
- Tools to help test and package the program for distribution.

SDKs are usually provided by the owner of a software platform, to support developers targeting the platform. For example, Google provides an [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio) for developers writing Android apps.

In many respects, the {{Glossary("developer tools")}} built into modern web browsers provide a similar function for web developers.
# SDP

**SDP** (Session Description {{glossary("Protocol")}}) is the standard describing a {{Glossary("P2P","peer-to-peer")}} connection. SDP contains the {{Glossary("codec")}}, source address, and timing information of audio and video.

Here is a typical SDP message:

```plain
v=0
o=alice 2890844526 2890844526 IN IP4 host.anywhere.com
s=
c=IN IP4 host.anywhere.com
t=0 0
m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 0
a=rtpmap:0 PCMU/8000
m=video 51372 RTP/AVP 31
a=rtpmap:31 H261/90000
m=video 53000 RTP/AVP 32
a=rtpmap:32 MPV/90000
```

SDP is never used alone, but by protocols like {{Glossary("RTP")}} and {{Glossary("RTSP")}}. SDP is also a component of {{Glossary("WebRTC")}}, which uses SDP as a way of describing a session.

# Search engine

A search engine is a software system that collects information from the {{Glossary("World Wide Web")}} and presents it to users who are looking for specific information.

A search engine conducts the following processes:

- **Web crawling:** Searching websites by navigating {{Glossary("Hyperlink", "Hyperlinks")}} on web pages, both within a site, and from one site to another. A website owner can exclude areas of the site from being accessed by a search engine's _web crawler_ (or _spider_), by defining "robot exclusion" information in a file named `robots.txt`.
- **Indexing:** Associating keywords and other information with specific web pages that have been crawled. This enables users to find relevant pages as quickly as possible.
- **Searching:** Looking for relevant web pages based on queries consisting of key words and other commands to the search engine. The search engine finds the URLs of pages that match the query, and ranks them based on their relevance. It then presents results to the user in order of the ranking.

The most popular search engine is Google. Other top search engines include Yahoo!, Bing, Baidu, and AOL.

# Secure context

A **secure context** is a `Window` or `Worker` in which certain minimum standards of authentication and confidentiality are met. Many Web APIs and features are only accessible in secure contexts, reducing the opportunity for misuse by malicious code.

For more information see: [Web > Security > Secure Contexts](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts).
# Semantics

In programming, **Semantics** refers to the _meaning_ of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)

## Semantics in JavaScript

In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an {{htmlelement("li")}} element with that string as its `textContent`. Would you need to look at the code to understand what the function did if it was called `build('Peach')`, or `createLiWithContent('Peach')`?

## Semantics in CSS

In CSS, consider styling a list with `li` elements representing different types of fruits. Would you know what part of the DOM is being selected with `div > ul > li`, or `.fruits__item`?

## Semantics in HTML

In HTML, for example, the {{htmlelement("Heading_Elements", "h1")}} element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."

```html
<h1>This is a top level heading</h1>
```

By default, most browser's [user agent stylesheet](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Cascade#user-agent_stylesheets) will style an {{htmlelement("Heading_Elements", "h1")}} with a large font size to make it _look_ like a heading (although you could style it to look like anything you wanted).

On the other hand, you could make any element _look_ like a top level heading. Consider the following:

```html
<span style="font-size: 32px; margin: 21px 0;">Not a top-level heading!</span>
```

This will render it to look like a top level heading, but it has no semantic value, so it will not get any extra benefits as described above. It is therefore a good idea to use the right HTML element for the right job.

HTML should be coded to represent the _data_ that will be populated and not based on its default presentation styling. Presentation (how it should look), is the sole responsibility of [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS).

Some of the benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:

- Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see {{glossary("SEO")}})
- Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page
- Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless `div`s with or without semantic or namespaced classes
- Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated
- Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming

When approaching which markup to use, ask yourself, "What element(s) best describe/represent the data that I'm going to populate?" For example, is it a list of data?; ordered, unordered?; is it an article with sections and an aside of related information?; does it list out definitions?; is it a figure or image that needs a caption?; should it have a header and a footer in addition to the global site-wide header and footer?; etc.

## Semantic elements

These are _some_ of the roughly 100 semantic [elements](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements) available:

- {{htmlelement("article")}}
- {{htmlelement("aside")}}
- {{htmlelement("details")}}
- {{htmlelement("figcaption")}}
- {{htmlelement("figure")}}
- {{htmlelement("footer")}}
- {{htmlelement("form")}}
- {{htmlelement("header")}}
- {{htmlelement("main")}}
- {{htmlelement("mark")}}
- {{htmlelement("nav")}}
- {{htmlelement("section")}}
- {{htmlelement("summary")}}
- {{htmlelement("time")}}

# SEO

**SEO** (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of making a website more visible in search results, also termed improving search rankings.

Search engines {{Glossary("Crawler", "crawl")}} the web, following links from page to page, and index the content found. When you search, the search engine displays the indexed content. Crawlers follow rules. If you follow those rules closely when doing SEO for a website, you give the site the best chances of showing up among the first results, increasing traffic and possibly revenue (for e-commerce and ads).

Search engines give some guidelines for SEO, but big search engines keep result ranking as a trade secret. SEO combines official search engine guidelines, empirical knowledge, and theoretical knowledge from science papers or patents.

SEO methods fall into three broad classes:

- Technical
  - : Tag the content using semantic {{Glossary("HTML")}}. When exploring the website, crawlers should only find the content you want indexed.
- Copywriting
  - : Write content using your visitors' vocabulary. Use text as well as images so that crawlers can understand the subject.
- Popularity
  - : You get most traffic when other established sites link to your site.

# Serializable object

**Serializable objects** are objects that can be serialized and later deserialized in any JavaScript environment ("realm").
This allows them to, for example, be stored on disk and later restored, or cloned with {{DOMxRef("Window.structuredClone", "structuredClone()")}}, or shared between workers using {{domxref("DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope.postMessage()")}}.

The serialization may not include all the properties and other aspects of the original object.
For example, a serialization of a {{domxref("DOMException")}} must include the `name` and `message` properties, but whether it includes other properties is implementation dependent.
As a result, a deserialized object may not be an identical clone/copy of the original object.
The new deserialized object will however be a {{glossary("deep copy")}}, so any properties that were serialized from the original object and then deserialized into the new object will share no references with the original object.

In some cases when serializing and deserializing an object, it makes sense to transfer some resources rather than creating a copy.
Objects that can be transferred are called [Transferable objects](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Transferable_objects).

## Supported objects

All primitive values are serializable.
Not all objects are serializable objects.
The objects that can be serialized are listed in: [The structured clone algorithm > Supported types](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm#supported_types)

> [!NOTE]
> Serializable objects are marked up in [Web IDL files](https://github.com/w3c/webref/tree/main/ed/idl) with the attribute `[Serializable]`.
# Serialization

The process whereby an object or data structure is translated into a format suitable for transfer over a network, or storage (e.g., in an array buffer or file format).

In {{Glossary("JavaScript")}}, for example, you can serialize an object to a {{Glossary("JSON")}} {{Glossary("string")}} by calling the {{Glossary("function")}} {{jsxref("JSON.stringify()")}}.

{{Glossary("CSS")}} values are serialized by calling the function {{domxref("CSSStyleDeclaration.getPropertyValue()")}}.

# Server

A server is a software or hardware offering a service to a user, usually referred to as client. A hardware server is a shared computer on a network, usually powerful and housed in a data center. A software server (often running on a hardware server) is a program that provides services to client programs or a {{glossary("UI","user interface")}} to human clients.

Services are provided generally over local area networks or wide area networks such as the internet. A client program and server program traditionally connect by passing messages encoded using a {{glossary("protocol")}} over an {{glossary("API")}}.

For example:

- An Internet-connected Web server is sending a {{glossary("HTML")}} file to your browser software so that you can read this page
- Local area network server for file, name, mail, print, and fax
- Minicomputers, mainframes, and super computers at data centers

# Server Timing

The [Server Timing specification](https://w3c.github.io/server-timing/) enables the server to communicate performance metrics from the request-response cycle to the user agent, and utilizes a JavaScript interface to allow applications to collect, process, and act on these metrics to optimize application delivery.

# Session hijacking

**Session hijacking** occurs when an attacker takes over a valid session between two computers. The attacker steals a valid session ID in order to break into the system and snoop data.

Most authentication occurs only at the start of a {{glossary("TCP")}} session. In TCP session hijacking, an attacker gains access by taking over a TCP session between two machines in mid session.

![The attacker sniffs and accesses a legitimate session id from a user interacting with a web server, then uses that session identifier to spoof the session between the regular user and the server to exploit the user's session and access the server directly.](session_hijacking_3.jpg)

### Session hijacking occurs because

- no account lockout for invalid session IDs
- weak session-ID generation algorithm
- insecure handling
- indefinite session expiration time
- short session IDs
- transmission in plain text

### Session hijacking process

1. **Sniff**, that is perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, place yourself between victim and server.
2. **Monitor** packets flowing between server and user.
3. **Break** the victim machine's connection.
4. **Take control** of the session.
5. **Inject** new packets to the server using the Victim's Session ID.

### Protection against session hijacking

- create a secure communication channel with SSH (secure shell)
- pass authentication cookies over HTTPS connection
- implement logout functionality so the user can end the session
- generate the session ID after successful login
- pass encrypted data between the users and the web server
- use a string or long random number as a session key

# SGML

The _Standard Generalized Markup Language_ (**SGML**) is an {{Glossary("ISO")}} specification for defining declarative markup languages.

On the web, {{Glossary("HTML")}} 4, {{Glossary("XHTML")}}, and {{Glossary("XML")}} are popular SGML-based languages. It is worth noting that since its fifth edition, HTML is no longer SGML-based and has its own parsing rules.

# Shadow tree

A **shadow tree** is a hidden set of {{Glossary("DOM")}} nodes whose topmost {{Glossary("node/dom", "node")}} is a **shadow root**. The shadow root is the topmost node of a **shadow DOM** and not part of the regular document's DOM tree.

The shadow root is attached to another node tree through a specific DOM node referred to as its **host**. This host may be part of another shadow tree or part of the regular DOM tree. The node tree of a shadow root's host is sometimes referred to as the **light tree**.

The hidden DOM nodes of a shadow tree are generally not affected by anything applied outside the shadow tree, and vice versa. The **shadow boundary**, where the shadow DOM ends and the regular DOM begins, can be traversed, but only very intentionally:

- Scripting shadow tree nodes from outside requires the use of a special [Shadow DOM API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM) to be accessed.
- Styling a shadow tree from outside can be achieved via [CSS scoping](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_scoping) and [CSS shadow parts](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_shadow_parts).

# Shallow copy

A **shallow copy** of an object is a copy whose properties share the same {{Glossary("object reference", "references")}} (point to the same underlying values) as those of the source object from which the copy was made. As a result, when you change either the source or the copy, you may also cause the other object to change too. That behavior contrasts with the behavior of a {{Glossary("deep copy")}}, in which the source and copy are completely independent.

More formally, two objects `o1` and `o2` are shallow copies if:

1. They are not the same object (`o1 !== o2`).
2. The properties of `o1` and `o2` have the same names in the same order.
3. The values of their properties are equal.
4. Their prototype chains are equal.

See also the definition of _{{Glossary("deep copy", "structural equivalence")}}_.

The copy of an object whose properties all have primitive values fits the definition of both a {{Glossary("deep copy")}} and a shallow copy. It is somewhat useless to talk about the depth of such a copy, though, because it has no nested properties and we usually talk about deep copying in the context of mutating nested properties.

For shallow copies, only the top-level properties are copied, not the values of nested objects. Therefore:

- Re-assigning top-level properties of the copy does not affect the source object.
- Re-assigning nested object properties of the copy does affect the source object.

In JavaScript, all standard built-in object-copy operations ([spread syntax](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax), [`Array.prototype.concat()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat), [`Array.prototype.slice()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice), [`Array.from()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from), and [`Object.assign()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign)) create shallow copies rather than deep copies.

Consider the following example, in which an `ingredientsList` array object is created, and then an `ingredientsListCopy` object is created by copying that `ingredientsList` object.

```js
const ingredientsList = ["noodles", { list: ["eggs", "flour", "water"] }];

const ingredientsListCopy = Array.from(ingredientsList);
console.log(ingredientsListCopy);
// ["noodles",{"list":["eggs","flour","water"]}]
```

Re-assigning the value of a nested property will be visible in both objects.

```js
ingredientsListCopy[1].list = ["rice flour", "water"];
console.log(ingredientsList[1].list);
// Array [ "rice flour", "water" ]
```

Re-assigning the value of a top-level property (the `0` index in this case) will only be visible in the changed object.

```js
ingredientsListCopy[0] = "rice noodles";
console.log(ingredientsList[0]); // noodles
console.log(JSON.stringify(ingredientsListCopy));
// ["rice noodles",{"list":["rice flour","water"]}]
console.log(JSON.stringify(ingredientsList));
// ["noodles",{"list":["rice flour","water"]}]
```

# Shim

A **shim** is a piece of code used to correct the behavior of code that already exists, usually by adding new API that works around the problem. This differs from a {{Glossary("polyfill")}}, which implements a new API that is not supported by the stock browser as shipped.

# Signature (functions)

A **function signature** (or _type_ signature, or _method_ signature) defines input and output of {{Glossary("Function", "functions")}} or {{Glossary("Method", "methods")}}.

A signature can include:

- {{Glossary("Parameter", "parameters")}} and their {{Glossary("Type", "types")}}
- a return value and type
- {{Glossary("Exception", "exceptions")}} that might be thrown or passed back
- information about the availability of the method in an {{Glossary("OOP", "object-oriented")}} program (such as the keywords `public`, `static`, or `prototype`).

## In depth

### Signatures in JavaScript

{{Glossary("JavaScript")}} is a _loosely typed_ or a _dynamic_ language. That means you don't have to declare the type of a variable ahead of time. The type will get determined automatically while the program is being processed. A signature in JavaScript can still give you some information about the method:

```js
MyObject.prototype.myFunction(value);
```

- The method is installed on an {{Glossary("object")}} called `MyObject`.
- The method is installed on the `prototype` of `MyObject` (thus it is an {{Glossary("Method", "instance method")}}) as opposed to being a {{Glossary("static method")}}.
- The name of the method is `myFunction`.
- The method accepts one parameter, which is called `value` and is not further defined.

### Signatures in Java

In {{Glossary("Java")}}, signatures are used to identify methods and classes at the level of the virtual machine code. You have to declare types of variables in your code in order to be able to run the Java code. Java is _strictly typed_ and will check any parameters at compilation time if they are correct.

```java
public static void main(String[] args)
```

- The `public` keyword is an access modifier and indicates that this method can be called by any object.
- The `static` keyword indicates that this method is a class method as opposed to being an instance method.
- The `void` keyword indicates that this method has no return value.
- The name of the method is `main`.
- The method accepts one parameter of type String Array. It is named `args`.

# Signature (security)

A **signature**, or _digital signature_, is a {{glossary("protocol")}} showing that a message is authentic.

From the {{glossary("hash function", "hash")}} of a given message, the **signing process** first generates a digital signature linked to the signing entity, using the entity's private {{glossary("key")}}.

On receiving the message, the **verification process**

- _authenticates the sender -_ uses the sender's public key to {{glossary("decryption","decrypt")}} the signature and recover the hash, which can only be created with the sender's private key, and
- _checks message integrity -_ compares the hash with a newly calculated one from the received document (the two hashes will differ if the document has been tampered with)

The system fails if the private key is compromised or the recipient is deceitfully given the wrong public key.

Digital signatures rely on asymmetric cryptography, also known as [public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography).

# SIMD

SIMD (pronounced "sim-dee") is short for **Single Instruction/Multiple Data** which is one [classification of computer architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn%27s_taxonomy). SIMD allows one same operation to be performed on multiple data points resulting in data level parallelism and thus performance gains — for example, for 3D graphics and video processing, physics simulations or cryptography, and other domains.

See also {{Glossary("SISD")}} for a sequential architecture with no parallelism in either the instructions or the data sets.

# SISD

SISD is short for **Single Instruction/Single Data** which is one [classification of computer architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn%27s_taxonomy). In SISD architecture, a single processor executes a single instruction and operates on a single data point in memory.

See also {{Glossary("SIMD")}} for a parallel architecture that allows one same operation to be performed on multiple data points.

# Site

Informally, a _site_ is a website, which is a collection of web pages, served from the same domain, and maintained by a single organization.

Browsers sometimes need to distinguish precisely between different sites. For example, the browser must only send [`SameSite`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Set-Cookie#samesitesamesite-value) cookies to the same site that set them.

For this more precise definition a site is determined by the _registrable domain_ portion of the domain name. The registrable domain consists of an entry in the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/list/) plus the portion of the domain name just before it. This means that, for example, `theguardian.co.uk`, `sussex.ac.uk`, and `bookshop.org` are all registrable domains.

According to this definition, `support.mozilla.org` and `developer.mozilla.org` are part of the same site, because `mozilla.org` is a registrable domain.

In some contexts, the scheme is also considered when differentiating sites. This would make `http://vpl.ca` and `https://vpl.ca` different sites. Including the scheme prevents an insecure (HTTP) site from being treated as the same site as a secure (HTTPS) site. A definition that considers the scheme is sometimes called a _schemeful same-site_. This stricter definition is applied in the rules for handling [`SameSite`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Set-Cookie#samesitesamesite-value) cookies.

> [!NOTE]
> Browsers sometimes make security decisions (for example, deciding which resources a script can access) based on the {{Glossary("Origin")}} of a resource. This is a more restrictive concept than the site, encompassing the scheme, the whole domain, and the port. See also [same-origin policy](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy).

## Examples

These are the same site because the registrable domain of `mozilla.org` is the same:

- `https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/`
- `https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/`

These are considered the same site because the port number is ignored when determining the site:

- `https://example.com:8080`
- `https://example.com`

These are not the same site because the registrable domain of the two URLs differs:

- `https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/`
- `https://example.com`

These are the same site, or different sites if the scheme is considered:

- `http://example.com`
- `https://example.com`

# Site map

A **site map** or **sitemap** is a list of pages of a website.

Structured listings of a site's page help with {{Glossary("seo", "search engine optimization")}} (SEO), providing a link for web crawlers such as search engines to follow. Site maps also help users with site navigation by providing an overview of a site's content in a single glance.
# SLD

The **Second Level Domain (SLD)** is the part of the domain name that is located right before a _{{Glossary("TLD", "Top Level Domain (TLD)")}}_.

For example, in `mozilla.org` the SLD is `mozilla` and the TLD is `org`.

A domain name is not limited to a TLD and SLD. Additional subdomains can be created to provide additional information about various server functions or to delimit areas under the same domain. For example, `www` is a commonly used subdomain to indicate that the domain points to a web server.

As another example, in `developer.mozilla.org`, the `developer` subdomain is used to specify that the subdomain contains the developer section of the Mozilla website.

# Sloppy mode

{{Glossary("ECMAScript")}} 5 and later let scripts opt in to a new [strict mode](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode), which alters the semantics of JavaScript in several ways to improve its resiliency and which make it easier to understand what's going on when there are problems.

The normal, non-strict mode of JavaScript is sometimes referred to as **sloppy mode**. This isn't an official designation, but you are likely to come across it if you spend time doing serious JavaScript code.

## See also

# Slug

A Slug is the unique identifying part of a web address, typically at the end of the URL. In the context of MDN, it is the portion of the URL following "_\<locale>/docs/_".

It may also just be the final component when a new document is created under a parent document; for example, this page's slug is `Glossary/Slug`.

# Smoke test

A smoke test consists of functional or unit tests of critical software functionality. Smoke testing comes before further, in-depth testing.

Smoke testing answers questions like

- "Does the program start up correctly?"
- "Do the main control buttons function?"
- "Can you save a simple blank new test user account?"

If this basic functionality fails, there is no point investing time in more detailed QA work at this stage.

The protocol is relatively straightforward. Primary complications include supporting various authentication mechanisms ([GSSAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_Security_Services_Application_Program_Interface), [CRAM-MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRAM-MD5), [NTLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTLM), MSN, AUTH LOGIN, AUTH PLAIN, etc.), handling error responses, and falling back when authentication mechanisms fail (e.g., the server claims to support a mechanism, but doesn't).

# Snake case

**Snake case** is a way of writing phrases without spaces, where spaces are replaced with underscores `_`, and the words are typically all lower case. It's often stylized as "snake_case" to remind the reader of its appearance.

Snake casing is often used as a variable naming convention. The following names are in snake case: `left_shift`, `bitwise_invert`, `matrix_transpose`.

Note that snake case never contains upper case letters. Sometimes, constants are written in all-uppercase, such as JavaScript's {{jsxref("Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER")}}. This is not typically considered as snake case. Instead, it is sometimes called _screaming snake case_.

Snake case is the most popular convention in Python, Rust, and various other languages.

# Snap positions

Snap positions are points where the {{Glossary("scroll container", "scrollport")}} stops moving after the scrolling operation completes. Setting up snap positions allows to create a scrolling experience of paging through content instead of needing to drag content into view.

Snap positions are set up on a {{Glossary("scroll container")}}. See the [CSS Scroll Snap](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_scroll_snap) properties.

# Social engineering

In computer security, **social engineering** is a technique in which an attacker psychologically manipulates users into harmful actions, such as divulging their {{glossary("credential", "credentials")}} or other sensitive information.

For example, in a [phishing](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/Phishing) attack, the user thinks that they are signing into a site with which they have an account, when in reality they are giving their login details to a fake site controlled by the attacker.

Social engineering attacks can be distinguished from other attacks because they do not target vulnerabilities in software or hardware, but target users, causing them to make bad decisions. This can make them hard to defend against, although system design choices can make them less likely to succeed or even effectively impossible.

Defenses against social engineering attacks often focus on teaching users safe practices, such as not clicking links in emails. However, experience has shown that all users can be vulnerable to social engineering attacks especially when they are tired, busy, or stressed.
# Source map

A **source map** is a {{Glossary("JSON")}} file format that maps between minified or transformed code received by the browser and its original unmodified form, allowing the original code to be reconstructed and used when debugging.

Code executed by the browser is often transformed in some way from the original source created by a developer. There are several reasons for this:

- To make delivering code from the server more efficient by combining and minifying source files.
- To support older browsers by transforming modern features into older equivalents.
- To use languages that browsers don't support, like {{Glossary("TypeScript")}} or [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).

In these situations, debugging the original source is much easier than the source in the transformed state that the browser has downloaded.
Browsers detect a source map via the {{HTTPHeader("SourceMap")}} HTTP header for a resource, or a `sourceMappingURL` annotation in the generated code.

## Example

For example, consider this SCSS syntax of Sass:

```scss
ul {
  list-style: none;
  li {
    display: inline;
  }
}
```

During the build process, the SCSS is transformed into CSS.
A source map file `index.css.map` is generated and linked to from the CSS in a comment at the end:

```css
ul {
  list-style: none;
}
ul li {
  display: inline;
}

/*# sourceMappingURL=index.css.map */
```

This map file contains not only mappings between the original SCSS and the generated CSS but also the original SCSS source code in encoded form. It's ignored by the browser's CSS parser but used by browser's DevTools:

```json
{
  "version": 3,
  "sourceRoot": "",
  "sources": ["index.scss"],
  "names": [],
  "mappings": "AAAA;EACC;;AACA;EACC",
  "file": "index.css"
}
```

The source map allows the browser's DevTools to link to specific lines in the original SCSS file and display the source code:

![Firefox DevTools focused on the li element in the DOM inspector. The style panel shows transformed CSS without nesting and a link to the third line of the index.scss file.](inspector.png)

![Firefox DevTools with the index.scss file opened in the style editor. The editor is focused on the source code's third line in SCSS format with nesting.](style-editor.png)

# SPA (Single-page application)

An SPA (Single-page application) is a web app implementation that loads only a single web document, and then updates the body content of that single document via JavaScript APIs such as [Fetch](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) when different content is to be shown.

This therefore allows users to use websites without loading whole new pages from the server, which can result in performance gains and a more dynamic experience, with some tradeoff disadvantages such as SEO, more effort required to maintain state, implement navigation, and do meaningful performance monitoring.

# Specification

A **specification** is a document that lays out in detail what functionality or attributes a product must include before delivery. In the context of describing the Web, the term "specification" (often shortened to "spec") generally means a document describing a language, technology, or {{Glossary("API")}} which makes up the complete set of open Web technologies.

# Speculative parsing

Traditionally in browsers the HTML parser ran on the main thread and was blocked after a `</script>` tag until the script has been retrieved from the network and executed. Some HTML parser, such as Firefox since Firefox 4, support speculative parsing off of the main thread. It parses ahead while scripts are being downloaded and executed. The HTML parser starts speculative loads for scripts, style sheets and images it finds ahead in the stream and runs the HTML tree construction algorithm speculatively. The upside is that when a speculation succeeds, there's no need to reparse the part of the incoming file that was already scanned for scripts, style sheets and images. The downside is that there's more work lost when the speculation fails.

This document helps you avoid the kind of things that make speculation fail and slow down the loading of your page.

To make speculative loads of linked scripts, style sheets and images successful, avoid {{domxref('document.write')}}. If you use a `<base>` element to override the base URI of your page, put the element in the non-scripted part of the document. Don't add it via `document.write()` or {{domxref('document.createElement')}}.

## Avoiding losing tree builder output

Speculative tree building fails when `document.write()` changes the tree builder state such that the speculative state after the `</script>` tag no longer holds when all the content inserted by `document.write()` has been parsed. However, only unusual uses of `document.write()` cause trouble. Here are the things to avoid:

- Don't write unbalanced trees. `<script>document.write("<div>");</script>` is bad. `<script>document.write("<div></div>");</script>` is OK.
- Don't write an unfinished token. `<script>document.write("<div></div");</script>` is bad.
- Don't finish your writing with a carriage return. `<script>document.write("Hello World!\r");</script>` is bad. `<script>document.write("Hello World!\n");</script>` is OK.
- Note that writing balanced tags may cause other tags to be inferred in a way that makes the write unbalanced. E.g. `<script>document.write("<div></div>");</script>` inside the `head` element will be interpreted as `<script>document.write("</head><body><div></div>");</script>` which is unbalanced.
- Don't format part of a table. `<table><script>document.write("<tr><td>Hello World!</td></tr>");</script></table>` is bad.
# Speed index

**Speed Index** (SI) is a page load performance metric measuring how quickly the contents of a page are visibly populated. Speed Index is dependent on size of the viewport and expressed in milliseconds: the lower amount of time the better the score.

Speed Index was introduced to address issues with other milestones and metrics and provide a gauge of real user experience. Speed Index has been implemented in several common audits including [WebPageTest](https://github.com/catchpoint/WebPageTest.docs/blob/main/src/metrics/SpeedIndex.md) and [Lighthouse](https://github.com/paulirish/speedline).

Speed Index is calculated by what percent of the page is visually complete at every 100ms interval until the page is visually complete. The overall score is a sum of the individual 10 times per second intervals of the percent of the screen that is not visually complete.

# SQL

**SQL** (Structured Query Language) is a descriptive computer language designed for updating, retrieving, and calculating data in table-based databases.

# SQL injection

SQL injection takes advantage of Web apps that fail to validate user input. Hackers can maliciously pass SQL commands through the Web app for execution by a backend database.

SQL injection can gain unauthorized access to a database or to retrieve information directly from the database. Many data breaches are due to SQL injection.

![Pie chart of most common vulnerabilities: SQL Injection is responsible for 50% of vulnerabilities, Cross Site Scripting is responsible for 42% of vulnerabilities, Source Code Disclosure is responsible for 7% of vulnerabilities.](sql_inj_xss.gif)

[Original source](https://cdn.acunetix.com/wp_content/uploads/2010/09/sql_inj_xss.gif)

## How It Works

![Screenshot of the login form with username and password fields](updates_loginscreen.png)

After entering username and password, behind the GUI the SQL queries work as follows:

```sql
"SELECT Count(*) FROM Users WHERE Username=' " + txt.User.Text+" ' AND Password=' "+ txt.Password.Text+" ' ";
```

Now suppose User enters the Username: admin and Password: passwd123, so after clicking on the Log in button, SQL query will run as follows:

```sql
"SELECT Count(*) FROM Users WHERE Username=' admin ' AND Password=' passwd123 ' ";
```

If the credentials are correct, then the user is allowed to log in, so it's a very simple (and therefore insecure) mechanism. Hackers use this insecurity to gain unauthorized access.

Hackers use a simple string called a Magical String, for example:

**Username: _admin_**

**Password: _anything 'or'1'='1_**

After clicking on the login button, the SQL query will work as follows:

```sql
"SELECT Count(*) FROM Users WHERE Username=' admin ' AND Password=' anything 'or'1'='1 ' ";
```

Just take a closer look at the above query's password section.

```plain
Password=' anything 'or'1'='1 '
```

The password is not 'anything', hence password=anything results in FALSE, but '1'='1' is a TRUE statement and hence returns a TRUE value. Finally, due to the OR operator, the value (FALSE OR TRUE) is TRUE, so authentication bypasses successfully. Just due to a simple string (Magical String) the entire database is compromised.

## How To Prevent

Before executing the queries for the user credentials, make some changes like the following:

```php
$id = $_GET["id"]

(1) $id = stripslashes($id)

(2) $id = mysql_real_escape_String($id)
```

So due to (1) each single quote (') in the input string is replaced with double quotes ("), and due to (2) before every (') it adds (/). The revised magical string fails to bypass the authentication, and your database stays secure.

# SRI

**Subresource Integrity** (SRI) is a security feature that enables browsers to verify that files they fetch (for example, from a {{Glossary("CDN")}}) are delivered without unexpected manipulation. It works by allowing you to provide a cryptographic hash that a fetched file must match.

# Static site generator (SSG)

A **static site generator** (SSG) is a software used to generate _static_ websites. A static website is comprised of {{glossary("HTML")}}, {{glossary("CSS")}}, and {{glossary("JavaScript")}} files. Most importantly static sites do not have [server-side logic](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side), so for any given URL, all users will receive the same content. Authors write content in any form accepted by the generator, such as Markdown, reStructuredText, HTML, (and sometimes even [React](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Frameworks_libraries/React_getting_started), and so on), and the generator compiles them into a set of optimized static files that can be rendered by the browser.

Static sites are commonly used for blogs, documentation, and other content-driven websites, which don't have data that needs to be fetched or generated server-side. They are fast, secure, and easy to deploy, because they can be served from a {{glossary("CDN")}}.

# Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL, was the old standard security technology for creating an encrypted network link between a server and client, ensuring all data passed is private and secure. The current version of SSL is version 3.0, released by Netscape in 1996, and has been superseded by the {{Glossary("TLS", "Transport Layer Security (TLS)")}} protocol.

# Server-side rendering (SSR)

**Server-side rendering** (SSR) refers to the practice of generating HTML content on the server and sending it to the client. SSR is opposed to {{glossary("CSR", "client-side rendering")}}, where the client generates the HTML content using JavaScript. Both techniques are not mutually exclusive and can be used together in the same application.

A {{glossary("SSG", "static site")}} can be considered as SSR (and can be generated using SSR infrastructure), but there are nuanced differences. Content of a static site is generated at build time, not at request time. Static sites often do not need to be deployed on a server at all, and can be served from a {{glossary("CDN")}}.

The SSR/CSR distinction is more meaningful for sites with dynamic content, for example live-updating or user-specific content. In these cases, for every request, the server generates the HTML content on-the-fly because it is unrealistic to pregenerate every possible page. The HTML file contains near-complete page content, and any JavaScript asset is only to enable interactivity.

Benefits of SSR include:

- Accessibility: the page is (somewhat) usable without JavaScript, for example if Internet is slow, the user has disabled JavaScript, or the browser is old and JavaScript fails to run. However, any interactivity or client-side logic will not work.
- Crawler-friendliness: search engines, social media crawlers, and other bots can easily read the content without needing to execute JavaScript. Note that major search engines are capable of executing JavaScript so pure CSR sites can still be indexed, but social media crawlers usually cannot.
- Performance: the server can know ahead-of-time what content is needed and can fetch all necessary data at once, compared to CSR where the client is often only aware of further dependencies when it renders the initial page, causing a waterfall of requests.

Both SSR and CSR have their performance tradeoffs, and a mix of SSR and CSR can be used to combine the benefits of both techniques. For example, the server can generate a page skeleton with empty placeholders, and the client can fetch additional data and update the page as needed.

# Stacking context

**Stacking context** refers to how elements on a webpage appear to sit on top of other elements, just as you can arrange index cards on your desk to lie side-by-side or overlap each other.

# State machine

A state machine is a mathematical abstraction used to design algorithms. A state machine reads a set of inputs and changes to a different state based on those inputs.

A state is a description of the status of a system waiting to execute a transition. A transition is a set of actions to execute when a condition is fulfilled or an event received. In a state diagram, circles represent each possible state and arrows represent transitions between states.

Looking at the final state, you can discern something about the series of inputs leading to that state.

There are two types of basic state machines:

- deterministic finite state machine
  - : This kind allows only one possible transition for any allowed input. This is like the "if" {{Glossary("statement")}} in that `if x then doThis else doThat` is not possible. The computer must perform _one_ of the two options.
- non-deterministic finite state machine
  - : Given some state, an input can lead to more than one different state.

_Figure 1: Deterministic Finite State Machine._

![The machine transitions from state 1 to state 2 for input X and from state 1 to state 3 for input Y](statemachine1.png)

In _Figure 1_, the state begins in State 1; the state changes to State 2 given input 'X', or to State 3 given input 'Y'.

_Figure 2: Non-Deterministic Finite State Machine._

![The machine may remain in state 1, transitioning to itself, or may transition from state 1 to state 2 for input X](statemachine2.png)

In _Figure 2_, given input 'X', the state can persist or change to State 2.

Note that any {{Glossary("regular expression")}} can be represented by a state machine.

# Static method

A static method (or _static function_) is a {{Glossary("method")}} defined as a member of an {{Glossary("object")}} but is accessible directly from an API object's constructor, rather than from an object instance created via the constructor.

In a [Web API](/en-US/docs/Web/API), a static method is one which is defined by an interface but can be called without instantiating an object of that type first.

Methods called on object instances are called _instance methods_.

## Examples

In the [Notifications API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API), the {{domxref("Notification/requestPermission_static", "Notification.requestPermission()")}} method is called on the actual {{domxref("Notification")}} constructor itself — it is a static method:

```js
let promise = Notification.requestPermission();
```

The {{domxref("Notification.close()")}} method on the other hand, is an instance method — it is called on a specific notification object instance to close the system notification it represents:

```js
let myNotification = new Notification("This is my notification");

myNotification.close();
```

# Static typing

A **statically-typed** language is a language (such as Java, C, or C++) where variable types are known at compile time. In most of these languages, types must be expressly indicated by the programmer; in other cases (such as OCaml), type inference allows the programmer to not indicate their variable types.

# Sticky activation

**Sticky activation** (or "sticky user activation") is a window state that indicates a user has meaningfully and directly interacted with the window since page load.
Once active, the state lasts for the duration of the session.

The state is enabled following any user interaction, when the window has focus, that results in the browser generating one or more of the following:

- A `mousedown` or `pointerdown` event for a mouse.
- A `pointerup` event for any other kind of pointer.
- A `touchend` event.
- A `keydown` event, other than for the escape or browser shortcut keys.

The window is not user-activated by events that aren't necessarily caused by intentional interaction with the window, such as mouse move events or `wheel` events.

Sticky activation is used to control access to certain features, blocking them if the user hasn't interacted with the page.
For example, it can be used to ensure that controlled features in cross-origin frames don't run code on page load.
See [Features gated by user activation](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/User_activation) for more information.

The {{domxref("UserActivation.hasBeenActive")}} property can be used to programmatically check the current window's sticky activation state.

# Strict mode

JavaScript's **strict mode** is a way to _opt in_ to a restricted variant of JavaScript, thereby implicitly opting-out of "{{Glossary("Sloppy_mode", "sloppy mode")}}". Strict mode isn't just a subset: it _intentionally_ has different semantics from normal code.

Strict mode for an entire script is invoked by including the statement `"use strict";` before any other statements.

# String

In any computer programming language, a string is a sequence of {{Glossary("character","characters")}} used to represent text.

In {{Glossary("JavaScript")}}, a String is one of the {{Glossary("Primitive", "primitive values")}} and the {{jsxref("String")}} object is a {{Glossary("wrapper")}} around a String primitive.

# Style origin

In {{Glossary("CSS")}}, there are three categories of sources for style changes. These categories are called **style origins**. They are the **user agent origin**, **user origin**, and the **author origin**.

- User-agent origin
  - : The user agent origin is the style origin comprised of the default styles used by the user's web browser. If no other styles are applied to content, the user agent origin's styles are used while rendering elements.
- User origin
  - : The user origin is the style origin containing any CSS that the user of the web browser has added. These may be from adding styles using a developer tool or from a browser extension that automatically applies custom styles to content, such as [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) or [Stylish](https://userstyles.org/).
- Author origin
  - : The author origin is the style origin which contains all of the styles which are part of the document, whether embedded within the {{Glossary("HTML")}} or loaded from an external stylesheet file.

The style origins are used to determine where to stop rolling back (or backtracking through) the cascade of styles that have been applied to an element when removing styles, such as when using the {{cssxref("unset")}} or {{cssxref("revert")}} keywords.

## See also

- [CSS cascading and inheritance: Cascading Origins](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-cascade-4/#cascading-origins)
# Stylesheet

A **stylesheet** is a set of CSS rules used to control the layout and design of a webpage or document. _Internal_ stylesheets are placed inside a {{htmlelement("style")}} element inside the {{htmlelement("head")}} of a web document, and _external_ stylesheets are placed inside a separate `.css` file, which is applied to a document by referencing the file inside a {{htmlelement("link")}} element in the document's head.

External stylesheets are generally preferred because they allow you to control the styling of multiple pages from a single place, rather than having to repeat the CSS across each page.

## See also

- [CSS Styling basics](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics)
- Stylesheets on [Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_sheet_(web_development)>)
# Submit button

A **submit button** is an {{Glossary("element")}} in HTML that can be used to submit a {{HTMLElement("form")}}. The native submit button elements are:

- {{HtmlElement("button")}} (its default `type` is `"submit"`)
- `{{HtmlElement('input/submit', '&lt;input type="submit"&gt;')}}`
- `{{HtmlElement('input/image', '&lt;input type="image"&gt;')}}`

In addition to submitting a form, a submit button can affect the form's behavior and what data is sent.

## Overriding the form's behavior

Submit buttons can override the form's submission behavior through various attributes:

- `{{HtmlElement("button#formaction", "formaction")}}`: Override the [`action`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#action) attribute of the form.
- `{{HtmlElement("button#formenctype", "formenctype")}}`: Override the [`enctype`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#enctype) attribute of the form.
- `{{HtmlElement("button#formmethod", "formmethod")}}`: Override the [`method`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#method) attribute of the form.
- `{{HtmlElement("button#formnovalidate", "formnovalidate")}}`: Override the [`novalidate`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#novalidate) attribute of the form.
- `{{HtmlElement("button#formtarget", "formtarget")}}`: Override the [`target`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#target) attribute of the form.

## Form data entries

If the submit button is a {{HtmlElement("button")}} or `{{HtmlElement('input/submit', '&lt;input type="submit"&gt;')}}` and has a `name` attribute, the form data set will include an entry for its `name` and `value`.

If the submit button is an `{{HtmlElement('input/image', '&lt;input type="image"&gt;')}}`, the form data set will include entries for the X and Y coordinates that the user clicked on (e.g., `x=100&y=200` or `buttonName.x=123&buttonName.y=234`).

# SVG

_Scalable Vector Graphics_ (**SVG**) is a 2D vector image format based on an {{Glossary("XML")}} syntax.

The {{Glossary("W3C")}} began work on SVG in the late 1990s, but SVG only became popular when {{Glossary("Microsoft Internet Explorer", "Internet Explorer")}} 9 came out with SVG support. All major {{Glossary("browser","browsers")}} now support SVG.

Based on an {{Glossary("XML")}} syntax, SVG can be styled with {{Glossary("CSS")}} and made interactive using {{Glossary("JavaScript")}}. HTML allows direct embedding of SVG {{Glossary("Tag","tags")}} in an {{Glossary("HTML")}} document.

As a [vector image format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics), SVG graphics can scale infinitely, making them invaluable in {{Glossary("responsive web design", "responsive design")}}, since you can create interface elements and graphics that scale to any screen size. SVG also provides a useful set of tools, such as clipping, masking, filters, and animations.

# SVN

Apache Subversion (**SVN**) is a free source control management ({{Glossary("SCM")}}) system. It allows developers to keep a history of text and code modifications. Although SVN can also handle binary files, we do not recommend that you use it for such files.

# Symbol

A **symbol** is a data type that represents unique, unforgeable identifiers. They are sometimes called _atoms_.

Because a symbol is unique and unforgeable, you can only read a property value associated with a symbol if you have a reference to the original identifier.

In JavaScript, `symbol` is one of the {{Glossary("primitive", "primitive types")}} and can be created using the [`Symbol()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol) factory method that returns a different symbol each time. They can be used as keys for objects which can never accidentally collide with other properties.

JavaScript also defines two other categories of symbols: well-known symbols and registered symbols. Read the {{jsxref("Symbol")}} reference for more information.

# Symmetric-key cryptography

Symmetric-key cryptography is a term used for cryptographic algorithms that use the same key for encryption and for decryption. The key is usually called a "symmetric key" or a "secret key".

This is usually contrasted with {{Glossary("public-key cryptography")}}, in which keys are generated in pairs and the transformation made by one key can only be reversed using the other key.

Symmetric-key algorithms should be secure when used properly and are highly efficient, so they can be used to encrypt large amounts of data without having a negative effect on performance.

Most symmetric-key algorithms currently in use are block {{Glossary("Cipher", "ciphers")}}: this means that they encrypt data one block at a time. The size of each block is fixed and determined by the algorithm: for example AES uses 16-byte blocks. Block ciphers are always used with a _{{Glossary("Block cipher mode of operation", "mode")}}_, which specifies how to securely encrypt messages that are longer than the block size. For example, AES is a cipher, while CTR, CBC, and GCM are all modes. Using an inappropriate mode, or using a mode incorrectly, can completely undermine the security provided by the underlying cipher.

# Synchronous

**Synchronous** refers to real-time communication where each party receives (and if necessary, processes and replies to) messages instantly (or as near to instantly as possible).

A human example is the telephone — during a telephone call you tend to respond to another person immediately.

Many programming commands are also synchronous — for example when you type in a calculation, the environment will return the result to you instantly, unless you program it not to.

# Syntax error

An {{Glossary("exception")}} caused by the incorrect use of a pre-defined {{Glossary("syntax")}}. Syntax errors are detected while compiling or parsing source code.

For example, if you leave off a closing brace (`}`) when defining a {{Glossary("JavaScript")}} function, you trigger a syntax error. Browser development tools display {{Glossary("JavaScript")}} and {{Glossary("CSS")}} syntax errors in the console.

# Syntax

Syntax specifies the required combination and sequence of {{Glossary("character","characters")}} making up correctly structured code. Syntax generally includes grammar and the rules that apply to writing it, such as indentation requirements in Python.

Syntax varies from language to language (e.g., syntax is different in {{Glossary("HTML")}} and {{Glossary("JavaScript")}}). Although languages can share few similarities in terms of their syntaxes for example "operand operator operand" rule in JavaScript and Python. This does not mean the two languages share similarities with syntax.

Syntax applies both to programming languages (commands to the computer) and markup languages (document structure information) alike.

Syntax only governs ordering and structure; the instructions must also be _meaningful_, which is the province of {{Glossary("semantics")}}.

Code must have correct syntax in order to {{Glossary("compile")}} correctly, otherwise a {{Glossary("syntax error")}} occurs. Even small errors, like a missing parenthesis, can stop source code from compiling successfully.

Frameworks are said to have a "clean" syntax if they produce simple, readable, concise results. If a codebase uses "a lot of syntax", it requires more characters to achieve the same functionality.

# Synthetic monitoring

**Synthetic monitoring** involves monitoring the performance of a page in a 'laboratory' environment, typically with automation tooling in an environment that is as consistent as possible.

With a consistent baseline, synthetic monitoring is good for measuring the effects of code changes on performance. However, it doesn't necessarily reflect what users are experiencing.

Synthetic Monitoring involves deploying scripts to simulate the path an end-user might take through a web application, reporting back the performance of the simulator experiences. Examples of popular synthetic monitoring tools include [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/) and [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/). The traffic measured is not of your actual users, but rather synthetically generated traffic collecting data on page performance.

Unlike {{Glossary("Real User Monitoring", "RUM")}}, synthetic monitoring provides a narrow view of performance that doesn't account for user differences, making it useful in getting basic data about an application's performance and spot-checking performance in development environments. Combined with other tools, such as network throttling, can provide excellent insight into potential problem areas.

# Table grid box

The **table grid box** is a block level box which contains all of the table internal boxes, excluding the caption. The box which includes the caption is referred to as the {{Glossary("table wrapper box")}}.
# Table wrapper box

The **Table Wrapper Box** is the box generated around {{Glossary("table grid box", "table grid boxes")}} which accounts for the space needed for any caption displayed for the table. This box will become the containing block for absolutely positioned items where the table is the containing block.
# Tag

In {{Glossary("HTML")}}, a **tag** is used for creating an {{Glossary("element")}}.

The name of an HTML element is the name that appears at the beginning of the element's start tag and at the end of the element's end tag (if the element has an end tag). For example, the `p` in the `<p>` start tag and `</p>` end tag is the name of the HTML paragraph element. Note that an element name in an end tag is preceded by a slash character: `</p>`, and that for {{glossary("void element", "void elements")}}, the end tag is neither required nor allowed.

# TCP handshake

{{glossary('TCP','TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)')}} uses a **three-way handshake** (aka TCP-handshake, three message handshake, and/or SYN-SYN-ACK) to set up a TCP/IP connection over an IP based network. Similarly, a **four-way handshake** is used to terminate the connection.

The three messages transmitted by TCP to negotiate and start a TCP session are nicknamed SYN, _SYN-ACK_, and ACK for **SYN**chronize, **SYN**chronize-**ACK**nowledgement, and **ACK**nowledge respectively. The three message mechanism is designed so that two computers that want to pass information back and forth to each other can negotiate the parameters of the connection before transmitting data such as HTTP browser requests.

1. The initiator, generally the browser, sends a TCP SYNchronize packet to the other host, generally the server.
2. The server receives the SYN and sends back a SYNchronize-ACKnowledgement.
3. The initiator receives the server's SYN-ACK and sends an ACKnowledge. The server receives ACK and the TCP socket connection is established.

This handshake step happens after a {{glossary('DNS', 'DNS lookup')}} and before the {{glossary('TLS')}} handshake, when creating a secure connection. The connection can be terminated independently by each side of the connection via a four-way handshake, where a pair of FIN (finish) and ACK messages are sent and received independently by each side.

1. The initiator sends a FIN packet to the other host.
2. The other host sends an ACK packet back to the initiator.
3. Now, the connection is half-closed, and the other host can still send data. (For example, the server can finish off sending data to the client when the client has closed its connection to the server.)
4. The other host sends a FIN packet to the initiator.
5. The initiator sends an ACK packet back to the other host.

# TCP

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** is an important network {{Glossary("protocol")}} that lets two hosts connect and exchange data streams. TCP guarantees the delivery of data and packets in the same order as they were sent. Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, who were DARPA scientists at the time, designed TCP in the 1970s.

TCP's role is to ensure the packets are reliably delivered, and error-free. TCP implements [congestion control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control), which means the initial requests start small, increasing in size to the levels of bandwidth the computers, servers, and network can support.

# TCP slow start

{{glossary('TCP')}} slow start is an algorithm that helps discover the available network bandwidth for packet transfer, and balance transmission speed according to the network's capabilities.
The mechanism rapidly increases the volume of information sent from a very low level to a threshold level. If congestion is detected the threshold is reset to a much reduced level and the slow start process starts again.
This prevents congestion when a network's capabilities are unknown or exceeded — at the beginning of a connection, after a period of inactivity, or after detecting congestion — without itself causing congestion.

Network congestion occurs when more data is sent than the network is able to transfer between nodes at any given time.
When a network is congested, machines on the network experience degraded quality of service, including slow data transfers and dropped packets.

The slow start algorithm is a major part of TCP congestion control, as it ensures that new connections progressively increase data rates and that those rates don't overwhelm other nodes.

# Texel

In 3D graphics, a **texel** is a single pixel within a texture. _Textures_ are images presented on a polygon's surface within a 3D rendered image. A texture is characterized by a collection of texels, similar to how an image is characterized by a collection of pixels.

A pixel in a raster image file is a series of bits containing color data, and sometimes opacity data, which maps to display pixels on an output device such as a computer monitor. When a pixel belongs to an image used as a texture resource, it is called a 'texture pixel' or shortened to 'texel'. Instead of mapping directly to screen pixels, a texel's data is mapped to a location in the coordinate space of the 3D object being modeled. Textures can be used to convey color and other surface qualities such as depth and reflectivity. Multiple textures may be layered to create complex surface overlays.

The process of mapping the appropriate texels to their corresponding points on a polygon is called **texture mapping**. Texture mapping is a stage of the process of rendering a 3D image for display. When the source texel grid and destination pixel grid do not align, further **texture filtering** is applied to smooth the resultant texture-mapped pixels (texture _magnification_ or _minification_). The final output of the rendering process is a flattened 2D projection of the 3D model, where the texture has been 'wrapped' around the model.

During the render pipeline, texture mapping is typically done prior to lighting the scene; however, in WebGL, lighting is performed as part of the texture mapping process.

# Thread

Thread in computer science is the execution of running multiple tasks or programs at the same time. Each unit capable of executing code is called a **thread**.

The **{{Glossary("main thread")}}** is the one used by the browser to handle user events, render and paint the display, and to run the majority of the code that comprises a typical web page or app. Because these things are all happening in one thread, a slow website or app script slows down the entire browser; worse, if a site or app script enters an infinite loop, the entire browser will hang. This results in a frustrating, sluggish (or worse) user experience.

Modern {{Glossary("JavaScript")}} offers ways to create additional threads, each executing independently while possibly communicating between one another. This is done using technologies such as [web workers](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API), which can be used to spin off a sub-program that runs concurrently with the main thread in a thread of its own. This allows slow, complex, or long-running tasks to be executed independently of the main thread, preserving the overall performance of the site or app—as well as that of the browser overall.
Threading also allows web applications to take advantage of modern multi-core processors: enabling even better performance than multi-threaded applications running on a single core.

A special type of worker, called a **[service worker](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API)**, can be created which can be left behind by a site—with the user's permission—to run even when the user isn't currently using that site. This is used to create sites capable of notifying the user when things happen while they're not actively engaged with a site. Such as notifying a user they have received new email even though they're not currently logged into their mail service.

Overall it can be observed these threads within our operating system are extremely helpful. They help minimize the context switching time, enables more efficient communication and allows further use of the multiprocessor architecture.

# Throttle

**Throttling** originally meant slowing down the rate of fluid flow using an obstruction. In the context of programming, it refers to slowing down a process such that an operation can only be performed at a certain rate.

Throttling is very similar to {{glossary("debounce", "debouncing")}}. The key difference is that when invocations happen continuously, throttling ensures that the operation is still performed at a certain maximum rate, while debouncing waits indefinitely until the invocations stop for a certain amount of time.

A typical use case of throttling is when synchronizing with another constantly-updating state. Consider a function `onScrolled`, which listens for the [`scroll`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/scroll_event) event. The `scroll` event may fire as often as every pixel scrolled, so the function will be called in very short intervals. If `onScrolled` is computationally expensive, earlier invocations might block later invocations from happening on time, or block other things from executing in the meantime, leading to a noticeable {{glossary("jank")}}. In this case, we can throttle `onScrolled`, such that it can only be called at most once every 10 milliseconds:

1. The first call to `onScrolled` is known as the _leading edge_.
2. For every next call to `onScrolled`, if it is within 10 milliseconds from the first call, it is in the same "batch" as the first call.
3. After 10 milliseconds have elapsed from the first call to `onScrolled`, we have reached the _trailing edge_.

Usually, `onScrolled` is executed once on the leading edge only, although sometimes it might be executed on the trailing edge, or even both edges, depending on the specific use case. If executed on both edges, the throttling implementation usually also ensures that the next leading edge invocation doesn't fire at least 10 milliseconds after the previous trailing edge.

Via throttling, the effect of `onScrolled` is still continuously updated and applied — for example, if it moves another DOM element based on the document's scroll position, that DOM element is still continuously moved while the page is scrolling — but it isn't executed more often than necessary.

{{glossary("Network throttling")}} means to simulate a slower network connection by only allowing a certain amount of data to be transferred at a time. _Throttling a timer_ means to coarsen the timer's precision such that when reading the timer (such as {{jsxref("Date.now()")}}) continuously, the timer's value only changes at a certain maximum rate. Both are specific applications of the general concept of throttling.

# Time to First Byte (TTFB)

**Time to First Byte** (**TTFB**) refers to the time between the browser requesting a page and when it receives the first byte of information from the server. This time includes {{Glossary("DNS")}} lookup and establishing the connection using a {{Glossary("TCP")}} handshake and {{Glossary("TLS")}} handshake if the request is made over {{Glossary("HTTPS")}}.

TTFB is the time it takes between the start of the request and the start of the response, in milliseconds. This can be measured using the {{domxref("PerformanceResourceTiming.responseStart", "responseStart")}} attribute of {{domxref("PerformanceNavigationTiming")}}:

```js
const ttfb = performance.getEntriesByType("navigation")[0].responseStart;
```

> [!NOTE]
> For sites using {{HTTPStatus("103", "103 Early Hints")}}, TTFB is typically the _first bytes_ (after any redirects) — and so, the 103 interim response. Site owners wishing to measure the time until the final response should use {{domxref("PerformanceResourceTiming.finalResponseHeadersStart", "finalResponseHeadersStart")}}, where supported.

# Time to Interactive (TTI)

**Time to Interactive** (**TTI**) is a non-standardized web performance 'progress' metric defined as the point in time when the last [Long Task](/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceLongTaskTiming) finished and was followed by 5 seconds of network and main thread inactivity.

TTI, proposed by the Web Incubator Community Group in 2018, was intended to provide a metric that describes when a page or application contains useful content and the main thread is idle and free to respond to user interactions, including having event handlers registered.

#### Caveat

TTI is derived by leveraging information from the [Long Task API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceLongTaskTiming). Although available in some performance monitoring tools, TTI is not a part of any official web specification.

# TLD

A TLD (_top-level domain_) is the most generic {{Glossary("domain")}} in the Internet's hierarchical {{Glossary("DNS")}} (domain name system). A TLD is the final component of a {{Glossary("domain name")}}, for example, "org" in `developer.mozilla.org`.

{{Glossary("ICANN")}} (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) designates organizations to manage each TLD. Depending on how strict an administrating organization might be, TLD often serves as a clue to the purpose, ownership, or nationality of a website.

Consider an example Internet address: `https://developer.mozilla.org`
Here org is the TLD; mozilla.org is the second-level domain name; and developer is a subdomain name. All together, these constitute a fully-qualified domain name; the addition of https\:// makes this a complete URL.

{{Glossary("IANA")}} today distinguishes the following groups of top-level domains:

- country-code top-level domains (ccTLD)
  - : Two-character domains established for countries or territories. Example: _.us_ for United States.
- internationalized country code top-level domains (IDN ccTLD)
  - : ccTLDs in non-Latin character sets (e.g., Arabic or Chinese).
- generic top-level domains (gTLD)
  - : Top-level domains with three or more characters.
- unsponsored top-level domains
  - : Domains that operate directly under policies established by ICANN processes for the global Internet community, for example "com" and "edu".
- sponsored top-level domains (sTLD)
  - : These domains are proposed and sponsored by private organizations that decide whether an applicant is eligible to use the TLD, based on community theme concepts.
- infrastructure top-level domain
  - : This group consists of one domain, the {{Glossary("ARPA", "Address and Routing Parameter Area")}} (ARPA).

# Transport Layer Security (TLS)

**Transport Layer Security (TLS)**, formerly known as {{Glossary("SSL", "Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)")}}, is a {{Glossary("protocol")}} used by applications to communicate securely across a network, preventing tampering with and eavesdropping on email, web browsing, messaging, and other protocols. Both TLS and SSL are client / server protocols that ensure communication privacy by using cryptographic protocols to provide security over a network. When a server and client communicate using TLS, it ensures that no third party can eavesdrop or tamper with any message.

All modern browsers support the TLS protocol, requiring the server to provide a valid {{Glossary("Digital certificate", "digital certificate")}} confirming its identity in order to establish a secure connection. It is possible for both the client and server to mutually authenticate each other, if both parties provide their own individual digital certificates.

> [!NOTE]
> All major browsers began removing support for TLS 1.0 and 1.1 in early 2020; you'll need to make sure your web server supports TLS 1.2 or 1.3 going forward. From version 74 onwards, Firefox will return a [Secure Connection Failed](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/secure-connection-failed-firefox-did-not-connect) error when connecting to servers using the older TLS versions ([Firefox bug 1606734](https://bugzil.la/1606734)).

# TOFU

**Trust On First Use** **(TOFU**) is a security model in which a client needs to create a trust relationship with an unknown server. To do that, clients will look for identifiers (for example public keys) stored locally. If an identifier is found, the client can establish the connection. If no identifier is found, the client can prompt the user to determine if the client should trust the identifier.

TOFU is used in the SSH protocol, in {{HTTPHeader("Strict-Transport-Security")}} ({{Glossary("HSTS")}}) where a browser will obey the redirection rule.

- Wikipedia: [TOFU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_on_first_use)
# Top layer

The **top layer** is a specific layer that spans the entire width and height of the viewport and sits on top of all other layers displayed in a web document. It is created by the browser to contain elements that should appear on top of all other content on the page.

Elements placed in the top layer generate a new [stacking context](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_positioned_layout/Stacking_context), as do their corresponding {{cssxref("::backdrop")}} pseudo-elements.

Elements that will appear in the top layer include:

- Fullscreen elements, i.e., elements that have been caused to display in fullscreen mode by a successful {{domxref("Element.requestFullscreen()")}} call.
- {{htmlelement("dialog")}} elements displayed as a modal via a successful {{domxref("HTMLDialogElement.showModal()")}} call.
- Popover elements shown via a successful {{domxref("HTMLElement.showPopover()")}} call.

Some browsers, such as Chrome, show elements placed in the top layer inside a special DOM tree entry. For example:

![An element in the top layer, as shown in the chrome devtools](top_layer_devtools.png)

Note that the top layer is an internal browser concept and cannot be directly manipulated from code. You can target elements placed in the top layer using CSS and JavaScript, but you cannot target the top layer itself.

# Transient activation

**Transient activation** (or "transient user activation") is a window state that indicates a user has recently directly and meaningfully interacted with the window.

The state is enabled following any user interaction, when the window has focus, that results in the browser generating one or more of the following:

- A `mousedown` or `pointerdown` event for a mouse.
- A `pointerup` event for any other kind of pointer.
- A `touchend` event.
- A `keydown` event, other than for the escape or browser shortcut keys.

The window is not user-activated by events that aren't necessarily caused by intentional interaction with the window, such as mouse move events or `wheel` events.

Transient activation expires after a timeout (if not renewed by further interaction), and may also be consumed/deactivated after using some gated features (such as {{domxref("Window.open()")}}).

Transient activation is commonly used as a mechanism for ensuring that a web API can only function if triggered by user interaction.
For example, scripts cannot arbitrarily launch a popup that requires _transient activation_ ⁠— it must be triggered from a UI element's event handler.
See [Features gated by user activation](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/User_activation) for information about APIs that require _transient activation_.

The {{domxref("UserActivation.isActive")}} property can be used to programmatically check the current window's transient activation state.

# Tree shaking

**Tree shaking** is a term commonly used within a JavaScript context to describe the removal of dead code.

It relies on the [import](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) and [export](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export) statements to detect if code modules are exported and imported for use between JavaScript files.

In modern JavaScript applications, we use module bundlers (e.g., [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup)) to automatically remove dead code when bundling multiple JavaScript files into single files. This is important for preparing code that is production ready, for example with clean structures and minimal file size.

# Trident

**Trident** (or _MSHTML_) was the proprietary {{Glossary("Engine/Rendering", "rendering engine")}} that powered {{Glossary("Microsoft Internet Explorer", "Internet Explorer")}}. A {{Glossary("fork")}} called _EdgeHTML_ replaced Trident in Internet Explorer's successor, {{Glossary("Microsoft Edge", "Edge")}} (later referred to as "Microsoft Edge Legacy").

Trident is used in Microsoft Edge when 'IE mode' is on, a feature that allows Edge to render web pages using Trident for compatibility with legacy websites. Trident will only receive security updates until 2029 to support usage in IE mode.

# Truthy

In {{Glossary("JavaScript")}}, a **truthy** value is a value that is considered `true` when encountered in a {{Glossary("Boolean")}} context. All values are truthy unless they are defined as {{Glossary("Falsy", "falsy")}}. That is, all values are _truthy_ except `false`, `0`, `-0`, `0n`, `""`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`, and {{domxref("document.all")}}.

{{Glossary("JavaScript")}} uses {{Glossary("Type_Coercion", "type coercion")}} in Boolean contexts.

Examples of _truthy_ values in JavaScript (which will be coerced to `true` in boolean contexts, and thus execute the `if` block):

```js
if (true);
if ({});
if ([]);
if (42);
if ("0");
if ("false");
if (new Date());
if (-42);
if (12n);
if (3.14);
if (-3.14);
if (Infinity);
if (-Infinity);
```

### The logical AND operator, &&

If the first operand is truthy, the [logical AND operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_AND) returns the second operand:

```js
true && "dog";
// returns "dog"

[] && "dog";
// returns "dog"
```

# TTL

Time To Live (TTL) can refer to either the lifetime of a packet in a network, or the expiry time of cached data.

## Networking

In networking, the TTL, embedded in the packet, is a usually defined as a number of hops or as an expiration timestamp after which the packet is dropped. It provides a way to avoid network congestion, but releasing packets after they roamed the network too long.

## Caching

In the context of caching, TTL (as an unsigned 32-bit integer) being a part of the {{Glossary("Response header", "HTTP response header")}} or the {{Glossary("DNS")}} query, indicates the amount of time in seconds during which the resource can be cached by the requester.

# TURN

**TURN** (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) is a {{Glossary('protocol')}} enabling a computer to receive and send data from behind a {{glossary("NAT", "Network Address Translator")}} (NAT) or firewall.

# Type coercion

Type coercion is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another (such as strings to numbers). _{{Glossary("Type conversion")}}_ is similar to _type coercion_ because they both convert values from one data type to another with one key difference — _type coercion_ is implicit whereas _type conversion_ can be either implicit _or_ explicit.

## Examples

```js
const value1 = "5";
const value2 = 9;
let sum = value1 + value2;

console.log(sum);
```

In the above example, JavaScript has _coerced_ the `9` from a number into a string and then concatenated the two values together, resulting in a string of `59`. JavaScript had a choice between a string or a number and decided to use a string.

The compiler could have coerced the `5` into a number and returned a sum of `14`, but it did not. To return this result, you'd have to explicitly convert the `5` to a number using the {{jsxref("Global_Objects/Number", "Number()")}} method:

```js
sum = Number(value1) + value2;
```

# Type conversion

Type conversion (or typecasting) means transfer of data from one data type to another. _Implicit conversion_ happens when the compiler (for compiled languages) or runtime (for script languages like {{glossary("JavaScript")}}) automatically converts data types. The source code can also _explicitly_ require a conversion to take place.

For example, given the expression `"foo" + 1`, the {{glossary("Number")}} `1` is implicitly converted into a {{glossary("String")}} and the expression returns `"foo1"`. Given the instruction `Number("0x11")`, the string `"0x11"` is explicitly converted to the number `17`.

# Type

**Type** is a characteristic of a {{glossary("value")}} affecting what kind of data it can store, and the structure that the data will adhere to. For example, a {{Glossary("boolean")}} [Data Type](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Data_structures) can hold only a `true` or `false` value at any given time, whereas a {{Glossary("string")}} has the ability to hold a string or a sequence of characters, a {{Glossary("number")}} can hold numerical values of any kind, and so on.

A value's data type also affects the operations that are valid on that value. For example, a value of type number can be multiplied by another number, but not by a string - even if that string contains _only_ a number, such as the string "2".

Types also provides us with useful knowledge about the comparison between different values. Comparison between structured types is not always an easy assumption, as even if the previous data structure is the same, there could be inherited structures inside of the [Prototype Chain](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain).

If you are unsure of the type of a value, you can use the [`typeof`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof) operator.

# TypeScript

TypeScript is a programming language that adds {{glossary("static_typing", "static type checking")}} to JavaScript.

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning that everything available in JavaScript is also available in TypeScript, and that every JavaScript program is a syntactically legal TypeScript program. Also, the runtime behavior of TypeScript and JavaScript is identical.

However, TypeScript adds compile time type checking, implementing rules about how different types can be used and combined. This catches a wide variety of programming errors that in JavaScript are only encountered at runtime.

Some typing rules are inferred from JavaScript. For example, in the code below, TypeScript infers that `myVariable` is a string, and will not allow it to be reassigned to a different type:

```js
let myVariable = "Hello World";
myVariable = 1;
// Error:
// Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.
```

TypeScript also enables the programmer to annotate their code, to indicate, for example, the types of parameters to a function or the properties of an object:

```ts
function add(left: number, right: number): number {
  return left + right;
}

add("hello", "world");
// Error:
// Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
```

After compilation, type annotations are removed, making the compiled output just JavaScript, meaning it can be executed in any JavaScript runtime.

# UAAG

_User Agent {{glossary("Accessibility")}} Guidelines_ (**UAAG**) is a recommendation published by the {{Glossary("WAI","Web Accessibility Initiative")}} group at the {{Glossary("W3C")}}, explaining how to make user agents accessible to people with disabilities. User agents include browsers, browser extensions, media players, readers and other applications that render web content. Some accessibility needs are better met in the browser than in the web content, such as text customization, preferences, and user interface accessibility.

# UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

**UDP** (User Datagram Protocol) is a long standing {{glossary("protocol")}} used together with {{glossary("IPv6","IP")}} for sending data when transmission speed and efficiency matter more than security and reliability.

UDP uses a simple [connectionless communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionless_communication) model with a minimum of protocol mechanism. UDP provides [checksums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum) for data integrity, and [port numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_numbers) for addressing different functions at the source and destination of the datagram. It has no [handshaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshaking) dialogues, and thus exposes the user's program to any [unreliability](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(computer_networking)>) of the underlying network; There is no guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection. If error-correction facilities are needed at the network interface level, an application may use the [Transmission Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) (TCP) or [Stream Control Transmission Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_Control_Transmission_Protocol) (SCTP) which are designed for this purpose.

UDP is suitable for purposes where error checking and correction are either not necessary or are performed in the application; UDP avoids the overhead of such processing in the [protocol stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_stack). Time-sensitive applications often use UDP because dropping packets is preferable to waiting for packets delayed due to [retransmission](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retransmission_(data_networks)>), which may not be an option in a [real-time system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_system).

# UI

**User Interface** (UI) is anything that facilitates the interaction between a user and a machine. In the world of computers, it can be anything from a keyboard, a joystick, a screen or a program.

# Unicode

Unicode is a standard {{Glossary("Character set","character set")}} that numbers and defines {{Glossary("Character","characters")}} from the world's different languages, writing systems, and symbols.

By assigning each character a number, programmers can create {{Glossary("Character encoding","character encodings")}}, to let computers store, process, and transmit any combination of languages in the same file or program.

Before Unicode, it was difficult and error-prone to mix languages in the same data. For example, one character set would store Japanese characters, and another would store the Arabic alphabet. If it was not clearly marked which parts of the data were in which character set, other programs and computers would display the text incorrectly, or damage it during processing. If you've ever seen text where characters like curly quotes (&ldquo;&rdquo;) were replaced with gibberish like `Ã‚Â£`, then you've seen this problem, known as [Mojibake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake).

The most common Unicode character encoding on the Web is {{Glossary("UTF-8")}}. Other encodings exist, like {{glossary("UTF-16")}} or the obsolete UCS-2, but UTF-8 is recommended.

# Unix time

Unix time is a method to represent a timestamp, and is usually defined as the number of seconds since the beginning of the Unix epoch, which is January 1st, 1970, at midnight (UTC). Leap seconds are ignored.

On the web platform, Unix time is used for timestamps, and is given as the number of milliseconds since the beginning of the Unix epoch.

# URI

A **URI** _(Uniform Resource Identifier)_ is a string that refers to a resource.

The most common are {{Glossary("URL","URLs")}}, which identify the resource by giving its location on the Web. {{Glossary("URN","URNs")}}, by contrast, refer to a resource by a name, in a given namespace, such as the ISBN of a book.

# URL

**Uniform Resource Locator** (**URL**) is a text string that specifies where a resource (such as a web page, image, or video) can be found on the Internet.

In the context of {{Glossary("HTTP")}}, URLs are called "Web address" or "link". Your {{glossary("browser")}} displays URLs in its address bar, for example: `https://developer.mozilla.org`. Some browsers display only the part of a URL after the "//", that is, the {{Glossary("Domain name")}}.

URLs can also be used for file transfer ({{Glossary("FTP")}}), emails ({{Glossary("SMTP")}}), and other applications.

# User agent

A user agent is a computer program representing a person, for example, a {{Glossary("Browser","browser")}} in a {{Glossary("World Wide Web", "Web")}} context.

Besides a browser, a user agent could be a bot scraping webpages, a download manager, or another app accessing the Web. Along with each request they make to the server, browsers include a self-identifying {{HTTPHeader("User-Agent")}} {{Glossary("HTTP")}} header called a user agent (UA) string. This string often identifies the browser, its version number, and its host operating system.

Spam bots, download managers, and some browsers often send a fake UA string to announce themselves as a different client. This is known as _user agent spoofing_.

The user agent string can be accessed with {{Glossary("JavaScript")}} on the client side using the {{domxref("navigator.userAgent")}} property.

A typical user agent string looks like this: `"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:124.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/124.0"`.

# UTF-16

UTF-16 is a {{glossary("character encoding")}} standard for {{glossary("Unicode")}}. It encodes each Unicode {{glossary("code point")}} using either one or two {{glossary("code unit", "code units")}}. Each code unit is a 16-bit value.

Code points whose values are less than 2<sup>16</sup> are encoded as a single code unit that is numerically equal to the code point's value. These code points comprise the [Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(Unicode)#Basic_Multilingual_Plane>), and include the most common characters, including Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, and many East Asian characters.

For example, the Latin character "A" is assigned the code point `U+0041` in Unicode, and this is represented in UTF-16 as the single code unit `41`.

Code points whose values are greater than 2<sup>16</sup> are encoded using a pair of code units, which is called a _surrogate pair_. The values used for surrogate pairs are not used for Unicode code points, so as to avoid ambiguity.

For example, the emoji character "🦊" (Fox Face) is assigned the code point `U+1F98A` in Unicode, and this is represented in UTF-16 as the surrogate pair `d83e dd8a`.

## UTF-16 in JavaScript

Strings in JavaScript are represented using UTF-16, and many {{jsxref("String")}} APIs operate on code units, not code points. For example, {{jsxref("String.length")}} returns `2` for a string containing a single Unicode character which is not in the BMP:

```js
const string = "🦊"; // U+1F98A
console.log(string.length); // 2
```

The {{jsxref("String.charCodeAt()")}} method returns the code unit at the given index, and the {{jsxref("String.codePointAt()")}} method returns the code point at the given index:

```js
const string = "🦊"; // U+1F98A

console.log(string.charCodeAt(0).toString(16)); // d83e
console.log(string.charCodeAt(1).toString(16)); // dd8a

console.log(string.codePointAt(0).toString(16)); // 1f98a
```

See [UTF-16 characters, Unicode code points, and grapheme clusters](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#utf-16_characters_unicode_code_points_and_grapheme_clusters) to learn more about working with UTF-16 strings in JavaScript.

## UTF-16 and UTF-8

{{glossary("UTF-8")}} is an alternative encoding for Unicode, which uses one to four bytes for each Unicode code point. UTF-8 is a much more common encoding for documents on the Web than UTF-16.

## UTF-16 and UCS-2

UCS-2 is an obsolete encoding for Unicode. It is the same as UTF-16, except it does not support surrogate pairs, so is not able to encode code points outside the BMP.

# UTF-8

UTF-8 (UCS Transformation Format 8) is the World Wide Web's most common {{Glossary("Character encoding", "character encoding")}}. Each character is represented by one to four bytes. UTF-8 is backward-compatible with {{Glossary("ASCII")}} and can represent any standard Unicode character.

The first 128 UTF-8 characters precisely match the first 128 ASCII characters (numbered 0-127), meaning that existing ASCII text is already valid UTF-8. All other characters use two to four bytes. Each byte has some bits reserved for encoding purposes. Since non-ASCII characters require more than one byte for storage, they run the risk of being corrupted if the bytes are separated and not recombined.

# UUID

A **Universally Unique Identifier** (**UUID**) is a label used to uniquely identify a resource among all other resources of that type.

Computer systems generate UUIDs locally using very large random numbers.
In theory the IDs may not be globally unique, but the probability of duplicates is vanishingly small.
If systems really need absolutely unique IDs then these might be allocated by a central authority.

UUIDs are 128-bit values that are canonically represented as a 36-character string in the format `123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000` (5 hex strings separated by hyphens).
There are a number of versions that differ slightly in the way they are calculated; for example, the inclusion of temporal information.

The formal definition can be found in: [RFC4122: A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122).

# UX

**UX** is an acronym that stands for User eXperience. It is the study of the interaction between users and a system. Its goal is to make a system easy to interact with from the user's point of view.

The system can be any kind of product or application that an end user is meant to interact with. UX studies undertaken on a web page for example can demonstrate whether it is easy for users to understand the page, navigate to different areas, and complete common tasks, and where such processes could have less friction.

# Value

In the context of data or an object **{{Glossary("Wrapper", "wrapper")}}** around that data, the value is the **{{Glossary("Primitive","primitive value")}}** that the object wrapper contains. In the context of a **{{Glossary("Variable","variable")}}** or **{{Glossary("Property","property")}}**, the value can be either a primitive or an **{{Glossary("Object reference","object reference")}}**.

In the context of CSS property values, there are specified, computed, and actual values. The final value for every CSS property applied to every element and pseudo-element is the result of a four-step calculation: the value is determined through specification (the "[specified value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Value_processing#specified_value)", then resolved into a value that is used for inheritance (the "[computed value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Value_processing#computed_value)"), then converted into an absolute value if necessary (the "[used value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Value_processing#used_value)"), and finally transformed according to the limitations of the local environment (the "[actual value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Value_processing#actual_value)").

# Vendor prefix

Browser vendors used to add prefixes to experimental or nonstandard CSS properties and JavaScript APIs, so developers could experiment with new ideas. This, in theory, helped to prevent their experiments from being relied upon and then breaking web developers' code during the standardization process.

Web developers included prefixed features on production websites, despite their experimental nature. This made it more difficult for browser vendors to ensure compatibility while working on new features. Including prefixed features also harmed smaller browser vendors who ended up having to add other browsers' prefixes in order to render popular websites.

Now, experimental features in browsers are "put behind a flag". This allows developers to change browser configurations to test upcoming features. Browsers now add experimental features behind user-controlled flags or preferences. Flags can be added for smaller specifications enabling reaching a stable state much more quickly.

## CSS prefixes

The most common browser CSS prefixes you will see in older code bases include:

- `-webkit-` (Chrome, Safari, newer versions of Opera and Edge, almost all iOS browsers including Firefox for iOS; basically, any WebKit or Chromium-based browser)
- `-moz-` (Firefox)
- `-o-` (old pre-WebKit versions of Opera)
- `-ms-` (Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge, before Chromium)

Sample usage:

```css
-webkit-transition: all 4s ease;
-moz-transition: all 4s ease;
-ms-transition: all 4s ease;
-o-transition: all 4s ease;
transition: all 4s ease;
```

If you encounter the above code in a code base, you can safely remove all but the last line. All browsers support [transitions](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition#browser_compatibility) without vendor prefixes:

```css
transition: all 4s ease;
```

## API prefixes

Historically, browser vendors have also used prefixes for experimental APIs. If an entire interface was experimental, then the interface's name was prefixed (but not the properties or methods within). If an experimental property or method was added to a standardized interface, then the individual method or property was prefixed.

### Interface prefixes

Prefixes for interface names are upper-cased:

- `WebKit` (Chrome, Safari, newer versions of Opera and Edge, almost all iOS browsers (including Firefox for iOS); basically, any WebKit and Chromium-based browser)
- `Moz` (Firefox)
- `O` (Older, pre-WebKit, versions of Opera)
- `MS` (Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge, before Chromium)

### Property and method prefixes

The prefixes for properties and methods are lower-case:

- `webkit` (Chrome, Safari, newer versions of Opera and Edge, almost all iOS browsers (including Firefox for iOS); basically, any WebKit and Chromium-based browser)
- `moz` (Firefox)
- `o` (Old, pre-WebKit, versions of Opera)
- `ms` (Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge, before Chromium)

Sample usage:

```js
window.requestAnimationFrame =
  window.requestAnimationFrame ||
  window.mozRequestAnimationFrame ||
  window.webkitRequestAnimationFrame ||
  window.oRequestAnimationFrame ||
  window.msRequestAnimationFrame;
```

If you encounter the above code in a code base, you can safely remove all but the first line. All browsers support [`requestAnimationFrame`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestAnimationFrame#browser_compatibility) without vendor prefixes, and without `window`:

```js
requestAnimationFrame(callback);
```

# Viewport

In computer graphics, a **viewport** represents a polygonal (normally rectangular) area that is currently being viewed.

In web browser terms, it refers to the part of the document being viewed in the browser window (or on-screen, if the document is being viewed on a mobile browser or a desktop browser in full-screen mode). Content outside the viewport is not visible onscreen until scrolled into view.

The portion of the viewport that is currently visible is called the **{{Glossary("visual viewport")}}**. This can be smaller than the layout viewport, such as when the user has pinched-zoomed. The {{Glossary("layout viewport")}} remains the same, but the visual viewport became smaller.

The visual viewport of an {{htmlelement("iframe")}}, {{svgelement("svg")}}, or {{htmlelement("object")}} element is the size of the inner width and height of the respective element, rather than the parent document. For content rendered inside the element, the visual viewport and layout viewport are the same.

# Visual viewport

The portion of the {{Glossary("viewport")}} that is currently visible is called the **visual viewport**. This can be smaller than the {{Glossary("layout viewport")}}, for example when the user has pinch-zoomed. The visual viewport is the visual portion of a screen excluding on-screen keyboards, areas outside of a pinch-zoom area, and any other on-screen artifact that doesn't scale with the dimensions of a page.

# Void element

A **void element** is an {{Glossary("element")}} in HTML that **cannot** have any child nodes (i.e., nested elements or text nodes). Void elements only have a start tag; end tags must not be specified for void elements.

In HTML, a void element must not have an end tag. For example, `<input type="text"></input>` is invalid HTML. In contrast, SVG or MathML elements that cannot have any child nodes may use an end tag instead of XML self-closing-tag syntax in their start tag.

The [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/), [SVG](https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/), and [MathML](https://w3c.github.io/mathml/spec.html) specifications define very precisely what each element can contain. So, some combinations of tags have no semantic meaning.

Although there is no way to mark up a void element as having any children, child nodes can be added programmatically to the element in the DOM using JavaScript. But that is not a good practice, as the outcome will not be reliable.

The void elements in HTML are as follows:

- {{HTMLElement("area")}}
- {{HTMLElement("base")}}
- {{HTMLElement("br")}}
- {{HTMLElement("col")}}
- {{HTMLElement("embed")}}
- {{HTMLElement("hr")}}
- {{HTMLElement("img")}}
- {{HTMLElement("input")}}
- {{HTMLElement("link")}}
- {{HTMLElement("meta")}}
- {{HTMLElement("param")}} {{deprecated_inline}}
- {{HTMLElement("source")}}
- {{HTMLElement("track")}}
- {{HTMLElement("wbr")}}

## Self-closing tags

_Self-closing tags (`<tag />`) do not exist in HTML._

If a trailing `/` (slash) character is present in the start tag of an HTML element, HTML parsers ignore that slash character. This is especially important to remember for elements such as {{HTMLElement('script')}} or {{HTMLElement('ul')}} that do require a closing tag. In these cases, adding a trailing slash in the start tag does not close the element. Instead, the trailing slash is ignored, and the element is treated as open until an explicit closing tag is encountered or until the parser implicitly closes the element based on the HTML structure and parsing rules. For example, in the case of `<div/>Some text`, browsers interpret this as `<div>Some text</div>`, treating the slash as ignored and considering the div element to encapsulate the text that follows.

However, some code formatters add the trailing slash character to the start tags of void elements to make them XHTML-compatible and more readable. For example, some code formatters will convert `<input type="text">` to `<input type="text" />`.

Self-closing tags are required in void elements in {{Glossary("XML")}}, {{Glossary("XHTML")}}, and {{Glossary("SVG")}} (e.g., `<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="50" />`).

In SVG and MathML, elements that cannot have any child nodes are allowed to be marked as self-closing. In such cases, if an element's start tag is marked as self-closing, the element must not have an end tag.

> [!NOTE]
> If a trailing `/` (slash) character in a start tag is directly preceded by an unquoted attribute value — with no space between — the slash becomes a part of the attribute value rather than being discarded by the parser. For example, the markup `<img src=http://www.example.com/logo.svg/>` results in the `src` attribute having the value `http://www.example.com/logo.svg/` — which makes the URL wrong.

# VoIP

VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) is a technology used to transmit voice messages over IP (Internet Protocol) networks. Common VoIP packages include Skype, MSN Messenger, Yahoo and many more. Everything transferred through VoIP is digital. It is also known as IP telephony, or broadband telephony. The main reason for using VoIP technology is because of cost.

VoIP allows you to make a call directly from a computer, a special VoIP phone, or a traditional phone connected to a special adapter. A high speed internet connection is required for VoIP. Usually, telephone calls over the Internet do not incur further charges beyond what the user is paying for Internet access, much in the same way that the user doesn't pay for sending individual emails over the Internet.

# W3C

The _World Wide Web Consortium_ (W3C) is an international body that maintains {{Glossary("World Wide Web", "Web-related")}} rules and frameworks.

It consists of over 350 member-organizations that jointly develop Web standards, run outreach programs, and maintain an open forum for talking about the Web. The W3C coordinates companies in the industry to make sure they implement the same W3C standards.

Each standard passes through four stages of maturity: Working Draft (WD), Candidate Recommendation (CR), Proposed Recommendation (PR), and W3C Recommendation (REC).

# WAI

The **Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)** is an effort by the {{glossary("W3C")}} to develop standards and guidelines to help everyone building the web ensure and improve {{glossary("accessibility")}} for people with various challenges.

WAI develops guidelines and other technical reports through the same process as other parts of the W3C. WAI develops accessibility guidelines for web content ({{glossary("WCAG")}}), authoring tools ({{glossary("ATAG")}}), and user agents ({{glossary("UAAG")}}). WAI also develops the Accessible Rich Internet Applications ({{Glossary("ARIA")}}) suite of technologies to make Web content and Web applications more accessible to people with disabilities. It especially helps with dynamic content and advanced user interface controls developed with HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies.

# WCAG

_Web Content Accessibility Guidelines_ (**WCAG**) is a recommendation published by the {{Glossary("WAI","Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)")}} group at the {{Glossary("W3C")}}, outlining a set of guidelines for making content {{glossary("accessibility", "accessible")}} primarily for people with disabilities, but also for limited-resource devices and services, such as digital assistants.

WCAG 2 consists of 13 guidelines organized under 4 principles (perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust) and each guideline has testable success criteria.

WCAG 2 uses three levels of conformance:

- Priority 1: Web developers **must** satisfy these requirements, otherwise it will be impossible for one or more groups to access the Web content. Conformance to this level is described as A.
- Priority 2: Web developers **should** satisfy these requirements, otherwise some groups will find it difficult to access the Web content. Conformance to this level is described as AA or Double-A.
- Priority 3: Web developers **may** satisfy these requirements, in order to make it easier for some groups to access the Web content. Conformance to this level is described as AAA or Triple-A.

[WCAG 2.2](https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/) was published on Oct, 2023 and [WCAG 3.0](https://w3c.github.io/wcag3/guidelines/) is in development.

# Web performance

**Web performance** is the objective time from when a request for content is made until the requested content is displayed in the user's browser, objective render times, and the subjective user experience of load time and runtime.

Objectively, it is measurable time, in milliseconds, it takes for the web page or web application to be downloaded, painted in the user's web browser, and become responsive and interactive. It is the frames per second and times the main thread is not available for user interactions. Subjectively, it is the user's perception of whether the time it takes between the time the user requests the content and the time until the user feels the content requested is available and usable _feels_ slow or fast.

# Web server

A web server is a piece of software that often runs on a hardware server offering service to a user, usually referred to as the client. A server, on the other hand, is a piece of hardware that lives in a room full of computers, commonly known as a data center.

# Web standards

Web standards are rules established by international standards bodies that define how the {{Glossary("World Wide Web", "Web")}} works (and which sometimes control the {{Glossary("Internet")}} as well).

Several standards bodies are responsible for defining different aspects of the Web, and all the standards must coordinate to keep the Web maximally usable and accessible. Web standards also must evolve to improve the current status and adapt to new circumstances.

This non-exhaustive list gives you an idea of which standards websites and network systems must conform to:

- **IETF** (Internet Engineering Task Force): Internet standards (STD), which among other things govern set-up and use of {{Glossary("URI", "URIs")}}, {{Glossary("HTTP")}}, and {{Glossary("MIME")}}
- **{{Glossary("W3C")}}**: specifications for markup language (e.g., {{Glossary("HTML")}}), style definitions (i.e., {{Glossary("CSS")}}), {{Glossary("DOM")}}, {{Glossary("Accessibility", "accessibility")}}
- **IANA** (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority): name and number registries
- **Ecma Intl.:** scripting standards, most prominently for {{Glossary("JavaScript")}}
- **{{Glossary("ISO")}}** (International Organization for Standardization): standards governing a diverse array of aspects, including character encodings, website management, and user-interface design

## Opposing standards

Occasionally, the members of a standards body may disagree with how a feature is developing, and some may **oppose** it. This means that technology implementers (for example web browser vendors) who disagree with the feature in its current form are unlikely to ever implement it.

Vendors that _do agree_ with the feature usually still implement it so that it is available to experiment with and provide feedback on. This enables interested parties to build use cases and demonstrate the issues with the feature, hopefully working toward reaching a consensus on a future version.

Standards body members often publish a record of their position on different standards, for reference. For example, see [Mozilla Specification Positions](https://mozilla.github.io/standards-positions/) and [WebKit Standards Positions](https://webkit.org/standards-positions/).

# WebDAV

**WebDAV** (_Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning_) is an {{Glossary("HTTP")}} Extension that lets web developers update their content remotely from a client.

WebDAV is rarely used alone, but two extensions are very common: {{Glossary("CalDAV")}} (remote-access calendar) and {{Glossary("CardDAV")}} (remote-access address book).

WebDAV allows clients to

- add, delete, and retrieve webpage metadata (e.g., author or creation date)
- link pages of any media type to related pages
- create sets of documents and retrieve hierarchical list
- copy and move webpages
- lock a document from being edited by more than one person at a time

# WebGL

**WebGL** (_Web Graphics Library_) is a {{Glossary("JavaScript")}} {{Glossary("API")}} that draws interactive 2D and 3D graphics.

The [Khronos Group](https://www.khronos.org/) maintains WebGL, which is based on {{Glossary("OpenGL")}} ES 2.0.

You can invoke WebGL within the {{Glossary("HTML")}} {{HTMLElement("canvas")}} element, which provides a rendering surface.

All major {{Glossary("Browser","browsers")}} now support WebGL, but its availability depends also on external factors (e.g., GPU support).

# WebIDL

**WebIDL** is the interface description language used to describe the {{Glossary("type", "data types")}}, {{Glossary("interface", "interfaces")}}, {{Glossary("method", "methods")}}, {{Glossary("property", "properties")}}, and other components which make up a Web application programming interface ({{Glossary("API")}}). It uses a somewhat stylized syntax which is independent of any specific programming language, so that the underlying code which is used to build each API can be written in whatever language is most appropriate, while still being possible to map the API's components to JavaScript-compatible constructs.

WebIDL is used in nearly every API {{Glossary("specification")}} for the Web, and due to its standard format and syntax, the programmers who create Web browsers can more easily ensure that their browsers are compatible with one another, regardless of how they choose to write the code to implement the API.

# WebKit

_WebKit_ is a framework that displays properly-formatted webpages based on their markup. {{Glossary("Apple Safari")}} depends on WebKit, and so do many mobile browsers (since WebKit is highly portable and customizable).

WebKit began life as a fork of KDE's KHTML and KJS libraries, but many individuals and companies have since contributed (including KDE, Apple, Google, and Nokia).

WebKit is an Apple trademark, and the framework is distributed under a BSD-form license. However, two important components fall under the {{Glossary("LGPL")}}: the **WebCore** rendering library and the **JavaScriptCore** engine.

# WebRTC

**WebRTC** (_Web Real-Time Communication_) is an {{Glossary("API")}} that can be used by video-chat, voice-calling, and P2P-file-sharing Web apps.

WebRTC consists mainly of these parts:

- {{domxref("MediaDevices.getUserMedia", "getUserMedia()")}}
  - : Grants access to a device's camera and/or microphone, and can plug in their signals to a RTC connection.
- {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection")}}
  - : An interface to configure video chat or voice calls.
- {{domxref("RTCDataChannel")}}
  - : Provides a method to set up a {{Glossary("P2P", "peer-to-peer")}} data pathway between browsers.

# Whitespace

**Whitespace** refers to {{Glossary("Character", "characters")}} which are used to provide horizontal or vertical space between other characters. Whitespace is often used to separate tokens in {{Glossary("HTML")}}, {{Glossary("CSS")}}, {{Glossary("JavaScript")}}, and other computer languages.

Whitespace characters and their usage vary among languages.

## In HTML

The [Infra Living Standard](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-whitespace) defines five characters as "{{Glossary("ASCII")}} whitespace": U+0009 TAB, U+000A LF, U+000C FF, U+000D CR, and U+0020 SPACE.

## In JavaScript

The [ECMAScript Language Specification](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/ecmascript-language-lexical-grammar.html#sec-white-space) defines several Unicode code points as "white space": U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION \<TAB>, U+000B LINE TABULATION \<VT>, U+000C FORM FEED \<FF>, U+0020 SPACE \<SP>, U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE \<NBSP>, U+FEFF ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE \<ZWNBSP>, and any other Unicode "Space_Separator" code points \<USP>.

# WindowProxy

A **`WindowProxy`** object is a wrapper for a [`Window`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) object. A `WindowProxy` object exists in every {{Glossary("browsing context")}}. All operations performed on a `WindowProxy` object will also be applied to the underlying `Window` object it currently wraps. Therefore, interacting with a `WindowProxy` object is almost identical to directly interacting with a `Window` object. When a browsing context is navigated, the `Window` object its `WindowProxy` wraps is changed.

# World Wide Web

The _World Wide Web_—commonly referred to as **WWW**, **W3**, or **the Web**—is a system of interconnected public webpages accessible through the {{Glossary("Internet")}}. The Web is not the same as the Internet: the Web is one of many applications built on top of the Internet.

Tim Berners-Lee proposed the architecture of what became known as the World Wide Web. He created the first web {{Glossary("Server","server")}}, web {{Glossary("Browser","browser")}}, and webpage on his computer at the CERN physics research lab in 1990. In 1991, he announced his creation on the alt.hypertext newsgroup, marking the moment the Web was first made public.

The system we know today as "the Web" consists of several components:

- The **{{Glossary("HTTP")}}** protocol governs data transfer between a server and a client.
- To access a Web component, a client supplies a unique universal identifier, called a **{{Glossary("URL")}}** (uniform resource locator) or {{Glossary("URI")}} (uniform resource identifier) (formally called Universal Document Identifier (UDI)).
- **{{Glossary("HTML")}}** (hypertext markup language) is the most common format for publishing web documents.

Linking, or connecting resources through {{Glossary("Hyperlink","hyperlinks")}}, is a defining concept of the Web, aiding its identity as a collection of connected documents.

Soon after inventing the Web, Tim Berners-Lee founded the {{Glossary("W3C")}} (World Wide Web Consortium) to standardize and develop the Web further. This consortium consists of core Web interest groups, such as web browser developers, government entities, researchers, and universities. Its mission includes education and outreach.

# Wrapper

In programming languages such as JavaScript, a wrapper is a function that is intended to call one or more other functions, sometimes purely for convenience, and sometimes adapting them to do a slightly different task in the process.

For example, SDK Libraries for AWS are examples of wrappers.

# XForms

**XForms** is a convention for building Web forms and processing form data in the {{glossary("XML")}} format.

> [!NOTE]
> No major browser supports XForms any longer—we suggest using [Web forms](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms) instead.
# XHTML

**XHTML** is a term that was historically used to describe [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) documents written to conform with {{Glossary("XML")}} syntax rules.

The following example shows an HTML document and corresponding "XHTML" document, and the accompanying {{Glossary("HTTP")}} {{HTTPHeader("Content-Type")}} headers they should be served with.

### HTML document

```html
<!-- Content-Type: text/html -->

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>HTML</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>I am a HTML document</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### XHTML document

```xml
<!-- Content-Type: application/xhtml+xml -->

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <title>XHTML</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>I am a XHTML document</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

In practice, very few "XHTML" documents are served over the web with a `Content-Type: application/xhtml+xml` header. Instead, even though the documents are written to conform to XML syntax rules, they are served with a `Content-Type: text/html` header — so browsers parse those documents using HTML parsers rather than XML parsers.

Simple XLinks are "supported" in Firefox (at least in SVG and MathML), though they do not work as links if one loads a plain XML document with XLinks and attempts to click on the relevant points in the XML tree.

For those who may have found XLink 1.0 cumbersome for regular links, XLink 1.1 drops the need to specify `xlink:type="simple"` for simple links.

XLink is used in [SVG](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG), [MathML](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML), and other important standards.

# XML

eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is a generic markup language specified by the W3C. The information technology (IT) industry uses many languages based on XML as data-description languages.

XML tags resemble HTML tags, but XML is much more flexible because it lets users define their own tags. In this way XML acts like a meta-language—that is, it can be used to define other languages, such as {{Glossary("RSS")}}. Moreover, HTML is a presentation language, whereas XML is a data-description language. This means that XML has far broader applications than just the Web. For example, Web services can use XML to exchange requests and responses.

# XMLHttpRequest (XHR)

{{domxref("XMLHttpRequest")}} (XHR) is a {{Glossary("JavaScript")}} {{Glossary("API")}} to create {{Glossary("HTTP")}} requests. Its methods provide the ability to send network requests between the {{Glossary("browser")}} and a {{Glossary("server")}}.

The [Fetch API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) is the modern replacement for XMLHttpRequest.

# XSLT

_eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations_ (**XSLT**) is a declarative language used to convert {{Glossary("XML")}} documents into other XML documents, {{Glossary("HTML")}}, {{Glossary("PDF")}}, plain text, and so on.

XSLT has its own processor that accepts XML input, or any format convertible to an XQuery and XPath Data Model. The XSLT processor produces a new document based on the XML document and an XSLT stylesheet, making no changes to the original files in the process.

# Zstandard compression

**Zstandard** is a general-purpose lossless compression algorithm.

Zstandard, or `zstd` as short version, is a fast lossless compression algorithm, targeting real-time compression scenarios at zlib-level and better compression ratios. It's backed by a very fast entropy stage, provided by [Huff0 and FSE library](https://github.com/Cyan4973/FiniteStateEntropy). It often offers better compression ratios than {{glossary("Brotli_compression", "brotli")}} at equivalent CPU costs, or better CPU costs at equivalent compression ratios.

# About Learn web development

MDN Learn web development aims to teach the fundamental skills and knowledge that a front-end web developer should have for employability and longevity in today's web industry. It embodies the values we think the web should have — accessibility, sustainability, usability, performance, and community. We would love educators, developers, and students to use this resource and champion these values in their work, in their teachings, and in the products they build.

This content has been created by the MDN community with review and feedback from experts within Mozilla and throughout the wider web community. Thank you for your valuable input; you know who you are!

## Background and motivation

We originally [launched the MDN Learn Web Development section in 2016](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/06/learning-to-code-for-the-web-the-mdn-learning-area-welcomes-you/) with the aim of making MDN more accessible to non-experts and helping to take beginning web developers from "beginner to comfortable".

The content was pretty successful but, moving forward a few years we noted that the structure was sub-par. Beginners really want a robust pathway they can follow to get the knowledge they need, rather than being expected to figure out what to learn and when.

In addition, Mozilla talks to industry professionals every day, and we regularly get feedback on the knowledge gaps in new hires. Hiring managers often observe:

- Too much of a focus on using frameworks to build web apps quickly, coupled with a lack of understanding of the underlying technologies behind these frameworks. This leads to a lack of problem-solving skills and less long-term employability as tools change.
- A lack of core best practices such as semantics, accessibility, and responsive design. This results in a lack of user focus, leading to usability limitations.
- Gaps in the knowledge of how browsers fundamentally work, how they surface information, and the interactivity you get for free. This causes solutions to be overcomplicated and often inaccessible.
- Limited problem-solving, teamwork, research, and other vital soft skills.

As a result, we created a curriculum to help guide people towards learning a better skill set, making them more employable, and enabling them to build a better, more accessible, more responsible web of tomorrow. We want them to have the best possible chance of success. We [launched the MDN Curriculum in early 2024](/en-US/blog/mdn-curriculum-launch/).

However, we quickly received feedback that users found it confusing having two learning resources on MDN, with the curriculum/learning pathway in one place and the learning content in another place. as a result, we [merged the Curriculum into the learning area in December 2024](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Changelog#december_2024).

## Target audience

### Students

This curriculum is useful for several groups of students:

- Students who want to get a job in the industry, which may involve gaining a related qualification or certification. The curriculum will act as a guide for what they should study.
- Existing web developers who want to "level up" their skills, making sure their skill set is current and identifying gaps in their knowledge that they should learn more about.
- Non-front-end web developers who have existing development experience in other areas (for example back-end web developers or platform-specific developers), who wish to get into front-end web development and want a guide to the topics they should learn.

### Educators

Educators can use this content as a guide when creating programs, units, and assessment specifications for a web-related university degree, college course, coding school course, or similar. Conforming to the learning outcomes in our articles will help ensure that courses teach current techniques and best practices, and avoid bad practices and out-of-date information.

To find out more, consult our [Resources for Educators](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Educators) page.

> [!NOTE]
> The complete MDN Learn Web Development Curriculum is available as a convenient PDF to share with your students and colleagues. [Download the Curriculum](https://github.com/mdn/curriculum/releases/latest/download/MDN-Curriculum.pdf).

## Scope

The term _front-end developer_ can be ambiguous; it can mean different things to different people, and folks working on the front end can be expected to do a wide variety of different tasks.

### What's covered

This set of articles does not attempt to teach every topic that a web developer could conceivably be expected to know in-depth. The curriculum covers the following:

- Core technical skills such as semantic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals.
- Best practices such as accessibility, responsive design, and UI design theory.
- Key tools such as frameworks and version control.
- Soft skills for promoting the mindset and attitude required to secure a job.
- Environment knowledge like computer and file systems, browsing the web, command line basics, and code editors.
- Several "extensions" that we feel constitute useful additional skills to learn as developers start to expand their knowledge and develop specialisms. This includes:
  - CSS transforms and animation
  - Common categories of Web API (for example, media, graphics, and client-side storage)
  - Server-side web development fundamentals
  - Performance
  - Security and privacy
  - Testing

### Level of detail

The topics presented are covered in differing levels of detail.

- Some are covered in depth, for example, HTML and CSS fundamentals. These are important to have a clear understanding of before a student goes too far on their learning journey.
- Some are covered more superficially, for example, version control or testing. It is important to understand what these topics are and get started with some basics, but these kinds of skills can be expanded upon as you continue through your career.

### What is not covered

There are also several areas that we explicitly don't cover in this curriculum, namely:

- Exhaustive coverage of back-end languages/platforms. We do provide a brief introduction in [Node.js (Express)](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side/Express_Nodejs) and [Python (Django)](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side/Django) as it is useful to every web developer to understand how HTTP and server-side technologies work. However, we don't provide exhaustive coverage across multiple platforms; that would be out of scope for MDN.
- In-depth coverage of traditional relational databases (for example, [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/) or [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)) and other server-side datastores (for example, cloud databases such as [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) or [Google Cloud Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/products/datastore)). We provide a brief introduction to such technologies in our [Server-side website programming](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side) modules.
- Deep-dive DevOps topics such as cloud platforms for provisioning and automation (for example, [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/), and [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/)) and containerization tools (for example, [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)). We lightly touch upon some tools that are considered to be in the DevOps space — like GitHub and automated testing tools — but these have distinct crossover into the front-end developer space.
- Graphic design beyond the basic knowledge outlined in [Design for developers](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Design_for_developers).
- Skills related to roles such as product and program management (for example, organization, research, and planning).

## Attribution

This resource is free for anyone to use. If you find it useful, we request that you consider doing the following:

- Link to it. For example, an educator could include the following in their public program information:

  ```html
  <p>
    This course is based on
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/curriculum/"
      >MDN Learn Web Development</a
    >.
  </p>
  ```

- Tell others about it! We would love as many students and educators as possible to start using this material and converging around it as a standard for web developer baseline knowledge.

> [!NOTE]
> Educators should use this material as a guide, but its use does not imply endorsement by Mozilla.

## Update process

The web development industry is changing constantly and rapidly. To keep our recommendations current, we will review our material regularly, update our [changelog](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Changelog), and make an announcement every year, contacting the creators of known conforming courses to let them know the course has changed and encourage them to review/update their courses as appropriate.

We intend to do this in Q2 each year, to give educators time over Q2/Q3 to implement changes before the start of the following academic year.

## Frequently asked questions

### Scrimba partnership questions

#### How does MDN know Scrimba's courses are high quality and follow best practices?

Scrimba already had a great reputation before we started talking to them about a partnership. However, we didn't just take the community's word for it. We did an extensive review of Scrimba's [Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/the-frontend-developer-career-path-c0j:details?via=mdn) (FDCP) and provided them with feedback on possible improvements, focusing on increasing coverage of best practices and conformance to our [Core modules](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core). Scrimba implemented all of our feedback, and the FDCP is even better than it was before. Now that it conforms to our Curriculum Core, we are confident it aligns with MDN standards.

#### Is MDN sharing user data with Scrimba?

We prioritize user privacy and transparency. The only information MDN shares with Scrimba is user navigation to Scrimba from MDN, and this happens through their own actions by following a link that is marked as external.

In cases where we embed Scrimba content on MDN, Scrimba won't see user data until a user chooses to interact with Scrimba's content.

#### Scrimba's content isn't free. Doesn't this conflict with MDN's philosophy of providing free content?

A lot of Scrimba's content requires a paid subscription, but they also offer several complete courses that are free to access after you register.

It is also worth pointing out that Scrimba's courses are not necessary to make use of MDN Learn Web Development — they are an enhancement for those who wish to pay for a structured course that covers our curriculum core. You can still learn all our learning outcomes for free by working through our articles.

#### Is a certification awarded on completing Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path?

Yes, once you complete all the topics in the Frontend Developer Career Path, you can access a certificate of completion to share with potential employers or include in your portfolio. See [Where can I find my completion certificate?](https://forum.scrimba.com/t/where-can-i-find-my-completion-certificate/43?via=mdn) for more information.
# Changelog

## August 2025

In the summer of 2025, we completed work on significant changes to the structure and positioning of our "Test your skills" articles and other reader exercises:

- The "Test your skills" article content has been updated so that the language and approach in each one is consistent. For example, all of the old interactive editors have been replaced with live sample exercises that make use of the [MDN Playground](/en-US/play), and most of the repetitive boilerplate has been consolidated into a single [Test your skills help section](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development#test_your_skills).
- The position of the "Test your skills" articles in the navigation has been updated. Instead of being available from "Test your skills" submenus and linked to from the end of associated tutorials, the articles now appear in the sidebar and in the previous/next links. They are now mandatory articles in the flow, rather than optional resources.
- The reader exercises in the tutorials have also been modernized, to replace old code editors and make language consistent.

## December 2024

A major update to the Learn web development section was started in November 2024 and finally published in December 2024. To summarize, the MDN Curriculum has been merged into Learn web development.

Specifically:

- The content is the same, but it has been rearranged to follow the same learning pathway structure as the Curriculum. In a few cases, content was deemed not suitable for a beginner audience and has been migrated to other parts of MDN.
- Specific learning outcomes have been added to the top of most of the articles, to match the learning outcomes detailed in the Curriculum.
- Other features from the Curriculum have been migrated across to the Learn Web Development section, such as the [About](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/About) page and [Resources for educators](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Educators).

The [original curriculum pages](/en-US/curriculum/) are being kept as a summary of the Learn web development content that is useful for educators when planning curricula.

Moving forward, we will continue to update the content and design to make Learn web development even more useful to learners and educators.
# Challenge: Accessibility troubleshooting

{{PreviousMenuNext("Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/Mobile","Learn_web_development/Core/Design_for_developers", "Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility")}}

In the challenge for this module, we present to you a simple site with a number of accessibility issues that you need to diagnose and fix.

## Starting point

To start this challenge, you should go and grab the [ZIP containing the files that comprise the example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/learning-area/main/accessibility/assessment-start/assessment-files.zip). Decompress the contents into a new directory somewhere on your local computer.

Alternatively, you could use an online editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/).

The finished challenge site should look like so:

![Screenshot of the finished challenge site with good color contrast. The search input has placeholder text and a submit button that reads go, but no visible label.](assessment-site-finished.png)

You will see some differences/issues with the display of the starting state of the challenge — this is mainly due to the differences in the markup, which in turn cause some styling issues as the CSS is not applied properly. Don't worry — you'll be fixing these problems in the upcoming sections!

> [!NOTE]
> If you get stuck, you can reach out to us in one of our [communication channels](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels).

## Project brief

For this project, you are presented with a fictional nature site displaying a "factual" article about bears. As it stands, it has a number of accessibility issues — your task is to explore the existing site and fix them to the best of your abilities, answering the questions given below.

### Color

The text is difficult to read because of the current color scheme. Can you do a test of the current color contrast (text/background), report the results of the test, and then fix it by changing the assigned colors?

### Semantic HTML

1. The content is still not very accessible — report on what happens when you try to navigate it using a screen reader.
2. Can you update the article text to make it easier for screen reader users to navigate?
3. The navigation menu part of the site (wrapped in `<div class="nav"></div>`) could be made more accessible by putting it in a proper HTML semantic element. Which one should it be updated to? Make the update.

> [!NOTE]
> You'll need to update the CSS rule selectors that style the tags to their proper equivalents for the semantic headings. Once you add paragraph elements, you'll notice the styling looking better.

### The images

The images are currently inaccessible to screen reader users. Can you fix this?

### The audio player

1. The `<audio>` player isn't accessible to hearing impaired (deaf) people — can you add some kind of accessible alternative for these users?
2. The `<audio>` player isn't accessible to those using older browsers that don't support HTML audio. How can you allow them to still access the audio?

### The forms

1. The `<input>` element in the search form at the top could do with a label, but we don't want to add a visible text label that would potentially spoil the design and isn't really needed by sighted users. How can you add a label that is only accessible to screen readers?
2. The two `<input>` elements in the comment form have visible text labels, but they are not unambiguously associated with their labels — how do you achieve this? Note that you'll need to update some of the CSS rule as well.

### The show/hide comment control

The show/hide comment control button is not currently keyboard-accessible. Can you make it keyboard accessible, both in terms of focusing it using the tab key, and activating it using the return key?

### The table

The data table is not currently very accessible — it is hard for screen reader users to associate data rows and columns together, and the table also has no kind of summary to make it clear what it shows. Can you add some features to your HTML to fix this problem?

### Other considerations?

Can you list two more ideas for improvements that would make the website more accessible?

# CSS and JavaScript accessibility best practices

{{PreviousMenuNext("Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/Test_your_skills/HTML","Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/Test_your_skills/CSS_and_JavaScript", "Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility")}}

CSS and JavaScript, when used properly, also have the potential to allow for accessible web experiences, or they can significantly harm accessibility if misused. This article outlines some CSS and JavaScript best practices that should be considered to ensure even complex content is as accessible as possible.

## CSS and JavaScript are accessible?

CSS and JavaScript don't have the same immediate importance for accessibility as HTML, but they are still able to help or damage accessibility, depending on how they are used. To put it another way, it is important that you consider some best practice advice to make sure that your use of CSS and JavaScript doesn't ruin the accessibility of your documents.

## CSS

Let's start off by looking at CSS.

### Correct semantics and user expectation

It is possible to use CSS to make any HTML element look like _anything_, but this doesn't mean that you should. As we frequently mentioned in our [HTML: A good basis for accessibility](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/HTML) article, you should use the appropriate semantic element for the job, whenever possible. If you don't, it can cause confusion and usability issues for everyone, but particularly users with disabilities. Using correct semantics has a lot to do with user expectations — elements look and behave in certain ways, according to their functionality, and these common conventions are expected by users.

As an example, a screen reader user can't navigate a page via heading elements if the developer hasn't appropriately used heading elements to markup the content. By the same token, a heading loses its visual purpose if you style it so it doesn't look like a heading.

Bottom line, you can update the styling of a page feature to fit in your design, but don't change it so much that it no longer looks or behaves as expected. The following sections summarize the main HTML features to consider.

#### "Standard" text content structure

Headings, paragraphs, lists — the core text content of your page:

```html
<h1>Heading</h1>

<p>Paragraph</p>

<ul>
  <li>My list</li>
  <li>has two items.</li>
</ul>
```

Some typical CSS might look like this:

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 5rem;
}

p,
li {
  line-height: 1.5;
  font-size: 1.6rem;
}
```

You should:

- Select sensible font sizes, line heights, letter spacing, etc. to make your text logical, legible, and comfortable to read.
- Make sure your headings stand out from your body text, typically big and bold like the default styling. Your lists should look like lists.
- Your text color should contrast well with your background color.

See [Headings and paragraphs in HTML](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Headings_and_paragraphs) and [CSS text styling](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Text_styling) for more information.

#### Emphasized text

Inline markup that confers specific emphasis to the text that it wraps:

```html
<p>The water is <em>very hot</em>.</p>

<p>
  Water droplets collecting on surfaces is called <strong>condensation</strong>.
</p>
```

You might want to add some simple coloring to your emphasized text:

```css
strong,
em {
  color: #a60000;
}
```

You will however rarely need to style emphasis elements in any significant way. The standard conventions of bold and italic text are very recognizable, and changing the style can cause confusion. For more on emphasis, see [Emphasis and importance](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Emphasis_and_importance).

#### Abbreviations

An element that allows an abbreviation, acronym, or initialization to be associated with its expansion:

```html
<p>
  Web content is marked up using Hypertext Markup Language, or
  <abbr>HTML</abbr>.
</p>
```

Again, you might want to style it in some simple way:

```css
abbr {
  color: #a60000;
}
```

The recognized styling convention for abbreviations is a dotted underline, and it is unwise to significantly deviate from this. For more on abbreviations, see [Abbreviations](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Advanced_text_features#abbreviations).

#### Links

Hyperlinks — the way you get to new places on the web:

```html
<p>Visit the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla homepage</a>.</p>
```

Some very simple link styling is shown below:

```css
a {
  color: red;
}

a:hover,
a:visited,
a:focus {
  color: #a60000;
  text-decoration: none;
}

a:active {
  color: black;
  background-color: #a60000;
}
```

The standard link conventions are underlined and a different color (default: blue) in their standard state, another color variation when the link has previously been visited (default: purple), and yet another color when the link is activated (default: red). In addition, the mouse pointer changes to a pointer icon when links are moused over, and the link receives a highlight when focused (e.g., via tabbing) or activated. The following image shows the highlight in both Firefox (a dotted outline) and Chrome (a blue outline):

![Screenshot of a list of links in Firefox browser. The list contains 4 items. The second list item is highlighted using a blue dotted outline when it is focussed via tabbing.](focus-highlight-firefox.png)

![Screenshot of a list of links in Chrome browser. The list contains 4 items. The third list item is highlighted using a blue outline when it is focussed via tabbing.](focus-highlight-chrome.png)

You can be creative with link styles, as long as you keep giving users feedback when they interact with the links. Something should definitely happen when states change, and you shouldn't get rid of the pointer cursor or the outline — both are very important accessibility aids for those using keyboard controls.

#### Form elements

Elements to allow users to input data into websites:

```html
<div>
  <label for="name">Enter your name</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" />
</div>
```

You can see some good example CSS in our [form-css.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/accessibility/css/form-css.html) example ([see it live](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/css/form-css.html) also).

Most of the CSS you'll write for forms will be for sizing the elements, lining up labels and inputs, and getting them looking neat and tidy.

You shouldn't however deviate too much from the expected visual feedback form elements receive when they are focused, which is basically the same as links (see above). You could style form focus/hover states to make this behavior more consistent across browsers or fit in better with your page design, but don't get rid of it altogether — again, people rely on these clues to help them know what is going on.

#### Tables

Tables for presenting tabular data.

You can see a good, simple example of table HTML and CSS in our [table-css.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/accessibility/css/table-css.html) example ([see it live also](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/css/table-css.html)).

Table CSS generally serves to make the table fit better into your design and look less ugly. It is a good idea to make sure the table headers stand out (normally using bold), and use zebra striping to make different rows easier to parse.

### Color and color contrast

When choosing a color scheme for your website, make sure that the text (foreground) color contrasts well with the background color. Your design might look cool, but it is no good if people with visual impairments like color blindness can't read your content.

There is an easy way to check whether your contrast is large enough to not cause problems. There are a number of contrast checking tools online that you can enter your foreground and background colors into, to check them. For example WebAIM's [Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) is simple to use, and provides an explanation of what you need to conform to the WCAG criteria around color contrast.

> [!NOTE]
> A high contrast ratio will also allow anyone using a smartphone or tablet with a glossy screen to better read pages when in a bright environment, such as sunlight.

Another tip is to not rely on color alone for signposts/information, as this will be no good for those who can't see the color. Instead of marking required form fields in red, for example, mark them with an asterisk and in red.

### Hiding things

There are many instances where a visual design will require that not all content is shown at once. For example, in our [Tabbed info box example](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/css/css-layout/practical-positioning-examples/tabbed-info-box.html) (see [source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/css/css-layout/practical-positioning-examples/tabbed-info-box.html)) we have three panels of information, but we are [positioning](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Positioning) them on top of one another and providing tabs that can be clicked to show each one (it is also keyboard accessible — you can alternatively use Tab and Enter/Return to select them).

![Three tab interface with Tab 1 selected and only its contents are displayed. The contents of other tabs are hidden. If a tab is selected, then its text-color changes from black to white and the background-color changes from orange-red to saddle brown.](tabbed-info-box.png)

Screen reader users don't care about any of this — they are happy with the content as long as the source order makes sense, and they can get to it all. Absolute positioning (as used in this example) is generally seen as one of the best mechanisms of hiding content for visual effect because it doesn't stop screen readers from getting to it.

On the other hand, you shouldn't use {{cssxref("visibility", "visibility: hidden")}} or {{cssxref("display", "display: none")}}, because they do hide content from screen readers. Unless of course, there is a good reason why you want this content to be hidden from screen readers.

> [Invisible Content Just for Screen Reader Users](https://webaim.org/techniques/css/invisiblecontent/) has a lot more useful detail surrounding this topic.

### Accept that users can override styles

It is possible for users to override your styles with their own custom styles, for example:

- See Sarah Maddox's [How to use a custom style sheet (CSS) with Firefox](https://www.itsupportguides.com/knowledge-base/computer-accessibility/how-to-use-a-custom-style-sheet-css-with-firefox/) for a useful guide covering how to do this manually in Firefox.
- It is probably easier to do it using an extension. For example, the Stylus extension is available for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/), with Stylish being a [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe) equivalent.

Users might do this for a variety of reasons. A visually impaired user might want to make the text bigger on all websites they visit, or a user with severe color deficiency might want to put all websites in high contrast colors that are easy for them to see. Whatever the need, you should be comfortable with this, and make your designs flexible enough so that such changes will work in your design. As an example, you might want to make sure your main content area can handle bigger text (maybe it will start to scroll to allow it all to be seen), and won't just hide it, or break completely.

## JavaScript

JavaScript can also break accessibility, depending on how it is used.

Modern JavaScript is a powerful language, and we can do so much with it these days, from simple content and UI updates to fully-fledged 2D and 3D games. There is no rule that says all content has to be 100% accessible to all people — you just need to do what you can, and make your apps as accessible as possible.

Simple content and functionality is arguably easy to make accessible — for example text, images, tables, forms and push button that activate functions. As we looked at in our [HTML: A good basis for accessibility](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/HTML) article, the key considerations are:

- Good semantics: Using the right element for the right job. For example, making sure you use headings and paragraphs, and {{htmlelement("button")}} and {{htmlelement("a")}} elements
- Making sure content is available as text, either directly as text content, good text labels for form elements, or [text alternatives](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/HTML#text_alternatives), e.g., alt text for images.

We also looked at an example of how to use JavaScript to build in functionality where it is missing — see [Building keyboard accessibility back in](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/HTML#building_keyboard_accessibility_back_in). This is not ideal — really you should just use the right element for the right job — but it shows that it is possible in situations where for some reason you can't control the markup that is used. Another way to improve accessibility for non-semantic JavaScript-powered widgets is to use WAI-ARIA to provide extra semantics for screen reader users. The next article will also cover this in detail.

Complex functionality like 3D games are not so easy to make accessible — a complex 3D game created using [WebGL](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) will be rendered on a {{htmlelement("canvas")}} element, which has no facility at this time to provide text alternatives or other information for severely visually impaired users to make use of. It is arguable that such a game doesn't really have this group of people as a part of its main target audience, and it would be unreasonable to expect you to make it 100% accessible to blind people. However, you could implement [keyboard controls](/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/Control_mechanisms/Desktop_with_mouse_and_keyboard) so it is usable by non-mouse users, and make the color scheme contrasting enough to be usable by those with color deficiencies.

### The problem with too much JavaScript

The problem often comes when people rely on JavaScript too much. Sometimes you'll see a website where everything has been done with JavaScript — the HTML has been generated by JavaScript, the CSS has been generated by JavaScript, etc. This has all kinds of accessibility and other issues associated with it, so it is not advised.

As well as using the right element for the right job, you should also make sure you are using the right technology for the right job! Think carefully about whether you need that shiny JavaScript-powered 3D information box, or whether plain old text would do. Think carefully about whether you need a complex non-standard form widget, or whether a text input would do. And don't generate all your HTML content using JavaScript if at all possible.

### Keeping it unobtrusive

You should keep **unobtrusive JavaScript** in mind when creating your content. The idea of unobtrusive JavaScript is that it should be used wherever possible to enhance functionality, not build it in entirely — basic functions should ideally work without JavaScript, although it is appreciated that this is not always an option. But again, a large part of it is using built-in browser functionality where possible.

Good example uses of unobtrusive JavaScript include:

- Providing client-side form validation, which alerts users to problems with their form entries quickly, without having to wait for the server to check the data. If it isn't available, the form will still work, but validation might be slower.
- Providing custom controls for HTML `<video>`s that are accessible to keyboard-only users, along with a direct link to the video that can be used to access it if JavaScript is not available (the default `<video>` browser controls aren't keyboard accessible in most browsers).

As an example, we've written a quick and dirty client-side form validation example — see [form-validation.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/accessibility/css/form-validation.html) (also [see the demo live](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/css/form-validation.html)). Here you'll see a simple form; when you try to submit the form with one or both fields left empty, the submit fails, and an error message box appears to tell you what is wrong.

This kind of form validation is unobtrusive — you can still use the form absolutely fine without the JavaScript being available, and any sensible form implementation will have server-side validation active as well, because it is too easy for malicious users to bypass client-side validation (for example, by turning JavaScript off in the browser). The client-side validation is still really useful for reporting errors — users can know about mistakes they make instantly, rather than having to wait for a round trip to the server and a page reload. This is a definite usability advantage.

> [!NOTE]
> Server-side validation has not been implemented in this simple demo.

We've made this form validation pretty accessible too. We've used {{htmlelement("label")}} elements to make sure the form labels are unambiguously linked to their inputs, so screen readers can read them out alongside:

```html
<label for="name">Enter your name:</label>
<input type="text" name="name" id="name" />
```

We only do the validation when the form is submitted — this is so that we don't update the UI too often and potentially confuse screen reader (and possibly other) users:

```js
form.onsubmit = validate;

function validate(e) {
  errorList.textContent = "";
  for (const testItem of formItems) {
    if (testItem.input.value === "") {
      errorField.style.left = "360px";
      createLink(testItem);
    }
  }

  if (errorList.hasChildNodes()) {
    e.preventDefault();
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> In this example, we are hiding and showing the error message box using absolute positioning rather than another method such as visibility or display, because it doesn't interfere with the screen reader being able to read content from it.

Real form validation would be much more complex than this — you'd want to check that the entered name actually looks like a name, the entered age is actually a number and is realistic (e.g., nonnegative and less than 4 digits). Here we've just implemented a simple check that a value has been filled in to each input field (`if (testItem.input.value === '')`).

When the validation has been performed, if the tests pass then the form is submitted. If there are errors (`if (errorList.hasChildNodes())`) then we stop the form submitting (using [`preventDefault()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault)), and display any error messages that have been created (see below). This mechanism means that the errors will only be shown if there are errors, which is better for usability.

For each input that doesn't have a value filled in when the form is submitted, we create a list item with a link and insert it in the `errorList`.

```js
function createLink(testItem) {
  const listItem = document.createElement("li");
  const anchor = document.createElement("a");

  const name = testItem.input.name;
  anchor.textContent = `${name} field is empty: fill in your ${name}.`;
  anchor.href = `#${name}`;
  listItem.appendChild(anchor);
  errorList.appendChild(listItem);
}
```

Each link serves a dual purpose — it tells you what the error is, plus you can click on it/activate it to jump straight to the input element in question and correct your entry.

In addition, the `errorField` is placed at the top of the source order (although it is positioned differently in the UI using CSS), meaning that users can find out exactly what's wrong with their form submissions and get to the input elements in question by going back up to the start of the page.

As a final note, we have used some WAI-ARIA attributes in our demo to help solve accessibility problems caused by areas of content constantly updating without a page reload (screen readers won't pick this up or alert users to it by default):

```html
<div class="errors" role="alert" aria-relevant="all">
  <ul></ul>
</div>
```

We will explain these attributes in our next article, which covers [WAI-ARIA](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/WAI-ARIA_basics) in much more detail.

> [!NOTE]
> Some of you will probably be thinking about the fact that HTML forms have built-in validation mechanisms like the `required`, `min`/`minlength`, and `max`/`maxlength` attributes (see the {{htmlelement("input")}} element reference for more information). We didn't end up using these in the demo because cross-browser support for them is patchy (for example IE10 and above only).

> [!NOTE]
> WebAIM's [Usable and Accessible Form Validation and Error Recovery](https://webaim.org/techniques/formvalidation/) provides some further useful information about accessible form validation.

### Other JavaScript accessibility concerns

There are other things to be aware of when implementing JavaScript and thinking about accessibility. We will add more as we find them.

#### mouse-specific events

As you will be aware, most user interactions are implemented in client-side JavaScript using event handlers, which allow us to run functions in response to certain events happening. Some events can have accessibility issues. The main example you'll come across is mouse-specific events like [mouseover](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mouseover_event), [mouseout](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mouseout_event), [dblclick](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/dblclick_event), etc. Functionality that runs in response to these events will not be accessible using other mechanisms, like keyboard controls.

To mitigate such problems, you should double up these events with similar events that can be activated by other means (so-called device-independent event handlers) — [focus](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/focus_event) and [blur](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/blur_event) would provide accessibility for keyboard users.

Let's look at an example that highlights when this could be useful. Maybe we want to provide a thumbnail image that shows a larger version of the image when it is moused over or focused (like you'd see on an e-commerce product catalog.)

We've made a very simple example, which you can find at [mouse-and-keyboard-events.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/css/mouse-and-keyboard-events.html) (see also the [source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/accessibility/css/mouse-and-keyboard-events.html)). The code features two functions that show and hide the zoomed-in image; these are run by the following lines that set them as event handlers:

```js
imgThumb.onmouseover = showImg;
imgThumb.onmouseout = hideImg;

imgThumb.onfocus = showImg;
imgThumb.onblur = hideImg;
```

The first two lines run the functions when the mouse pointer hovers over and stops hovering over the thumbnail, respectively. This won't allow us to access the zoomed view by keyboard though — to allow that, we've included the last two lines, which run the functions when the image is focused and blurred (when focus stops). This can be done by tabbing over the image, because we've included `tabindex="0"` on it.

The [click](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event) event is interesting — it sounds mouse-dependent, but most browsers will activate [onclick](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event) event handlers after Enter/Return is pressed on a link or form element that has focus, or when such an element is tapped on a touchscreen device. This doesn't work by default however when you allow a non-default-focusable event to have focus using tabindex — in such cases you need to detect specifically when that exact key is pressed (see [Building keyboard accessibility back in](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/HTML#building_keyboard_accessibility_back_in)).

## Summary

We hope this article has given you a good amount of detail and understanding about the accessibility issues surrounding CSS and JavaScript use on web pages.

In the next article, we'll give you some tests that you can use to check how well you've understood and retained all this information.

A great deal of web content can be made accessible just by making sure the correct Hypertext Markup Language elements are used for the correct purpose at all times. This article looks in detail at how HTML can be used to ensure maximum accessibility.

## HTML and accessibility

As you learn more about HTML — read more resources, look at more examples, etc. — you'll keep seeing a common theme: the importance of using semantic HTML (sometimes called POSH, or Plain Old Semantic HTML). This means using the correct HTML elements for their intended purpose as much as possible.

You might wonder why this is so important. After all, you can use a combination of CSS and JavaScript to make just about any HTML element behave in whatever way you want. For example, a control button to play a video on your site could be marked up like this:

```html
<div>Play video</div>
```

But as you'll see in greater detail later on, it makes sense to use the correct element for the job:

```html
<button>Play video</button>
```

Not only do HTML `<button>`s have some suitable styling applied by default (which you will probably want to override), they also have built-in keyboard accessibility — users can navigate between buttons using the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key and activate their selection using <kbd>Space</kbd>, <kbd>Return</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

Semantic HTML doesn't take any longer to write than non-semantic (bad) markup if you do it consistently from the start of your project. Even better, semantic markup has other benefits beyond accessibility:

1. **Easier to develop with** — as mentioned above, you get some functionality for free, plus it is arguably easier to understand.
2. **Better on mobile** — semantic HTML is arguably lighter in file size than non-semantic spaghetti code, and easier to make responsive.
3. **Good for SEO** — search engines give more importance to keywords inside headings, links, etc. than keywords included in non-semantic `<div>`s, etc., so your documents will be more findable by customers.

Let's get on and look at accessible HTML in more detail.

## Good semantics

We've already talked about the importance of proper semantics, and why we should use the right HTML element for the job. This cannot be ignored, as it is one of the main places that accessibility is badly broken if not handled properly.

Out there on the web, the truth is that people do some very strange things with HTML markup. Often, misuse of HTML is because of legacy practices that haven't gone away yet, but sometimes it occurs because authors don't know any better. Whatever the case, you should replace bad code with good semantic markup wherever possible, in both static HTML pages and dynamically-generated HTML from [server-side](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side) code or [client-side JavaScript frameworks](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Frameworks_libraries) such as React.

Sometimes you are not in a position to get rid of lousy markup — your pages might be dependant on server-side code or web/framework components that you have no control over, or you might have third-party content on your page (such as ad banners).

The goal isn't "all or nothing"; every improvement you can make will help the cause of accessibility.

### Use well-structured text content

One of the best accessibility aids a screen reader user can have is an excellent text structure with headings, paragraphs, lists, etc. A good semantic example might look something like the following:

```html example-good
<h1>My heading</h1>

<p>This is the first section of my document.</p>

<p>I'll add another paragraph here too.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Here is</li>
  <li>a list for</li>
  <li>you to read</li>
</ol>

<h2>My subheading</h2>

<p>
  This is the first subsection of my document. I'd love people to be able to
  find this content!
</p>

<h2>My 2nd subheading</h2>

<p>
  This is the second subsection of my content, which I think is more interesting
  than the last one.
</p>
```

We've prepared a version with longer text for you to try out with a screen reader (see [good-semantics.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/html/good-semantics.html)). If you try navigating through this, you'll see that this is pretty easy to navigate:

1. The screen reader reads each header out as you progress through the content, notifying you what a heading is, what is a paragraph, etc.
2. It stops after each element, letting you go at whatever pace is comfortable for you.
3. You can jump to the next/previous heading in many screen readers.
4. You can also bring up a list of all headings in many screen readers, allowing you to use them as a handy table of contents to find specific content.

People sometimes write headings, paragraphs, etc. using line breaks and adding HTML elements purely for styling, something like the following:

```html example-bad
<span style="font-size: 3em">My heading</span> <br /><br />
This is the first section of my document.
<br /><br />
I'll add another paragraph here too.
<br /><br />
1. Here is
<br /><br />
2. a list for
<br /><br />
3. you to read
<br /><br />
<span style="font-size: 2.5em">My subheading</span>
<br /><br />
This is the first subsection of my document. I'd love people to be able to find
this content!
<br /><br />
<span style="font-size: 2.5em">My 2nd subheading</span>
<br /><br />
This is the second subsection of my content. I think is more interesting than
the last one.
```

If you try our longer version out with a screen reader (see [bad-semantics.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/html/bad-semantics.html)), you'll not have a very good experience — the screen reader hasn't got anything to use as signposts, so you can't retrieve a useful table of contents, and the whole page is seen as a single giant block, so it is just read out in one go, all at once.

There are other issues too beyond accessibility — it is harder to style the content using CSS, or manipulate it with JavaScript, for example, because there are no elements to use as selectors.

### Use clear language

The language you use can also affect accessibility. In general, you should use clear language that is not overly complex and doesn't use unnecessary jargon or slang terms. This not only benefits people with cognitive or other disabilities; it benefits readers for whom the text is not written in their first language, younger people…, everyone, in fact! Apart from this, you should try to avoid using language and characters that don't get read out clearly by the screen reader. For example:

- Don't use dashes if you can avoid it. Instead of writing 5–7, write 5 to 7.
- Expand abbreviations — instead of writing Jan, write January.
- Expand acronyms, at least once or twice, then use the [`<abbr>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/abbr) tag to describe them.

### Structure page sections logically

You should use appropriate [sectioning elements](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements#content_sectioning) to structure your webpages, for example navigation ({{htmlelement("nav")}}), footer ({{htmlelement("footer")}}), and repeating content units ({{htmlelement("article")}}). These provide extra semantics for screen readers (and other tools) to give users extra clues about the content they are navigating.

For example, a modern content structure could look something like this:

```html
<header>
  <h1>Header</h1>
</header>

<nav>
  <!-- main navigation in here -->
</nav>

<!-- Here is our page's main content -->
<main>
  <!-- It contains an article -->
  <article>
    <h2>Article heading</h2>

    <!-- article content in here -->
  </article>

  <aside>
    <h2>Related</h2>

    <!-- aside content in here -->
  </aside>
</main>

<!-- And here is our main footer that is used across all the pages of our website -->

<footer>
  <!-- footer content in here -->
</footer>
```

You can find a [full example here](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/introduction-to-html/document_and_website_structure/).

In addition to having good semantics and an attractive layout, your content should make logical sense in its source order — you can always place it where you want using CSS later on, but you should get the source order right to start with, so what screen reader users get read out to them will make sense.

### Use semantic UI controls where possible

By UI controls, we mean the main parts of web documents that users interact with — most commonly buttons, links, and form controls. In this section, we'll look at the basic accessibility concerns to be aware of when creating such controls. Later articles on WAI-ARIA and multimedia will look at other aspects of UI accessibility.

One key aspect of the accessibility of UI controls is that by default, browsers allow them to be manipulated by the keyboard. You can try this out using our [native-keyboard-accessibility.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/tools-testing/cross-browser-testing/accessibility/native-keyboard-accessibility.html) example (see the [source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/tools-testing/cross-browser-testing/accessibility/native-keyboard-accessibility.html)). Open this in a new tab, and try pressing the tab key; after a few presses, you should see the tab focus start to move through the different focusable elements. The focused elements are given a highlighted default style in every browser (it differs slightly between different browsers) so that you can tell what element is focused.

![Three buttons with the text "Click me!", "Click me too!", and "And me!" inside them respectively. The third button has a blue outline around it to indicate current tab focus.](button-focused-unfocused.png)

> [!NOTE]
> You can enable an overlay that shows the page tabbing order in your developer tools. For more information see: [Accessibility Inspector > Show web page tabbing order](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/accessibility_inspector/index.html#show-web-page-tabbing-order).

You can then press Enter/Return to follow a focused link or press a button (we've included some JavaScript to make the buttons alert a message), or start typing to enter text in a text input. Other form elements have different controls; for example, the {{htmlelement("select")}} element can have its options displayed and cycled between using the up and down arrow keys.

You essentially get this behavior for free, just by using the appropriate elements, for example:

```html example-good
<h1>Links</h1>

<p>This is a link to <a href="https://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>.</p>

<p>
  Another link, to the
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org">Mozilla Developer Network</a>.
</p>

<h2>Buttons</h2>

<p>
  <button data-message="This is from the first button">Click me!</button>
  <button data-message="This is from the second button">Click me too!</button>
  <button data-message="This is from the third button">And me!</button>
</p>

<h2>Form</h2>

<form>
  <div>
    <label for="name">Fill in your name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="age">Enter your age:</label>
    <input type="text" id="age" name="age" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="mood">Choose your mood:</label>
    <select id="mood" name="mood">
      <option>Happy</option>
      <option>Sad</option>
      <option>Angry</option>
      <option>Worried</option>
    </select>
  </div>
</form>
```

This means using links, buttons, form elements, and labels appropriately (including the {{htmlelement("label")}} element for form controls).

However, this is another case where people sometimes do strange things with HTML. For example, you sometimes see buttons marked up using {{htmlelement("div")}}s, for example:

```html example-bad
<div data-message="This is from the first button">Click me!</div>
<div data-message="This is from the second button">Click me too!</div>
<div data-message="This is from the third button">And me!</div>
```

But using such code is not advised — you immediately lose the native keyboard accessibility you would have had if you'd just used {{htmlelement("button")}} elements, plus you don't get any of the default CSS styling that buttons get. In the rare to non-existent case when you need to use a non-button element for a button, use the [`button` role](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/button_role) and implement all the default button behaviors, including keyboard and mouse button support.

#### Building keyboard accessibility back in

Adding such advantages back in takes a bit of work (you can see an example in our [fake-div-buttons.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/tools-testing/cross-browser-testing/accessibility/fake-div-buttons.html) example — also see the [source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/tools-testing/cross-browser-testing/accessibility/fake-div-buttons.html)). Here we've given our fake `<div>` buttons the ability to be focused (including via tab) by giving each one the attribute `tabindex="0"`. We also include `role="button"` so screen reader users know they can focus on and interact with the element:

```html
<div data-message="This is from the first button" tabindex="0" role="button">
  Click me!
</div>
<div data-message="This is from the second button" tabindex="0" role="button">
  Click me too!
</div>
<div data-message="This is from the third button" tabindex="0" role="button">
  And me!
</div>
```

Basically, the [`tabindex`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/tabindex) attribute is primarily intended to allow tabbable elements to have a custom tab order (specified in positive numerical order), instead of just being tabbed through in their default source order. This is nearly always a bad idea, as it can cause major confusion. Use it only if you really need to, for example, if the layout shows things in a very different visual order to the source code, and you want to make things work more logically. There are two other options for `tabindex`:

- `tabindex="0"` — as indicated above, this value allows elements that are not normally tabbable to become tabbable. This is the most useful value of `tabindex`.
- `tabindex="-1"` — this allows not normally tabbable elements to receive focus programmatically, e.g., via JavaScript, or as the target of links.

While the above addition allows us to tab to the buttons, it does not allow us to activate them via the <kbd>Enter</kbd>/<kbd>Return</kbd> key. To do that, we had to add the following bit of JavaScript:

```js
document.onkeydown = (e) => {
  // The Enter/Return key
  if (e.key === "Enter") {
    document.activeElement.click();
  }
};
```

Here we add a listener to the `document` object to detect when a button has been pressed on the keyboard. We check what button was pressed via the event object's [`key`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key) property; if the key pressed is <kbd>Enter</kbd>/<kbd>Return</kbd>, we run the function stored in the button's `onclick` handler using `document.activeElement.click()`. [`activeElement`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/activeElement) which gives us the element that is currently focused on the page.

This is a lot of extra hassle to build the functionality back in. And there's bound to be other problems with it. **Better to just use the right element for the right job in the first place.**

#### Use meaningful text labels

UI control text labels are very useful to all users, but getting them right is particularly important to users with disabilities.

You should make sure that your button and link text labels are understandable and distinctive. Don't just use "Click here" for your labels, as screen reader users sometimes get up a list of buttons and form controls. The following screenshot shows our controls being listed by VoiceOver on Mac.

![List of form input labels being listed by VoiceOver software on Mac. This list contains meaningless labels like 'happy menu button` given to various form controls like button, textfield and link](voiceover-formcontrols.png)

Make sure your labels make sense out of context, read on their own, as well as in the context of the paragraph they are in. For example, the following shows an example of good link text:

```html example-good
<p>
  Whales are really awesome creatures.
  <a href="whales.html">Find out more about whales</a>.
</p>
```

but this is bad link text:

```html example-bad
<p>
  Whales are really awesome creatures. To find out more about whales,
  <a href="whales.html">click here</a>.
</p>
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can find a lot more about link implementation and best practices in our [Creating links](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Creating_links) article. You can also see some good and bad examples at [good-links.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/html/good-links.html) and [bad-links.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/html/bad-links.html).

Form labels are also important for giving you a clue about what you need to enter into each form input. The following seems like a reasonable enough example:

```html example-bad
Fill in your name: <input type="text" id="name" name="name" />
```

However, this is not so useful for disabled users. There is nothing in the above example to associate the label unambiguously with the form input and make it clear how to fill it in if you cannot see it. If you access this with some screen readers, you may only be given a description along the lines of "edit text."

The following is a much better example:

```html example-good
<div>
  <label for="name">Fill in your name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" />
</div>
```

With code like this, the label will be clearly associated with the input; the description will be more like "Fill in your name: edit text."

![A good form label that reads 'Fill in your name' is given to a text input form control. ](voiceover-good-form-label.png)

As an added bonus, in most browsers associating a label with a form input means that you can click the label to select or activate the form element. This gives the input a bigger hit area, making it easier to select.

> [!NOTE]
> You can see some good and bad form examples in [good-form.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/html/good-form.html) and [bad-form.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/html/bad-form.html).

You can find a nice explanation of the importance of proper text labels, and how to investigate text label issues using the [Firefox Accessibility Inspector](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/accessibility_inspector/index.html), in the following video:

## Accessible data tables

A basic data table can be written with very simple markup, for example:

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Name</td>
    <td>Age</td>
    <td>Pronouns</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Gabriel</td>
    <td>13</td>
    <td>he/him</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Elva</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>she/her</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Freida</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>she/her</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

But this has problems — there is no way for a screen reader user to associate rows or columns together as groupings of data. To do this, you need to know what the header rows are and if they are heading up rows, columns, etc. This can only be done visually for the above table (see [bad-table.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/html/bad-table.html) and try the example out yourself).

Now have a look at our [punk bands table example](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/css/styling-boxes/styling-tables/punk-bands-complete.html) — you can see a few accessibility aids at work here:

- Table headers are defined using {{htmlelement("th")}} elements — you can also specify if they are headers for rows or columns using the `scope` attribute. This gives you complete groups of data that can be consumed by screen readers as single units.
- The {{htmlelement("caption")}} element and the `<table>` element's `summary` attribute both do similar jobs — they act as alt text for a table, giving a screen reader user a useful quick summary of the table's contents. The `<caption>` element is generally preferred as it makes its content accessible to sighted users too, who might also find it useful. You don't really need both.

> [!NOTE]
> See our [HTML table accessibility](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Table_accessibility) article for more details about accessible data tables.

## Text alternatives

Whereas textual content is inherently accessible, the same cannot necessarily be said for multimedia content — image and video content cannot be seen by visually-impaired people, and audio content cannot be heard by hearing-impaired people. We cover video and audio content in detail in the [Accessible multimedia](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/Multimedia), but for this article we'll look at accessibility for the humble {{htmlelement("img")}} element.

We have a simple example written up, [accessible-image.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/html/accessible-image.html), which features four copies of the same image:

```html
<img src="dinosaur.png" />

<img
  src="dinosaur.png"
  alt="A red Tyrannosaurus Rex: A two legged dinosaur standing upright like a human, with small arms, and a large head with lots of sharp teeth." />

<img
  src="dinosaur.png"
  alt="A red Tyrannosaurus Rex: A two legged dinosaur standing upright like a human, with small arms, and a large head with lots of sharp teeth."
  title="The Mozilla red dinosaur" />

<img src="dinosaur.png" aria-labelledby="dino-label" />

<p id="dino-label">
  The Mozilla red Tyrannosaurus Rex: A two legged dinosaur standing upright like
  a human, with small arms, and a large head with lots of sharp teeth.
</p>
```

The first image, when viewed by a screen reader, doesn't really offer the user much help — VoiceOver for example reads out "/dinosaur.png, image". It reads out the filename to try to provide some help. In this example the user will at least know it is a dinosaur of some kind, but often files may be uploaded with machine-generated file names (e.g., from a digital camera) and these file names would likely provide no context to the image's content.

> [!NOTE]
> This is why you should never include text content inside an image — screen readers can't access it. There are other disadvantages too — you can't select it and copy/paste it. Just don't do it!

When a screen reader encounters the second image, it reads out the full alt attribute — "A red Tyrannosaurus Rex: A two legged dinosaur standing upright like a human, with small arms, and a large head with lots of sharp teeth.".

This highlights the importance of not only using meaningful file names in case so-called **alt text** is not available, but also making sure that alt text is provided in `alt` attributes wherever possible.

Note that the contents of the `alt` attribute should always provide a direct representation of the image and what it conveys visually. The alt should be brief and concise and include all the information conveyed in the image that is not duplicated in the surrounding text.

The content of the `alt` attribute for a single image differs based on the context. For example, if the photo of Fluffy is an avatar next to a review for Yuckymeat dog food, `alt="Fluffy"` is appropriate. If the photo is part of Fluffy's adoption page for the animal rescue society, information conveyed in the image that is relevant for a prospective dog parent that is not duplicated in the surrounding text should be included. A longer description, such as `alt="Fluffy, a tri-color terrier with very short hair, with a tennis ball in her mouth."` is appropriate. As the surrounding text likely has Fluffy's size and breed, that is not included in the `alt`. However, as the dog's biography likely doesn't include hair length, colors, or toy preferences, which the potential parent needs to know, it is included. Is the image outdoors, or does Fluffy have a red collar with a blue leash? Not important in terms of adopting the pet and therefore not included. All information image conveys that a sighted user can access and is relevant to the context is what needs to be conveyed; nothing more. Keep it short, precise, and useful.

Any personal knowledge or extra description shouldn't be included here, as it is not useful for people who have not seen the image before. If the ball is Fluffy's favorite toy or if a sighted user can't know that from the image, then don't include it.

One thing to consider is whether your images have meaning inside your content, or whether they are purely for visual decoration, and thus have no meaning. If they are decorative, it is better to write an empty text as a value for `alt` attribute (see [Empty alt attributes](#empty_alt_attributes)) or to just include them in the page as CSS background images.

> [!NOTE]
> Read [HTML images](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/HTML_images) and [Responsive images](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Responsive_images) for a lot more information about image implementation and best practices.
> You can also check [An alt Decision Tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/) to learn how to use an alt attribute for images in various situations.

If you do want to provide extra contextual information, you should put it in the text surrounding the image, or inside a `title` attribute, as shown above. In this case, most screen readers will read out the alt text, the title attribute, and the filename. In addition, browsers display title text as tooltips when moused over.

![Screenshot of a red Tyrannosaurus Rex with the text "The mozilla red dinosaur" displayed as tooltip on mouseover.](title-attribute.png)

Let's have another quick look at the fourth method:

```html
<img src="dinosaur.png" aria-labelledby="dino-label" />

<p id="dino-label">The Mozilla red Tyrannosaurus…</p>
```

In this case, we are not using the `alt` attribute at all — instead, we have presented our description of the image as a regular text paragraph, given it an `id`, and then used the `aria-labelledby` attribute to refer to that `id`, which causes screen readers to use that paragraph as the alt text/label for that image. This is especially useful if you want to use the same text as a label for multiple images — something that isn't possible with `alt`.

> [!NOTE]
> [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) is part of the [WAI-ARIA](https://w3c.github.io/aria/) spec, which allows developers to add in extra semantics to their markup to improve screen reader accessibility where needed.

### Figures and figure captions

HTML includes two elements — {{htmlelement("figure")}} and {{htmlelement("figcaption")}} — which associate a figure of some kind (it could be anything, not necessarily an image) with a figure caption:

```html
<figure>
  <img
    src="dinosaur.png"
    alt="The Mozilla Tyrannosaurus"
    aria-describedby="dinodescr" />
  <figcaption id="dinodescr">
    A red Tyrannosaurus Rex: A two legged dinosaur standing upright like a
    human, with small arms, and a large head with lots of sharp teeth.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
```

While there is mixed screen reader support of associating figure captions with their figures, including [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) or [`aria-describedby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-describedby) creates the association if none is present. That said, the element structure is useful for CSS styling, plus it provides a way to place a description of the image next to it in the source.

### Empty alt attributes

```html
<h3>
  <img src="article-icon.png" alt="" />
  Tyrannosaurus Rex: the king of the dinosaurs
</h3>
```

There may be times where an image is included in a page's design, but its primary purpose is for visual decoration. You'll notice in the code example above that the image's `alt` attribute is empty — this is to make screen readers recognize the image, but not attempt to describe the image (instead they'd just say "image", or similar).

The reason to use an empty `alt` instead of not including it is because many screen readers announce the whole image URL if no `alt` is provided. In the above example, the image is acting as a visual decoration to the heading it's associated with. In cases like this, and in cases where an image is only decoration and has no content value, you should include an empty `alt` in your `img` elements. Another alternative is to use the aria [`role`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles) attribute [`role="presentation"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/presentation_role) as this also stops screen readers from reading out alternative text.

> [!NOTE]
> If possible you should use CSS to display images that are only decorative.

## More on links

Links (the [`<a>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/a) element with an `href` attribute), depending on how they are used, can help or harm accessibility. By default, links are accessible in appearance. They can improve accessibility by helping a user quickly navigate to different sections of a document. They can also harm accessibility if their accessible styling is removed or if JavaScript causes them to behave in unexpected ways.

### Link styling

By default, links are visually different from other text in both color and [text-decoration](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration), with links being blue and underlined by default, purple and underlined if visited, and with a [focus-ring](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus) when they receive keyboard focus.

Color should not be used as the sole method of distinguishing links from non-linking content. Link text color, like all text, has to be significantly different from the background color ([a 4.5:1 contrast](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Guides/Understanding_WCAG/Perceivable/Color_contrast)). In addition, links should visually be significantly different from non-linking text, with a minimum contrast requirement of 3:1 between link text and surrounding text and between default, visited, and focus/active states and a 4.5:1 contrast between all those state colors and the background color.

### `onclick` events

Anchor tags are often abused with the `onclick` event to create pseudo-buttons by setting **href** to `"#"` or `"javascript:void(0)"` to prevent the page from refreshing.

These values cause unexpected behavior when copying or dragging links, opening links in a new tab or window, bookmarking, and when JavaScript is still downloading, errors out, or is disabled. This also conveys incorrect semantics to assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers). In these cases, it is recommended to use a {{HTMLElement("button")}} instead. In general you should only use an anchor for navigation using a proper URL.

### External links and linking to non-HTML resources

Links that open in a new tab or window via the `target="_blank"` declaration and links to whose `href` value points to a file resource should include an indicator about the behavior that will occur when the link is activated.

People experiencing low vision conditions, who are navigating with the aid of screen reading technology, or who have cognitive concerns may become confused when the new tab, window, or application is opened unexpectedly. Older versions of screen reading software may not even announce the behavior.

#### Link that opens a new tab or window

```html
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikipedia.org/"
  >Wikipedia (opens in a new window)</a
>
```

#### Link to a non-HTML resource

```html
<a target="_blank" href="2017-annual-report.ppt"
  >2017 Annual Report (PowerPoint)</a
>
```

If an icon is used in place of text to signify this kind of links behavior, make sure it includes an [alternate description](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/img#alt).

### Skip links

A skip link, also known as skipnav, is an `a` element placed as close as possible to the opening {{HTMLElement("body")}} element that links to the beginning of the page's main content. This link allows people to bypass content repeated throughout multiple pages on a website, such as a website's header and primary navigation.

Skip links are especially useful for people who navigate with the aid of assistive technology such as switch control, voice command, or mouth sticks/head wands, where the act of moving through repetitive links can be a laborious task.

- [Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.1 | W3C Understanding WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-skip.html)

### Proximity

Large amounts of interactive content—including anchors—placed in close visual proximity to each other should have space inserted to separate them. This spacing is beneficial for people who suffer from fine motor control issues and may accidentally activate the wrong interactive content while navigating.

Spacing may be created using CSS properties such as {{CSSxRef("margin")}}.

# Accessibility on the web

{{NextMenu("Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/What_is_accessibility", "Learn_web_development/Core")}}

Access to web content such as public services, education, e-commerce sites, and entertainment is a human right. No one should be excluded based on disability, race, geography, or other human characteristics. This module discusses the best practices and techniques you should learn to make your websites as accessible as possible.

## Prerequisites

You should be familiar with [HTML](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content), [CSS](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics), and [JavaScript](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting) before starting this module.

- [Accessibility tooling and assistive technology](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/Tooling)
  - : Next we turn our attention to accessibility tooling, providing information on the kinds of tools you can use to help solve accessibility issues, and the assistive technologies used by people with disabilities as they browse the web. You'll be using these tools throughout subsequent articles.
- [HTML: A good basis for accessibility](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/HTML)
  - : A great deal of web content can be made accessible just by making sure the correct HTML elements are always used for the correct purpose. This article looks in detail at how HTML can be used to ensure maximum accessibility.
- [CSS and JavaScript accessibility best practices](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/CSS_and_JavaScript)
  - : CSS and JavaScript, when used properly, also have the potential to allow for accessible web experiences, but if misused they can significantly harm accessibility. This article outlines some CSS and JavaScript best practices that should be considered to ensure that even complex content is as accessible as possible.
- [WAI-ARIA basics](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/WAI-ARIA_basics)

## Accessibility on mobile devices

The state of accessibility — and support for web standards in general — is good in modern mobile devices. Long gone are the days when mobile devices ran completely different web technologies to desktop browsers, forcing developers to use browser sniffing and serve them completely separate sites (although quite a few companies still detect usage of mobile devices and serve them a separate mobile domain).

These days, mobile devices can usually handle fully-featured websites, and the main platforms even have screen readers built in to enable visually impaired users to use them successfully. Modern mobile browsers tend to have good support for [WAI-ARIA](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/WAI-ARIA_basics), too.

To make a website accessible and usable on mobile, you just need to follow general good web design and accessibility best practices.

There are some exceptions that need special consideration for mobile; the main ones are:

- Control mechanisms — Make sure interface controls such as buttons are accessible on mobiles (i.e., mainly touchscreen), as well as desktops/laptops (mainly mouse/keyboard).
- User input — Make user input requirements as painless as possible on mobile (e.g., in forms, keep typing to a minimum).
- Responsive design — Make sure layouts work on mobile, conserve image download sizes, and think about the provision of images for high-resolution screens.

## Summary of screen reader testing on Android and iOS

The most common mobile platforms have fully functional screen readers. These function in much the same way as desktop screen readers, except they are largely operated using touch gestures rather than key combinations.

Let's look at the main two: TalkBack on Android and VoiceOver on iOS.

### Android TalkBack

The TalkBack screen reader is built into the Android operating system.

To turn it on, look up what phone model and Android version you have, and then look up where the TalkBack menu is. It tends to differ widely between Android versions and even between different phone models. Some phone manufacturers (e.g., Samsung) don't even have TalkBack in newer phones, and instead opted for their own screen reader.

When you've found the TalkBack menu, press the slider switch to turn TalkBack on. Follow any additional on-screen prompts that you are presented with.

When TalkBack is turned on, your Android device's basic controls will be a bit different. For example:

1. Single-tapping an app will select it, and the device will read out what the app is.
2. Swiping left and right will move between apps, or buttons/controls if you are in a control bar. The device will read out each option.
3. Double-tapping anywhere will open the app/select the option.
4. You can also "explore by touch" — hold your finger down on the screen and drag it around, and your device will read out the different apps/items you move across.

If you want to turn TalkBack off:

1. Navigate back to the TalkBack menu screen (using the different gestures that are currently enabled.)
2. Navigate to the slider switch and activate it to turn it off.

> [!NOTE]
> You can get to your home screen at any time by swiping up and left in a smooth motion. If you have more than one home screen, you can move between them by swiping two fingers left and right.

For a more complete list of TalkBack gestures, see [Use TalkBack gestures](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6151827).

#### Unlocking the phone

When TalkBack is turned on, unlocking the phone is a bit different.

You can do a two-finger swipe up from the bottom of the lock screen. If you've set a passcode or pattern for unlocking your device, you will then be taken to the relevant entry screen to enter it.

You can also explore by touch to find the _Unlock_ button at the bottom middle of the screen, and then double-tap.

#### Global and local menus

TalkBack allows you to access global and local context menus, wherever you have navigated on the device. The former provides global options relating to the device as a whole, and the latter provides options relating just to the current app/screen you are in.

To get to these menus:

1. Access the global menu by quickly swiping down, and then right.
2. Access the local menu by quickly swiping up, and then right.
3. Swipe left and right to cycle between the different options.
4. Once you've selected the option you want, double-tap to choose that option.

For details on all the options available under the global and local context menus, see [Use global and local context menus](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6007066).

#### Browsing web pages

You can use the local context menu while in a web browser to find options to navigate web pages using just the headings, form controls, or links, or navigate line by line, etc.

For example, with TalkBack turned on:

1. Open your web browser.
2. Activate the URL bar.
3. Enter a web page that has a bunch of headings on it, such as the front page of bbc.co.uk. To enter the text of the URL:
   - Select the URL bar by swiping left/right till you get to it, and then double-tapping.
   - Hold your finger down on the virtual keyboard until you get the character you want, and then release your finger to type it. Repeat for each character.
   - Once you've finished, find the Enter key and press it.

4. Swipe left and right to move between different items on the page.
5. Swipe up and right with a smooth motion to enter the local content menu.
6. Swipe right until you find the "Headings and Landmarks" option.
7. Double-tap to select it. Now you'll be able to swipe left and right to move between headings and ARIA landmarks.
8. To go back to the default mode, enter the local context menu again by swiping up and right, select "Default", and then double-tap to activate.

### iOS VoiceOver

A mobile version of VoiceOver is built into the iOS operating system.

To turn it on, go to Your _Settings_ app and select _Accessibility > VoiceOver_. Press the _VoiceOver_ slider to enable it (you'll also see several other options related to VoiceOver on this page).

> [!NOTE]
> Some older iOS devices have the VoiceOver menu at _Settings app_ > _General_ > _Accessibility_ > _VoiceOver_.

Once VoiceOver is enabled, iOS's basic control gestures will be a bit different:

1. A single tap will cause the item you tap on to be selected; your device will speak the item you've tapped on.
2. You can also navigate the items on the screen by swiping left and right to move between them, or by sliding your finger around on the screen to move between different items (when you find the item you want, you can remove your finger to select it).
3. To activate the selected item (e.g., open a selected app), double-tap anywhere on the screen.
4. Swipe with three fingers to scroll through a page.
5. Tap with two fingers to perform a context-relevant action — for example, taking a photo while in the camera app.

To turn it off again, navigate back to _Settings > General > Accessibility > VoiceOver_ using the above gestures, and toggle the _VoiceOver_ slider back to off.

#### Unlock phone

To unlock the phone, you need to press the home button (or swipe) as normal. If you have a passcode set, you can select each number by swiping/sliding (as explained above) and then double-tapping to enter each number when you've found the right one.

#### Using the Rotor

When VoiceOver is turned on, you have a navigation feature called the Rotor available to you, which allows you to quickly choose from a number of common useful options. To use it:

1. Twist two fingers around on the screen like you are turning a dial. Each option will be read aloud as you twist further around. You can go back and forth to cycle through the options.
2. Once you've found the option you want:
   - Release your fingers to select it.
   - If it is an option you can iterate the value of (such as Volume or Speaking Rate), you can do a swipe up or down to increase or decrease the value of the selected item.

The options available under the Rotor are context-sensitive — they will differ depending on what app or view you are in (see below for an example).

#### Browsing web pages

Let's have a go at web browsing with VoiceOver:

1. Open your web browser.
2. Activate the URL bar.
3. Enter a web page that has a bunch of headings on it, such as the front page of bbc.co.uk. To enter the text of the URL:
   - Select the URL bar by swiping left/right until you get to it, and then double-tapping.
   - For each character, hold your finger down on the virtual keyboard until you get the character you want, and then release your finger to select it. Double-tap to type it.
   - Once you've finished, find the Enter key and press it.

4. Swipe left and right to move between items on the page. You can double-tap an item to select it (e.g., follow a link).
5. By default, the selected Rotor option will be Speaking Rate; you can currently swipe up and down to increase or decrease the speaking rate.
6. Now turn two fingers around the screen like a dial to show the rotor and move between its options. Here are a few examples of the options available:
   - _Speaking Rate_: Change the speaking rate.
   - _Containers_: Move between different semantic containers on the page.
   - _Headings_: Move between headings on the page.
   - _Links_: Move between links on the page.
   - _Form Controls_: Move between form controls on the page.
   - _Language_: Move between different translations, if they are available.

7. Select _Headings_. Now you'll be able to swipe up and down to move between headings on the page.

## Control mechanisms

In our CSS and JavaScript accessibility article, we looked at the idea of events that are specific to a certain type of control mechanism (see [Mouse-specific events](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/CSS_and_JavaScript#mouse-specific_events)). To recap, these cause accessibility issues because other control mechanisms can't activate the associated functionality.

As an example, the [click](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event) event is good in terms of accessibility — an associated event handler can be invoked by clicking the element the handler is set on, tabbing to it and pressing Enter/Return, or tapping it on a touchscreen device. Try our [simple-button-example.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/accessibility/mobile/simple-button-example.html) example ([see it running live](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/mobile/simple-button-example.html)) to see what we mean.

Alternatively, mouse-specific events such as [mousedown](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mousedown_event) and [mouseup](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mouseup_event) create problems — their event handlers cannot be invoked using non-mouse controls.

If you try to control our [simple-box-drag.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/accessibility/mobile/simple-box-drag.html) ([see example live](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/mobile/simple-box-drag.html)) example with a keyboard or touch, you'll see the problem. This occurs because we are using code such as the following:

```js
div.onmousedown = () => {
  initialBoxX = div.offsetLeft;
  initialBoxY = div.offsetTop;
  movePanel();
};

document.onmouseup = stopMove;
```

To enable other forms of control, you need to use different, yet equivalent events — for example, touch events work on touchscreen devices:

```js
div.ontouchstart = (e) => {
  initialBoxX = div.offsetLeft;
  initialBoxY = div.offsetTop;
  positionHandler(e);
  movePanel();
};

panel.ontouchend = stopMove;
```

We've provided a simple example that shows how to use the mouse and touch events together — see [multi-control-box-drag.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/accessibility/mobile/multi-control-box-drag.html) ([see the example live](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/mobile/multi-control-box-drag.html) also).

> [!NOTE]
> You can also see fully functional examples showing how to implement different control mechanisms at [Implementing game control mechanisms](/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/Control_mechanisms).

## Responsive design

[Responsive design](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design) is the practice of making your layouts and other features of your apps dynamically change depending on factors such as screen size and resolution, so they are usable and accessible to users of different device types.

In particular, the most common problems that need to be addressed for mobile are:

- Suitability of layouts for mobile devices. A multi-column layout won't work as well on a narrow screen, for example, and the text size may need to be increased so it is legible. Such issues can be solved by creating a responsive layout using technologies such as [media queries](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries), [viewport](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/name/viewport), and [flexbox](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Flexbox).
- Conserving image sizes downloaded. In general, small-screen devices won't need images that are as large as their desktop counterparts, and they are more likely to be on slow network connections. Therefore, it is wise to serve smaller images to narrow screen devices as appropriate. You can handle this using [responsive image techniques](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Responsive_images).
- Thinking about high resolutions. Many mobile devices have high-resolution screens, and therefore need higher-resolution images so that the display can continue to look crisp and sharp. Again, you can serve images as appropriate using responsive image techniques. In addition, many image requirements can be fulfilled using the SVG vector images format, which is well-supported across browsers today. SVG has a small file size and will stay sharp regardless of whatever size is being displayed (see [Including vector graphics in HTML](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Including_vector_graphics_in_HTML) for more details).

> [!NOTE]
> We won't provide a full discussion of responsive design techniques here, as they are covered in other places around MDN (see the above links).

### Specific mobile considerations

There are other important issues to consider when making sites more accessible on mobile. We have listed a couple here, but we will add more when we think of them.

#### Not disabling zoom

Using [viewport](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/name/viewport), it is possible to disable zoom. Always ensure resizing is enabled, and set the width to the device's width in the {{htmlelement("head")}}:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width; user-scalable=yes" />
```

You should never set `user-scalable=no` if at all possible — many people rely on zoom to be able to see the content of your website, so taking this functionality away is a really bad idea. There are certain situations where zooming might break the UI; in such cases, if you feel that you need to disable zoom, you should provide some other kind of equivalent, such as a control for increasing the text size in a way that doesn't break your UI.

#### Keeping menus accessible

Because the screen is so much narrower on mobile devices, it is very common to use media queries and other technologies to make the navigation menu shrink down to a tiny icon at the top of the display — which can be pressed to reveal the menu only if it's needed — when the site is viewed on mobile. This is commonly represented by a "three horizontal lines" icon, and the design pattern is consequently known as a "hamburger menu".

When implementing such a menu, you need to make sure that the control to reveal it is accessible by appropriate control mechanisms (normally touch for mobile), as discussed in [Control mechanisms](#control_mechanisms) above, and that the rest of the page is moved out of the way or hidden in some way while the menu is being accessed, to avoid confusion with navigating it.

Click here for a [good hamburger menu example](https://fritz-weisshart.de/meg_men/).

## User input

On mobile devices, inputting data tends to be more annoying for users than the equivalent experience on desktop computers. It is more convenient to type text into form inputs using a desktop or laptop keyboard than a touchscreen virtual keyboard or a tiny mobile physical keyboard.

For this reason, it is worth trying to minimize the amount of typing needed. As an example, instead of getting users to fill out their job title each time using a regular text input, you could instead offer a {{htmlelement("select")}} menu containing the most common options (which also helps with consistency in data entry) and offer an "Other" option that displays a text field to type any outliers into. You can see a simple example of this idea in action in [common-job-types.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/accessibility/mobile/common-job-types.html) (see the [common jobs example live](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/mobile/common-job-types.html)).

It is also worth considering the use of HTML form input types such as the date on mobile platforms as they handle them well — both Android and iOS, for example, display usable widgets that fit well with the device experience. See [html5-form-examples.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/accessibility/mobile/html5-form-examples.html) for some examples (see the [HTML5 form examples live](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/mobile/html5-form-examples.html)) — try loading these and manipulating them on mobile devices. For example:

- Types `number`, `tel`, and `email` display suitable virtual keyboards for entering numbers/telephone numbers.
- Types `time` and `date` display suitable pickers for selecting times and dates.

If you want to provide a different solution for desktops, you could always serve different markup to your mobile devices using feature detection. Check out our [feature detection article](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Testing/Feature_detection) for more information.

# Accessible multimedia

{{PreviousMenuNext("Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/Test_your_skills/WAI-ARIA","Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/Mobile", "Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility")}}

Another category of content that can create accessibility problems is multimedia. Video, audio, and image content need to be given proper textual alternatives so that they can be understood by assistive technologies and their users. This article shows how.

## Multimedia and accessibility

So far in this module, we have looked at a variety of content and what needs to be done to ensure its accessibility, ranging from simple text content to data tables, images, native controls such as form elements and buttons, and even more complex markup structures (with [WAI-ARIA](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/WAI-ARIA_basics) attributes).

This article on the other hand looks at another general class of content that arguably isn't as easy to ensure accessibility for — multimedia. Images, audio tracks, videos, {{htmlelement("canvas")}} elements, etc., aren't as easily understood by screen readers or navigated by the keyboard, and we need to give them a helping hand.

But don't despair — here we will help you navigate through the techniques available for making multimedia more accessible.

## Simple images

We already covered simple text alternatives for HTML images in our [HTML: A good basis for accessibility](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/HTML) article — you can refer back to there for the full details. In short, you should ensure that where possible visual content has an alternative text available for screen readers to pick up and read to their users.

For example:

```html
<img
  src="dinosaur.png"
  alt="A red Tyrannosaurus Rex: A two legged dinosaur standing upright like a human, with small arms, and a large head with lots of sharp teeth." />
```

## Accessible audio and video controls

Implementing controls for web-based audio/video shouldn't be a problem, right? Let's investigate.

### The problem with native HTML controls

HTML video and audio instances even come with a set of inbuilt controls that allow you to control the media straight out of the box. For example (see `native-controls.html` [source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/accessibility/multimedia/native-controls.html) and [live](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/multimedia/native-controls.html)):

```html
<audio controls>
  <source src="viper.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
  <source src="viper.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
  <p>
    Your browser doesn't support HTML audio. Here is a
    <a href="viper.mp3">link to the audio</a> instead.
  </p>
</audio>

<br />

<video controls>
  <source src="rabbit320.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="rabbit320.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <p>
    Your browser doesn't support HTML video. Here is a
    <a href="rabbit320.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.
  </p>
</video>
```

The controls attribute provides play/pause buttons, seek bar, etc. — the basic controls you'd expect from a media player. It looks like so in Firefox and Chrome:

![Screenshot of Video Controls in Firefox](native-controls-firefox.png)

![Screenshot of Video Controls in Chrome](native-controls-chrome.png)

However, there are problems with these controls:

- They are not keyboard-accessible in most browsers, i.e., you can't tab between the controls inside the native player. Opera and Chrome provide this to some degree, but it still isn't ideal.
- Different browsers give the native controls differing styling and functionality, and they aren't stylable, meaning that they can't be easily made to follow a site style guide.

To remedy this, we can create our own custom controls. Let's look at how.

### Creating custom audio and video controls

HTML video and audio share an API — HTML Media Element — which allows you to map custom functionality to buttons and other controls — both of which you define yourself.

Let's take the video example from above and add custom controls to them.

#### Basic setup

First, grab a copy of our [custom-controls-start.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/accessibility/multimedia/custom-controls-start.html), [custom-controls.css](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/accessibility/multimedia/custom-controls.css), [rabbit320.mp4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/learning-area/master/accessibility/multimedia/rabbit320.mp4), and [rabbit320.webm](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/learning-area/master/accessibility/multimedia/rabbit320.webm) files and save them in a new directory on your hard drive.

Create a new file called main.js and save it in the same directory.

First of all, let's look at the HTML for the video player, in the HTML:

```html
<section class="player">
  <video controls>
    <source src="rabbit320.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    <source src="rabbit320.webm" type="video/webm" />
    <p>
      Your browser doesn't support HTML video. Here is a
      <a href="rabbit320.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.
    </p>
  </video>

  <div class="controls">
    <button class="play-pause">Play</button>
    <button class="stop">Stop</button>
    <button class="rwd">Rwd</button>
    <button class="fwd">Fwd</button>
    <div class="time">00:00</div>
  </div>
</section>
```

#### JavaScript basic setup

We've inserted some simple control buttons below our video. These controls of course won't do anything by default; to add functionality, we will use JavaScript.

We will first need to store references to each of the controls — add the following to the top of your JavaScript file:

```js
const playPauseBtn = document.querySelector(".play-pause");
const stopBtn = document.querySelector(".stop");
const rwdBtn = document.querySelector(".rwd");
const fwdBtn = document.querySelector(".fwd");
const timeLabel = document.querySelector(".time");
```

Next, we need to grab a reference to the video/audio player itself — add this line below the previous lines:

```js
const player = document.querySelector("video");
```

This holds a reference to a {{domxref("HTMLMediaElement")}} object, which has several useful properties and methods available on it that can be used to wire up functionality to our buttons.

Before moving on to creating our button functionality, let's remove the native controls so they don't get in the way of our custom controls. Add the following, again at the bottom of your JavaScript:

```js
player.removeAttribute("controls");
```

Doing it this way round rather than just not including the controls attribute in the first place has the advantage that if our JavaScript fails for any reason, the user still has some controls available.

#### Wiring up our buttons

First, let's set up the play/pause button. We can get this to toggle between play and pause with a simple conditional function, like the following. Add it to your code, at the bottom:

```js
playPauseBtn.onclick = () => {
  if (player.paused) {
    player.play();
    playPauseBtn.textContent = "Pause";
  } else {
    player.pause();
    playPauseBtn.textContent = "Play";
  }
};
```

Next, add this code to the bottom, which controls the stop button:

```js
stopBtn.onclick = () => {
  player.pause();
  player.currentTime = 0;
  playPauseBtn.textContent = "Play";
};
```

There is no `stop()` function available on {{domxref("HTMLMediaElement")}}s, so instead we `pause()` it, and at the same time set the `currentTime` to 0.

Next, our rewind and fast-forward buttons — add the following blocks to the bottom of your code:

```js
rwdBtn.onclick = () => {
  player.currentTime -= 3;
};

fwdBtn.onclick = () => {
  player.currentTime += 3;
  if (player.currentTime >= player.duration || player.paused) {
    player.pause();
    player.currentTime = 0;
    playPauseBtn.textContent = "Play";
  }
};
```

These are very simple, just adding or subtracting 3 seconds to the `currentTime` each time they are clicked. In a real video player, you'd probably want a more elaborate seeking bar, or similar.

Note that we also check to see if the `currentTime` is more than the total media `duration` or if the media is not playing when the `fwdBtn` is pressed. If either condition is true, we stop the video to avoid the user interface going wrong if they attempt to fast forward when the video is not playing or fast forward past the end of the video.

Last of all, add the following to the end of the code, to control the time elapsed display:

```js
player.ontimeupdate = () => {
  const minutes = Math.floor(player.currentTime / 60);
  const seconds = Math.floor(player.currentTime - minutes * 60);
  const minuteValue = minutes < 10 ? `0${minutes}` : minutes;
  const secondValue = seconds < 10 ? `0${seconds}` : seconds;

  const mediaTime = `${minuteValue}:${secondValue}`;
  timeLabel.textContent = mediaTime;
};
```

Each time the time updates (once per second), we fire this function. It works out the number of minutes and seconds from the given currentTime value (which is in seconds), adds a leading 0 if either the minute or second value is less than 10, and then creates the display readout and adds it to the time label.

#### Further reading

This gives you a basic idea of how to add custom player functionality to video/audio player instances. For more information on how to add more complex features to video/audio players, see:

- [Audio and video delivery](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Audio_and_video_delivery)
- [Video player styling basics](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Audio_and_video_delivery/Video_player_styling_basics)
- [Creating a cross-browser video player](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Audio_and_video_delivery/cross_browser_video_player)

We've also created an advanced example to show how you could create an object-oriented system that finds every video and audio player on the page (no matter how many there are) and adds our custom controls to it. See [custom-controls-oojs](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/multimedia/custom-controls-OOJS/) (also [see the source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/tree/main/accessibility/multimedia/custom-controls-OOJS)).

## Audio transcripts

To provide deaf people with access to audio content, you need to create text transcripts. These can either be included on the same page as the audio in some way or included on a separate page and linked to.

In terms of actually creating the transcript, your options are:

- Commercial services — You could pay a professional to do the transcription, see for example companies like [Scribie](https://scribie.com/), [Casting Words](https://castingwords.com/), or [Rev](https://www.rev.com/). Look around and ask for advice to make sure you find a reputable company that you'll be able to work with effectively.
- Community/grassroots/self transcription — If you are part of an active community or team in your workplace, then you could ask them for help with doing the translations. You could even have a go at doing them yourself.
- Automated services — There are AI services available, like [Trint](https://trint.com/) or [Transcribear](https://transcribear.com/). Upload a video/audio file to the site, and it automatically transcribes it for you. On YouTube, you can choose to generate automated captions/transcripts. Depending on how clear the spoken audio is, the resulting transcript quality will vary greatly.

As with most things in life, you tend to get what you pay for; different services will vary in accuracy and time taken to produce the transcript. If you pay a reputable company or AI service to do the transcription, you will probably get it done rapidly and to a high quality. If you don't want to pay for it, you are likely to get it done at a lower quality, and/or slowly.

It is not OK to publish an audio resource but promise to publish the transcript later on — such promises often aren't kept, which will erode trust between you and your users. If the audio you are presenting is something like a face to face meeting or live spoken performance, it would be acceptable to take notes during the performance, publish them in full along with the audio, then seek help in cleaning up the notes afterward.

### Transcript examples

If you use an automated service, then you'll probably have to use the user interface that the tool provides. For example, take a look at our [Wait, ARIA Roles Have Categories?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwF-PpJOjMs) video and choose the three-dot menu (. . .) _> Show Transcript_. You'll see the transcript come up in a separate panel.

If you are creating your own user interface to present your audio and associated transcript, you can do it however you like, but it might make sense to include it in a showable/hidable panel; see our [audio-transcript-ui](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/multimedia/audio-transcript-ui/) example (also see the [source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/tree/main/accessibility/multimedia/audio-transcript-ui)).

### Audio descriptions

On occasions where visuals are accompanying your audio, you'll need to provide audio descriptions of some kind to describe that extra content.

In many cases, this will take the form of video, in which case you can implement captions using the techniques described in the next section of the article.

However, there are some edge cases. You might for example have an audio recording of a meeting that refers to an accompanying resource such as a spreadsheet or chart. In such cases, you should make sure that the resources are provided along with the audio + transcript, and specifically link to them in the places where they are referred to in the transcript. This of course will help all users, not just people who are deaf.

> [!NOTE]
> An audio transcript will in general help multiple user groups. As well as giving deaf users access to the information contained in the audio, think about a user with a low bandwidth connection, who would find downloading the audio inconvenient. Think also about a user in a noisy environment like a pub or bar, who is trying to access the information but can't hear it over the noise.

## Video text tracks

To make video accessible for the deaf, visually impaired, or other groups of users (such as those on low bandwidth, or who don't understand the language the video is recorded in), you need to include text tracks along with your video content.

> [!NOTE]
> Text tracks are also useful for potentially any user, not just those with disabilities. For example, some users may not be able to hear the audio because they are in noisy environments (like a crowded bar when a sports game is being shown) or might not want to disturb others if they are in a quiet place (like a library).

This is not a new concept — television services have had closed captioning available for quite a long time:

![Frame from an old-timey cartoon with closed captioning "Good work, Goldie. Keep it up!"](closed-captions.png)

Many countries offer English films with subtitles written in their own native languages, and different language subtitles are often available on DVDs, as shown below:

![An English film with German subtitles "Emo, warum erkennst du nicht die Schonheit dieses Ortes?"](subtitles_german.png)

There are different types of text tracks for different purposes. The main ones you'll come across are:

- Captions — There for the benefit of deaf users who can't hear the audio track, including the words being spoken, and contextual information such as who spoke the words, if the people were angry or sad, and what mood the music is currently creating.
- Subtitles — Include translations of the audio dialog, for users that don't understand the language being spoken.
- Descriptions — These include descriptions for visually impaired people who can't see the video, for example, what the scene looks like.
- Chapter titles — Chapter markers intended to help the user navigate the media resource

### Implementing HTML video text tracks

Text tracks for displaying with HTML video need to be written in WebVTT, a text format containing multiple strings of text along with metadata such as what time in the video you want each text string to be displayed, and even limited styling/positioning information. These text strings are called cues.

A typical WebVTT file will look something like this:

```plain
WEBVTT

1
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.606
This is the first subtitle.

2
00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.074
This is the second.

…
```

To get this displayed along with the HTML media playback, you need to:

- Save it as a .vtt file in a sensible place.
- Link to the .vtt file with the {{htmlelement("track")}} element. `<track>` should be placed within `<audio>` or `<video>`, but after all `<source>` elements. Use the [`kind`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/track#kind) attribute to specify whether the cues are subtitles, captions, or descriptions. Furthermore, use [`srclang`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/track#srclang) to tell the browser what language you have written the subtitles in.

Here's an example:

```html
<video controls>
  <source src="example.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="example.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <track kind="subtitles" src="subtitles_en.vtt" srclang="en" />
</video>
```

This will result in a video that has subtitles displayed. For a full-fledged application and its source code, see [Adding captions and subtitles to HTML video](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Audio_and_video_delivery/Adding_captions_and_subtitles_to_HTML5_video). This example uses JavaScript to allow users to choose between different subtitles. Note that to turn the subtitles on, you need to press the "CC" button and select an option — English, Deutsch, or Español.

> [!NOTE]
> Text tracks and transcriptions also help you with {{glossary("SEO")}}, since search engines especially thrive on text. Text tracks even allow search engines to link directly to a spot partway through the video.

## Summary

This chapter has provided a summary of accessibility concerns for multimedia content, along with some practical solutions.

It is not always easy to make multimedia accessible. If for example, you are dealing with an immersive 3D game or virtual reality app, it is quite difficult to provide text alternatives for such an experience, and you might argue that visually impaired users are not really in the target audience bracket for such apps.

You can however make sure that such an app has good enough color contrast and clear presentation so it is perceivable to those with low vision/color blindness, and also make it keyboard accessible. Remember that accessibility is about doing as much as you can, rather than striving for 100% accessibility all the time, which is often impossible.

{{PreviousMenuNext("Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/CSS_and_JavaScript","Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/WAI-ARIA_basics", "Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility")}}

The aim of this skill test is to help you assess whether you've understood our [CSS and JavaScript accessibility best practices](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/CSS_and_JavaScript) article.

> [!NOTE]
> To get help, read our [Test your skills](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development#test_your_skills) usage guide. You can also reach out to us using one of our [communication channels](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels).

## CSS accessibility 1

In the first task you are presented with a list of links. However, their accessibility is pretty bad — there is no way to really tell that they are links, or to tell which one the user is focused on. We'd like you to assume that the existing ruleset with the `a` selector is supplied by some CMS, and that you can't change it.

To complete the task, create new rules to make the links look and behave like links, and for the user to be able to tell which link they are focused on in the list.

<!-- Code shared across examples -->

```css hidden live-sample___css-js-ally-1 live-sample___css-js-ally-2 live-sample___css-js-ally-3
body {
  background-color: white;
  color: #333333;
  font:
    1em / 1.4 "Helvetica Neue",
    "Helvetica",
    "Arial",
    sans-serif;
  padding: 1em;
  margin: 0;
}

* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

<!-- Example-specific code -->

```html live-sample___css-js-ally-1
<ul>
  <li><a href="">Animals</a></li>
  <li><a href="">Computers</a></li>
  <li><a href="">Diversity and inclusion</a></li>
  <li><a href="">Food</a></li>
  <li><a href="">Medicine</a></li>
  <li><a href="">Music</a></li>
</ul>
```

```css live-sample___css-js-ally-1
a {
  text-decoration: none;
  color: #666666;
  outline: none;
}

/* Don't edit the above code! */

/* Add your code here */
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample("css-js-ally-1", "100%", 200) }}

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

Your finished CSS could look something like this:

```css
/* ... */
/* Don't edit the above code! */

li a {
  text-decoration: underline;
  color: rgb(150 0 0);
}

li a:hover,
li a:focus {
  text-decoration: none;
  color: red;
}
```

</details>

## CSS accessibility 2

In this next task you are presented with a simple bit of content — just headings and paragraphs. There are accessibility issues with the colors and sizing of the text, and we'd like you to fix them.

To complete the task:

1. Think about what the problems are, and which guidelines state the acceptable values for color and sizing.
2. Update the CSS with new values for the color and font-size to fix the problem.
3. Test the code to make sure the problem is now fixed. Explain what tools or methods you used to select the new values and test the code.

h2,
p {
  color: #999999;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 2vw;
}

h2 {
  font-size: 1.5vw;
}

p {
  font-size: 1.2vw;
}
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample("css-js-ally-2", "100%", 240) }}

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

1. The problems are:
   - The color contrast is not acceptable, as per WCAG criteria [1.4.3 (AA)](https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/#contrast-minimum) and [1.4.6 (AAA)](https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/#contrast-enhanced).
   - The text is sized using `vw` units, which means that it is not zoomable in most browsers. [WCAG 1.4.4 (AA)](https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/#resize-text) states that text should be resizable.
2. To fix the code, you need to
   - Choose a better contrasting set of background and foreground colors.
   - Use some different units to size the text (such as `rem` or even `px`), or even implement something that uses a combination of `vw` and other units, if you want it resizable but still relative to the viewport size.
3. For testing:
   - You can test color contrast using a tool such as [aXe](https://www.deque.com/axe/), The [Firefox Accessibility Inspector](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/accessibility_inspector/), or even a simple standalone web page tool like the [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).
   - For text resizing, you'd need to load the example in a browser and try to resize it. Resizing `vw` unit-sized text works in Safari, but not in Firefox or Chromium-based browsers.

For the updated code, something like this would fix the color contrast:

```css
main {
  padding: 20px;
  background-color: red;
}

h1,
h2,
p {
  color: black;
}
```

And something like this would work for the font sizing:

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 2.5rem;
}

h2 {
  font-size: 2rem;
}

p {
  font-size: 1.2rem;
}
```

Or this, if you want to do something a bit cleverer that gives you resizable viewport-relative text:

```css
h1 {
  font-size: calc(1.5vw + 1rem);
}

h2 {
  font-size: calc(1.2vw + 0.7rem);
}

p {
  font-size: calc(1vw + 0.4rem);
}
```

</details>

## JavaScript accessibility 1

In our final accessibility task, you have some JavaScripting to do. We have an app that presents a list of animal names. Clicking one of the animal names causes a further description of that animal to appear in a box below the list.

But it is not very accessible — in its current state you can only operate it with the mouse. We'd like you to add some HTML and JavaScript to make it keyboard accessible too.

```html live-sample___css-js-ally-3
<section class="preview">
  <div class="animal-list">
    <h1>Animal summaries</h1>

    <p>
      The following list of animals can be clicked to display a description of
      that animal.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li
        data-description="A type of wild mountain goat, with large recurved horns, found in Eurasia, North Africa, and East Africa.">
        Ibex
      </li>
      <li
        data-description="A medium-sized marine mammal, similar to a manatee, but with a Dolphin-like tail.">
        Dugong
      </li>
      <li
        data-description="A rare marsupial, which looks rather like a tiny kangaroo, measuring around 50 to 75 centimeters.">
        Quokka
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="animal-description">
    <h2></h2>

    <p></p>
  </div>
</section>
```

```css hidden live-sample___css-js-ally-3
p {
  color: purple;
  margin: 0.5em 0;
}

li {
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

```js live-sample___css-js-ally-3
const listItems = document.querySelectorAll("li");
const descHeading = document.querySelector(".animal-description h2");
const descPara = document.querySelector(".animal-description p");

listItems.forEach((item) => {
  item.addEventListener("mouseup", handleSelection);
});

function handleSelection(e) {
  const heading = e.target.textContent;
  const description = e.target.getAttribute("data-description");
  descHeading.textContent = heading;
  descPara.textContent = description;
}
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample("css-js-ally-3", "100%", 400) }}

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

1. To begin with, you'll need to add `tabindex="0"` to the list items to make them focusable via the keyboard.
2. Then you'll need to add in another event listener inside the `forEach()` loop, to make the code respond to keys being pressed while the list items are selected. It is probably a good idea to make it respond to a specific key, such as "Enter", in which case something like the following is probably acceptable:

```js
item.addEventListener("keyup", (e) => {
  if (e.key === "Enter") {
    handleSelection(e);
  }
});
```

## HTML accessibility 1

In this task we will test your understanding of semantic HTML, and why it is good for accessibility. The given text is an information panel with action buttons, but the HTML is really bad.

To complete the task, update the markup to use appropriate semantic HTML. You don't need to worry too much about recreating the _exact_ same look and text sizing, as long as the semantics are good.

<!-- Code shared across examples -->

```css hidden live-sample___html-ally-1 live-sample___html-ally-2 live-sample___html-ally-3 live-sample___html-ally-4

```

Bonus points for:

- Just using `<button>`, not `<button class="button">` (repeating semantics is unnecessary), and updating the CSS selector to make sure the button still picks up the styles.
- Using an unordered list, not an ordered list — the list of items doesn't really need to be in any order.

</details>

## HTML accessibility 2

In the second task, you have a form containing three input fields.

To complete the task:

1. Semantically associate the inputs with their labels.
2. Assume that these inputs will be part of a larger form, and wrap them in an element that associates them all together as a single related group.
3. Give the group a description/title that summarizes all of the information as personal data.

```html live-sample___html-ally-2
<form>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Name
      <input type="text" name="name" />
    </li>
    <li>
      Age
      <input type="number" name="age" />
    </li>
    <li>
      Email address
      <input type="email" name="email" />
    </li>
  </ul>
</form>
```

```css live-sample___html-ally-2
form {
  width: 400px;
}

li {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}
```

        <label for="name">Name</label>
        <input type="text" name="name" id="name" />
      </li>
      <li>
        <label for="age">Age</label>
        <input type="number" name="age" id="age" />

        <input type="email" name="email" id="email" />
      </li>
    </ul>
  </fieldset>
</form>
```

</details>

## HTML accessibility 3

In this task you are required to turn all the information links in the paragraph into good, accessible links.

- The first two links just go to regular web pages.
- The third link goes to a PDF, and it's large — 8MB.
- The fourth link goes to a Word document, so the user will need some kind of application installed that can handle that.

To complete the task, update the links appropriately based on the above descriptions.

```html-nolint live-sample___html-ally-3
<p>

   and assessment sheets
  (<a href="/resources/assessments.docx" target="_blank">click here</a>).
</p>
```

> [!NOTE]
> The links in the starting code have the `target="_blank"` attribute set on them, so that when you click on them, they try to open the linked pages in a new tab rather than the same tab. This is not strictly best practice, but we've done it here so that the pages don't open in the MDN Playground output `<iframe>`, getting rid of your example code in the process!

## HTML accessibility 4

In our final HTML accessibility task, you are given an image gallery, which has some accessibility problems. Can you fix them?

- The header image has an accessibility issue, and so do the gallery images.
- You could take the header image further and implement it using CSS for arguably better accessibility. How would you create such a solution?

Update the code to fix the problems described above.

```html live-sample___html-ally-4
<header>
  <img
    src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/star-pink_32x32.png"
    alt="A star that I use to decorate my page" />
  <h1>Groovy images</h1>
</header>
<main>
  <img
    src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/ballon-portrait.jpg" />
  <img
    src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/grapefruit-slice.jpg" />
</main>
```

```css live-sample___html-ally-4
body {
  width: 400px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

main img {
  display: block;
  width: 250px;
  margin: 20px auto;
  box-shadow: 5px 5px 0 black;
}

header {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 20px;
}
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample("html-ally-4", "100%", 400) }}

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

The accessibility issues are:

1. The header image is decorative, so doesn't need alt text. The best solution if you are going to use decorative HTML images is to put `alt=""`, so a screen reader will just read out nothing — rather than a description, or the image file name. It is not part of the content.
2. The gallery images need alt text, and they are part of the content.

The updated HTML could look something like this:

```html
<header>
  <img
    src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/star-pink_32x32.png"
    alt="" />
  <h1>Groovy images</h1>
</header>
<main>
  <img
    src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/ballon-portrait.jpg"
    alt="a hot air balloon covered in a blue and while checked pattern" />
  <img
    src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/grapefruit-slice.jpg"
    alt="A cross-section of the middle of a pink grapefruit" />
</main>
```

It would be arguably better to implement the background header image using CSS background images. To do so, you would remove the first `<img>` element from the markup, and add a rule to the CSS like this:

```css
h1 {
  background: url("https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/star-pink_32x32.png")
    no-repeat left;
  padding-left: 50px;
}
```

## WAI-ARIA 1

Our first ARIA task includes a section of non-semantic markup, which is visually meant to be a list. Assuming you are not able to change the elements used, how can you allow screen reader users to understand what it is?

To complete the task, add some WAI-ARIA semantics to make screen readers recognize the `<div>` elements as an unordered list.

Your finished HTML should look something like this:

```html
<div role="list">
  <div role="listitem">Pig</div>
  <div role="listitem">Gazelle</div>

  <div role="listitem">Majestic moose</div>
  <div role="listitem">Hedgehog</div>
</div>
```

## WAI-ARIA 2

In our second WAI-ARIA task, we present a basic search form, and we want you to add in a couple of WAI-ARIA features to improve its accessibility.

To complete the task:

1. Add an attribute to allow the search form to be called out as a separate landmark on the page by screen readers, to make it easily findable.
2. Give the search input a suitable label, without explicitly adding a visible text label to the DOM.

```html live-sample___aria-2
<form>
  <input type="search" name="search" />
</form>
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample("aria-2", "100%", 100) }}

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

Your finished HTML should look something like this:

```html
<form role="search">
  <input
    type="search"
    name="search"
    aria-label="Search for your favorite content on our site" />
</form>
```

</details>

## WAI-ARIA 3

For this final WAI-ARIA task, we return to an example we previously saw in the [CSS and JavaScript skill test](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/Test_your_skills/CSS_and_JavaScript).
As before, we have an app that presents a list of animal names. Clicking one of the animal names causes a further description of that animal to appear in a box below the list. Here, we are starting with a mouse- and keyboard-accessible version.

The problem we have now is that when the DOM changes to show a new description, screen readers cannot see what has changed. Can you update it so that description changes are announced by the screen reader?

```html live-sample___aria-3
<section class="preview">
  <div class="animal-list">
    <h1>Animal summaries</h1>

    <p>
      The following list of animals can be clicked to display a description of
      that animal.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li
        tabindex="0"
        data-description="A type of wild mountain goat, with large recurved horns, found in Eurasia, North Africa, and East Africa.">
        Ibex
      </li>
      <li
        tabindex="0"
        data-description="A medium-sized marine mammal, similar to a manatee, but with a Dolphin-like tail.">
        Dugong
      </li>
      <li
        tabindex="0"
        data-description="A rare marsupial, which looks rather like a tiny kangaroo, measuring around 50 to 75 centimeters.">
        Quokka
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="animal-description">
    <h2></h2>

    <p></p>
  </div>
</section>
```

```css hidden live-sample___aria-3
p {
  color: purple;
  margin: 0.5em 0;
}

* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

li {
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

```js hidden live-sample___aria-3
const listItems = document.querySelectorAll("li");
const descHeading = document.querySelector(".animal-description h2");
const descPara = document.querySelector(".animal-description p");

listItems.forEach((item) => {
  item.addEventListener("mouseup", handleSelection);
  item.addEventListener("keyup", (e) => {
    if (e.key === "Enter") {
      handleSelection(e);
    }
  });
});

function handleSelection(e) {
  const heading = e.target.textContent;
  const description = e.target.getAttribute("data-description");
  descHeading.textContent = heading;
  descPara.textContent = description;
}
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample("aria-3", "100%", 400) }}

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

There are two ways to solve the problem outlined in this task:

- Add an `aria-live=""` attribute to the animal-description `<div>` to turn it into a live region, so when its content changes, the updated content will be read out by a screen reader. The best value is probably `assertive`, which makes the screen reader read out the updated content as soon as it changed. `polite` means that the screen reader will wait until other descriptions have finished before it starts reading out the changed content.
- Add a `role="alert"` attribute to the animal-description `<div>`, to make it have alert box semantics. This has the same effect on the screen reader as setting `aria-live="assertive"` on it.

# Accessibility tooling and assistive technology

{{PreviousMenuNext("Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/What_is_Accessibility","Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/HTML", "Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility")}}

Next, we turn our attention to accessibility tooling, providing information on the kinds of tools you can use to help solve accessibility issues, and helping you understand the **assistive technologies** used by people with disabilities to help them browse the web. You'll be using the tools described here throughout subsequent articles.

## Accessibility tools

Let's have a look at the tools and techniques you can use for testing website accessibility and fixing the issues you uncover.

### Testing source order

Your content should make logical sense in its source order — you can always display it differently with CSS later on, but you should get the underlying structure correct to begin with. This is because assistive technologies read website content based on the order of the source, and disabled people often modify or turn off parts of the CSS to make content more legible (common examples are increasing font size and applying high contrast color schemes).

To test source order, you can turn off a site's CSS and see how understandable it is without it. You could do this manually by just removing the CSS from your code, but the easiest way is to use browser features, for example:

- Firefox: Select _View > Page Style > No Style_ from the main menu.
- Safari: [Open the browser developer tools](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools#how_to_open_the_devtools_in_your_browser), click the _Device Settings_ button near the top-left of the developer tools panel (looks like a computer monitor), then check the "Disable CSS" checkbox in the panel that appears.
- Chrome/Edge: Install the [Web Developer Toolbar](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-developer/bfbameneiokkgbdmiekhjnmfkcnldhhm) extension, then restart the browser. Click the "Web Developer" gear icon that should now be available in your extensions menu, then select _CSS > Disable All Styles_.

### Color contrast checkers

When choosing a color scheme for your website, you should make sure that the text (foreground) color contrasts well with the background color. Your design might look cool, but it is no good if people can't read your content. Use a tool like WebAIM's [Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to check whether your scheme is contrasting enough.

Another tip is to avoid using only color for signposts or highlighting important information, as this might be missed by people with visual impairments like color blindness. Instead of marking required form fields in red, for example, mark them with an asterisk and in red.

> [!NOTE]
> A high contrast ratio will also allow anyone using a smartphone or tablet with a glossy screen to better read pages when in a bright environment, such as sunlight.

### Auditing tools

There are several auditing tools available that you can feed your web pages into. They will look over them and return a list of accessibility issues present on the page. Let's look at [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/) as an example, an online accessibility testing tool that accepts a web address and returns an annotated view of that page with accessibility problems highlighted.

1. Go to the [Wave homepage](https://wave.webaim.org/).
2. Enter the URL of our [bad-form.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/html/bad-form.html) example into the text input box near the top of the page. Then press enter or click/tap the arrow at the far right edge of the input box.
3. The site should highlight the accessibility problems present. Click the displayed icons to see more information about each of the issues identified by Wave's evaluation.

Other auditing tools that are worth checking out:

- [Firefox Accessibility Inspector](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/accessibility_inspector/index.html)
- [ANDI bookmarklet](https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/andi/help/install.html)
- [Google Lighthouse accessibility audits](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/accessibility/scoring)

> [!NOTE]
> Such tools aren't good enough to solve all your accessibility problems on their own. You'll need a combination of these, knowledge and experience, user testing, etc. to get a full picture.

[Deque's aXe tool](https://www.deque.com/axe/) goes a bit further than the auditing tools we mentioned above. Like the others, it checks pages and returns accessibility errors. Its most immediately useful form is probably the browser extensions:

- [aXe for Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd)
- [aXe for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/axe-devtools/)

These add an accessibility tab to the browser developer tools. For example, we installed the Firefox version, then used it to audit our [bad-table.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/html/bad-table.html) example. We got the following results:

![A screenshot of accessibility issues identified by the Axe tool.](axe-screenshot.png)

aXe is also installable using `npm`, and can be integrated with task runners like [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/), automation frameworks like [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) and [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/), unit testing frameworks like [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/), and more besides (again, see the [main aXe page](https://www.deque.com/axe/) for details).

## Screen readers

One of the most common types of assistive technology (AT) that disabled people use — and one of the most common ones you'll use to test the accessibility of your webpages — is **screen readers**. These are pieces of software that read out webpage content or content from other apps installed on someone's operating system. Screen readers enable people to use computers without having to see any visual content.

Web browsers expose information about the page's content for screen readers (and other AT) to communicate to the user through a representation called the [accessibility tree](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessibility_tree). This provides semantic information such as names and descriptions of elements, what their purpose or role is (is it a button, or an input field?), and whether they are in a particular state (for example, is a dialog box open or closed?).

This information might be trivial in the case of a paragraph of text, which sounds pretty much how it is written, but it can get complicated when it comes to user interface features such as a drop-down menu or a video player. This is why it's very important to use semantic HTML correctly, which you'll look at in detail in the next article in this module. If you mark up content using the wrong element, it can confuse screen reader users.

Make sure you have a screen reader or two installed on your development machine, and try using your favorite websites via a screen reader, as discussed below. Understanding how visually impaired people use the web is key to designing products that work better for everyone.

### What screen readers are available?

There are several screen readers available:

- Some are paid-for commercial products, like [JAWS](https://www.freedomscientific.com/Products/software/JAWS/) (Windows).
- Some are free products, like [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/) (Windows), [ChromeVox](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/7031755) (Chrome, Windows, and macOS), and [Orca](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Orca) (Linux).
- Some are built into the operating system, like [VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision) (macOS and iOS), [ChromeVox](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/7031755) (on Chromebooks), and [TalkBack](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.marvin.talkback) (Android).

Generally, screen readers are separate apps that run on the host operating system and can read web pages and content in other apps as well (this is not always the case; ChromeVox for example is a browser extension). Screen readers tend to have some differences in exact behavior and controls, so you'll have to consult the documentation for your chosen screen reader to get all the details. Saying that, they all work in basically the same sort of way.

In the next couple of sections, we'll go through some tests with a couple of different screen readers to give you a general idea of how they work and how to test with them.

> [!NOTE]
> WebAIM's [Designing for Screen Reader Compatibility](https://webaim.org/techniques/screenreader/) provides some useful information about screen reader usage and what works best for screen readers. Also see [Screen Reader User Survey #10 Results](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey10/#used) for some interesting screen reader usage statistics.

#### VoiceOver

VoiceOver (VO) comes free with Apple mac/iPhone/iPad, so it's useful for testing on desktop/mobile if you use Apple products. We tested it on macOS on a MacBook Pro.

To turn it on, press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd>. If you've not used VO before, you will be given a welcome screen where you can choose to start VO or not, and run through a rather useful tutorial to learn how to use it. To turn it off, press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd> again.

> [!NOTE]
> You should go through the tutorial at least once — it is a really useful way to learn VO.

When VO is on, the display will look mostly the same, but you'll see a black box at the bottom left of the screen that contains information on what VO currently has selected. The current selection will also be highlighted, with a black border — this highlight is known as the **VO cursor**.

![A sample screenshot demonstrating accessibility testing using VoiceOver on the MDN homepage. The bottom left of the image is a highlight of the information selected on the webpage.](voiceover.png)

To use VO, you will make a lot of use of the "VO modifier" — this is a key or key combination that you need to press in addition to the actual VO keyboard shortcuts to get them to work. Using a modifier like this is common with screen readers, to enable them to keep their commands from clashing with other commands. In the case of VO, the modifier can either be <kbd>CapsLock</kbd>, or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd>.

VO has many keyboard commands, and we won't list them all here. The basic ones you'll need for web page testing are in the following table. In the keyboard shortcuts, "VO" means "the VoiceOver modifier".

<table class="standard-table no-markdown">
  <caption>
    Common VoiceOver keyboard shortcuts
  </caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Keyboard shortcut</th>
      <th scope="col">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>VO + Cursor keys</td>
      <td>Move the VO cursor up, right, down, left.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>VO + Spacebar</td>
      <td>
        Select/activate items highlighted by the VO cursor. This includes items
        selected in the Rotor (see below).
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>VO + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + down cursor</td>
      <td>
        Move into a group of items such as an HTML table or form. Once
        inside a group, you can move around and select items inside that group
        using the above commands as normal.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>VO + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + up cursor</td>
      <td>Move out of a group.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>VO + <kbd>C</kbd></td>
      <td>(when inside a table) Read the header of the current column.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>VO + <kbd>R</kbd></td>
      <td>(when inside a table) Read the header of the current row.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>VO + <kbd>C</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> (two Cs in succession)</td>
      <td>
        (when inside a table) Read the entire current column, including header.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>VO + <kbd>R</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> (two Rs in succession)</td>
      <td>
        (when inside a table) Read the entire current row, including the headers
        that correspond to each cell.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>VO + left cursor, VO + right cursor</td>
      <td>
        (when inside some horizontal options, such as a date picker)
        Move between options.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>VO + up cursor, VO + down cursor</td>
      <td>
        (when inside some horizontal options, such as a date picker)
        Change the current option.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>VO + <kbd>U</kbd></td>
      <td>
        Open the Rotor, which displays lists of headings, links, form controls,
        etc. for easy navigation.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>VO + left cursor, VO + right cursor</td>
      <td>
        (when inside Rotor) Move between different lists available in the Rotor.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>VO + up cursor, VO + down cursor</td>
      <td>
        (when inside Rotor) Move between different items in the current Rotor
        list.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><kbd>Esc</kbd></td>
      <td>(when inside Rotor) Exit Rotor.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></td>
      <td>(when VO is speaking) Pause/Resume speech.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>VO + <kbd>Z</kbd></td>
      <td>Restart the last bit of speech.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>VO + <kbd>D</kbd></td>
      <td>Go into the mac's Dock, so you can select apps to run inside it.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

This seems like a lot of commands, but it isn't so bad when you get used to it, and VO regularly gives you reminders of what commands to use in certain places. Have a play with VO now; you can then go on to play with some of our examples in the [Screen reader testing](#screen_reader_testing) section.

#### NVDA

NVDA is Windows-only, and you'll need to install it.

1. Download NVDA from [nvaccess.org](https://www.nvaccess.org/), then install it. You can choose whether to make a donation or download it for free; you'll also need to give them your email address before you can download it.
2. To start NVDA once installed, double-click on the program file/shortcut, or use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd>. You'll see the NVDA welcome dialog when you start it. Here you can choose from a couple of options, then press the _OK_ button to get going.

NVDA will now be active on your computer.

To use NVDA, you will make a lot of use of the "NVDA modifier" — the key that you need to press in addition to the actual NVDA keyboard shortcuts to get them to work. The NVDA modifier can either be <kbd>Insert</kbd> (the default), or <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> (can be chosen by checking the first checkbox in the NVDA welcome dialog before pressing _OK_).

> [!NOTE]
> NVDA is more subtle than VoiceOver in terms of how it highlights where it is and what it is doing. When you are scrolling through headings, lists, etc., items you are selected on will generally be highlighted with a subtle outline, but this is not always the case for all things. If you get completely lost, you can press Ctrl + F5 to refresh the current page and begin from the top again.

NVDA has many keyboard commands, and we won't list them all here. The basic ones you'll need for web page testing are in the following table. In the keyboard shortcuts, "NVDA" means "the NVDA modifier".

<table class="standard-table no-markdown">

### Screen reader testing

Now you've gotten used to using a screen reader, we'd like you to use it to do some quick accessibility tests, to get an idea of how screen readers deal with good and bad webpage features:

- Look at [good-semantics.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/html/good-semantics.html), and note how the headers are found by the screen reader and available to use for navigation. Now look at [bad-semantics.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/html/bad-semantics.html), and note how the screen reader gets none of this information. Imagine how annoying this would be when trying to navigate a really long page of text.
- Look at [good-links.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/html/good-links.html), and note how they make sense when viewed out of context, for example in the VoiceOver Rotor. This is not the case with [bad-links.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/html/bad-links.html) — they are all just "click here".
- Look at [good-form.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/html/good-form.html), and note how the form inputs are described using their labels because we've added appropriate {{htmlelement("label")}} elements. In [bad-form.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/html/bad-form.html), they get an unhelpful label along the lines of "blank".
- Look at our [punk-bands-complete.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/css/styling-boxes/styling-tables/punk-bands-complete.html) example, and see how the screen reader is able to associate columns and rows of content and read them out all together because we've defined the table headers properly. In [bad-table.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/html/bad-table.html), none of the cells can be associated at all. Note that NVDA seems to behave slightly strangely when you've only got a single table on a page; you could try [WebAIM's table test page](https://webaim.org/articles/nvda/tables.htm) instead.
- Have a look at [WAI-ARIA live regions example](https://www.freedomscientific.com/SurfsUp/AriaLiveRegions.htm), and note how the screen reader will keep reading out the constantly updating section as it updates.

## Other tooling

Screen readers are one of the most common types of assistive technology that you'll encounter as a web developer, but other AT types exist, and it is useful to be familiar with what users are potentially using to access your content. This section summarizes some of them.

### Large text or braille keyboards

It is possible to get large text keyboards designed for use by visually impaired or older users, and braille keyboards designed to be usable by blind and severely visually impaired people.

### Alternative pointing devices

When you think of pointing devices, mice are the obvious example, but there are other pointing devices designed to allow users with differing mobility impairments to navigate user interfaces more easily:

- Trackballs: Kind of like upside-down mice, trackballs consist of a mounted ball that stays stationary on your desk, which you can roll to move the pointer around. They are considered more precise and easier to handle than mice, especially for people with limited hand movement.
- Joysticks: A control stick that can be moved to move the pointer around. Joysticks are less precise than trackballs but usable by people with a wide range of physical impairments, even severe disabilities.
- Touchpads: Most modern laptops have a touchpad (sometimes called a trackpad) — a flat tactile sensor allowing you to move the pointer around with a finger, as well as performing multi-finger gestures in the same way as mobile gestures. You can buy external touchpads for devices that don't have internal ones. Some people find them to be more precise than mice.

### Screen magnifiers

Screen magnifiers provide partially-sighted users with a magnified view of their device's display to enable them to understand and interact with device content more easily, as well as providing other features such as color adjustment to help with color blindness, and adjusting the size of mouse pointers and text cursors to make them easier to see.

Software and hardware screen magnifiers are available:

- Most modern operating systems have a built-in app for magnifying all or part of the screen, for example Zoom on mac or Magnifier on Windows. They also tend to provide options for universally increasing the text size, mouse cursor size, etc. Third-party options are available as well.
- Hardware screen magnifiers tend to consist of a separate screen that sits next to or in front of your device's screen and projects a larger version of it, or a zoomed version of part of it.

### Voice recognition software

Voice (or speech) recognition software allows you to speak commands to control your device and/or speak the text of emails or documents and have the computer write the text for you. This is very useful for people who are unable to use a keyboard or other control mechanisms.

Modern operating systems have features built in to enable this (for example Dictation on mac, or Voice Access on Windows), and there are third-party apps available too, from desktop apps to browser extensions.

### Switch controls

Switch controls provide a mechanism for interacting with devices for users with very limited mobility or [cognitive impairment](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Guides/Cognitive_accessibility).

A switch control setup usually involves two parts:

- A physical switch or button for activating options on the device. You can also assign switch functionality to regular device buttons (such as volume controls) or keys on a keyboard.
- A device mode or third-party software add-on that makes the device compatible with the switch or button control. For example, Switch Access on Android is a mode whereby the different options in various situations (for example, apps on the home screen) are cycled through and then the one you want can be selected with a button or switch when reached.

## Planing for accessibility

You should think carefully about accessibility near the start of each project. Make sure accessibility is considered during the initial design phase, so that you can:

- Get the basics right, for example using [good document structure](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/HTML#use_well-structured_text_content) and providing [alternative text](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/HTML#text_alternatives) for images.
- Carefully consider the best approach for features that are likely to have accessibility issues. For example, audio and video will definitely be inaccessible to some people, so you should provide alternatives such as [transcripts](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/Multimedia#audio_transcripts) and [text tracks](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/Multimedia#video_text_tracks).
- Avoid costly mistakes later on. Issues uncovered near the end of a project tend to be far more time consuming and expensive to fix than issues caught early on.

## User testing

You can't rely on automated tools alone for determining accessibility problems on your site. Every website project needs a [user testing strategy](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Testing/Testing_strategies#user_testing), and it is highly recommended that you include some accessibility user groups:

- Try to get some screen reader users involved, some keyboard-only users, some non-hearing users, users with mobility impairments, etc.
- Get each group to try using the website generally, starting with looking at the home page and other major pages, and trying out some of the primary functionality. Typical examples include buying a product or making a booking. Ask them what their impressions were, and what problems they ran into.
- Next, get them to focus on features or workflows that you have specific accessibility concerns with, such as complex form controls or video players. Ask them what is lacking for them in terms of user experience, and what they'd like to see changed.

Some projects will have a budget to pay testing groups, whereas others will rely on unpaid volunteers or even colleagues and friends.

## Accessibility testing checklist

The following list provides a checklist for you to follow to make sure you've carried out the recommended accessibility testing for your project:

1. Make sure your HTML is as semantically correct as possible. [Validating it](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Debugging_HTML#html_validation) is a good start, as is using an [auditing tool](#auditing_tools).
2. Check that your content makes sense when the CSS is turned off.
3. Make sure your functionality is keyboard accessible (see [Use semantic UI controls where possible](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/HTML#use_semantic_ui_controls_where_possible) for more details). Test using Tab, Return/Enter, etc.
4. Make sure your non-text content has [text alternatives](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/HTML#text_alternatives). An [auditing tool](#auditing_tools) is good for catching such problems.
5. Make sure your site's [color contrast](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/CSS_and_JavaScript#color_and_color_contrast) is acceptable, using a suitable checking tool.
6. Make sure [hidden content](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/CSS_and_JavaScript#hiding_things) is visible by screen readers.
7. Make sure that functionality is usable without JavaScript wherever possible.
8. Use ARIA to improve accessibility where appropriate.
9. Run your site through an [auditing tool](#auditing_tools).
10. Test it with a screen reader.
11. Include an accessibility policy/statement somewhere findable on your site to say what you did.

## Summary

Hopefully this article has given you an idea of the kinds of tools you can use to help fix accessibility issues, the assistive technology used by people with disabilities to help access the web.

Following on from the previous article, sometimes making complex UI controls that involve unsemantic HTML and dynamic JavaScript-updated content can be difficult. WAI-ARIA is a technology that can help with such problems by adding in further semantics that browsers and assistive technologies can recognize and use to let users know what is going on. Here we'll show how to use it at a basic level to improve accessibility.

## What is WAI-ARIA?

Let's start by looking at what WAI-ARIA is, and what it can do for us.

### A whole new set of problems

As web apps started to get more complex and dynamic, a new set of accessibility features and problems started to appear.

For example, HTML introduced a number of semantic elements to define common page features ({{htmlelement("nav")}}, {{htmlelement("footer")}}, etc.). Before these were available, developers would use {{htmlelement("div")}}s with IDs or classes, e.g., `<div class="nav">`, but these were problematic, as there was no easy way to easily find a specific page feature such as the main navigation programmatically.

The initial solution was to add one or more hidden links at the top of the page to link to the navigation (or whatever else), for example:

```html
<a href="#hidden" class="hidden">Skip to navigation</a>
```

But this is still not very precise, and can only be used when the screen reader is reading from the top of the page.

As another example, apps started to feature complex controls like date pickers for choosing dates, sliders for choosing values, etc. HTML provides special input types to render such controls:

```html
<input type="date" /> <input type="range" />
```

These were originally not well-supported and it was, and still is to a lesser extent, difficult to style them, leading designers and developers to opt for custom solutions. Instead of using these native features, some developers rely on JavaScript libraries that generate such controls as a series of nested {{htmlelement("div")}}s which are then styled using CSS and controlled using JavaScript.

The problem here is that visually they work, but screen readers can't make any sense of what they are at all, and their users just get told that they can see a jumble of elements with no semantics to describe what they mean.

### Enter WAI-ARIA

[WAI-ARIA](https://w3c.github.io/aria/) (Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is a specification written by the W3C, defining a set of additional HTML attributes that can be applied to elements to provide additional semantics and improve accessibility wherever it is lacking. There are three main features defined in the spec:

- [Roles](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles)
  - : These define what an element is or does. Many of these are so-called landmark roles, which largely duplicate the semantic value of structural elements, such as `role="navigation"` ({{htmlelement("nav")}}), `role="banner"` (document {{htmlelement("header")}}), `role="complementary"` ({{htmlelement("aside")}}) or , `role="search"` ({{htmlelement("search")}}). Some other roles describe different page structures that do not have elements with that match those roles, such as `role="tablist"`, and `role="tabpanel"`, which are commonly found in UIs.
- Properties
  - : These define properties of elements, which can be used to give them extra meaning or semantics. As an example, `aria-required="true"` specifies that a form input needs to be filled in order to be valid, whereas `aria-labelledby="label"` allows you to put an ID on an element, then reference it as being the label for anything else on the page, including multiple elements, which is not possible using `<label for="input">`. As an example, you could use `aria-labelledby` to specify that a key description contained in a {{htmlelement("div")}} is the label for multiple table cells, or you could use it as an alternative to image alt text — specify existing information on the page as an image's alt text, rather than having to repeat it inside the `alt` attribute. You can see an example of this at [Text alternatives](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/HTML#text_alternatives).
- States
  - : Special properties that define the current conditions of elements, such as `aria-disabled="true"`, which specifies to a screen reader that a form input is currently disabled. States differ from properties in that properties don't change throughout the lifecycle of an app, whereas states can change, generally programmatically via JavaScript.

An important point about WAI-ARIA attributes is that they don't affect anything about the web page, except for the information exposed by the browser's accessibility APIs (where screen readers get their information from). WAI-ARIA doesn't affect webpage structure, the DOM, etc., although the attributes can be useful for selecting elements by CSS.

> [!NOTE]
> You can find a useful list of all the ARIA roles and their uses, with links to further information, in the WAI-ARIA spec — see [Definition of Roles](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#role_definitions) — on this site — see [ARIA roles](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles).
>
> The spec also contains a list of all the properties and states, with links to further information — see [Definitions of States and Properties (all `aria-*` attributes)](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#state_prop_def).

## Where is WAI-ARIA supported?

This is not an easy question to answer. It is difficult to find a conclusive resource that states what features of WAI-ARIA are supported, and where, because:

1. There are a lot of features in the WAI-ARIA spec.
2. There are many combinations of operating systems, browsers, and screen readers to consider.

This last point is key — To use a screen reader in the first place, your operating system needs to run browsers that have the necessary accessibility APIs in place to expose the information screen readers need to do their job. Most popular OSes have one or two browsers in place that screen readers can work with. The Paciello Group has a fairly up-to-date post that provides data for this — see [Rough Guide: browsers, operating systems and screen reader support updated](https://www.tpgi.com/rough-guide-browsers-operating-systems-and-screen-reader-support-updated/).

Next, you need to worry about whether the browsers in question support ARIA features and expose them via their APIs, but also whether screen readers recognize that information and present it to their users in a useful way.

1. Browser support is almost universal.
2. Screen reader support for ARIA features isn't quite at this level, but the most popular screen readers are getting there. You can get an idea of support levels by looking at Powermapper's [WAI-ARIA Screen reader compatibility](https://www.powermapper.com/tests/screen-readers/aria/) article.

In this article, we won't attempt to cover every WAI-ARIA feature, and its exact support details. Instead, we will cover the most critical WAI-ARIA features for you to know about; if we don't mention any support details, you can assume that the feature is well-supported. We will clearly mention any exceptions to this.

> [!NOTE]
> Some JavaScript libraries support WAI-ARIA, meaning that when they generate UI features like complex form controls, they add ARIA attributes to improve the accessibility of those features. If you are looking for a 3rd party JavaScript solution for rapid UI development, you should definitely consider the accessibility of its UI widgets as an important factor when making your choice. Good examples are jQuery UI (see [About jQuery UI: Deep accessibility support](https://jqueryui.com/about/#deep-accessibility-support)), [ExtJS](https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/), and [Dojo/Dijit](https://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/1.10/dijit/a11y/statement.html).

## When should you use WAI-ARIA?

We talked about some of the problems that prompted WAI-ARIA to be created earlier on, but essentially, there are four main areas that WAI-ARIA is useful in:

- Signposts/Landmarks
  - : ARIA's [`role`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles) attribute values can act as landmarks that either replicate the semantics of HTML elements (e.g., {{htmlelement("nav")}}), or go beyond HTML semantics to provide signposts to different functional areas, for example, `search`, `tablist`, `tab`, `listbox`, etc.
- Dynamic content updates
  - : Screen readers tend to have difficulty with reporting constantly changing content; with ARIA we can use `aria-live` to inform screen reader users when an area of content is updated dynamically: for example, by JavaScript in the page [fetching new content from the server and updating the DOM](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Network_requests).
- Enhancing keyboard accessibility
  - : There are built-in HTML elements that have native keyboard accessibility; when other elements are used along with JavaScript to simulate similar interactions, keyboard accessibility and screen reader reporting suffers as a result. Where this is unavoidable, WAI-ARIA provides a means to allow other elements to receive focus (using `tabindex`).
- Accessibility of non-semantic controls
  - : When a series of nested `<div>`s along with CSS/JavaScript is used to create a complex UI-feature, or a native control is greatly enhanced/changed via JavaScript, accessibility can suffer — screen reader users will find it difficult to work out what the feature does if there are no semantics or other clues. In these situations, ARIA can help to provide what's missing with a combination of roles like `button`, `listbox`, or `tablist`, and properties like `aria-required` or `aria-posinset` to provide further clues as to functionality.

In the next section, we'll look at the four main areas described earlier in more detail, along with examples. Before you continue, you should put a screen reader testing setup in place, so you can test some of the examples as you go through. See our section on [testing screen readers](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/Tooling#screen_readers) for more information.

> [!CALLOUT]

> **You should only use WAI-ARIA when you need to!**

> Using the correct HTML elements implicitly gives you the roles that are needed and you should _always_ use [native HTML features](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/HTML) to provide the semantics required by screen readers to tell their users what is going on. Sometimes this isn't possible, either because you have limited control over the code, or because you are creating something complex that doesn't have an easy HTML element to implement it. In such cases, WAI-ARIA can be a valuable accessibility enhancing tool.

## Signposts/Landmarks

WAI-ARIA adds the [`role` attribute](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#role_definitions) to browsers, which allows you to add extra semantic value to elements on your site wherever they are needed. The first major area in which this is useful is providing information for screen readers so that their users can find common page elements. This example has the following structure:

```html live-sample___aria-website-no-roles
<header>
  <h1>Header</h1>

  <!-- Even is it's not mandatory, it's common practice to put the main navigation menu within the main header -->

  <nav>

      <li><a href="#">Team</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Projects</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>

    <!-- A Search form is another common non-linear way to navigate through a website. -->

    <form>
      <input type="search" name="q" placeholder="Search query" />
      <input type="submit" value="Go!" />

If you try testing the example with a screen reader in a modern browser, you'll already get some useful information. For example, VoiceOver gives you the following:

- On the `<header>` element — "banner, 2 items" (it contains a heading and the `<nav>`).
- On the `<nav>` element — "navigation 2 items" (it contains a list and a form).
- On the `<main>` element — "main 2 items" (it contains an article and an aside).
- On the `<aside>` element — "complementary 2 items" (it contains a heading and a list).
- On the search form input — "Search query, insertion at beginning of text".
- On the `<footer>` element — "footer 1 item".

If you go to VoiceOver's landmarks menu (accessed using VoiceOver key + U and then using the cursor keys to cycle through the menu choices), you'll see that most of the elements are nicely listed so they can be accessed quickly.

![Mac's VoiceOver menu for quick accessibility. Landmarks header and landmarks list including banner, navigation, main, and complementary.](landmarks-list.png)

However, we could do better here. The search form is a really important landmark that people will want to find, but it is not listed in the landmarks menu or treated like a notable landmark beyond the actual input being called out as a search input (`<input type="search">`).

To mark the form as a landmark, you can either wrap it with the {{htmlelement("search")}} element or give it ARIA `role="search"`. As a general rule, use HTML semantics where possible and only use ARIA where there is no HTML equivalent.

```html live-sample___aria-website-roles

Most importantly, we have used semantic HTML that gives meaning and roles to the structure of the page without adding unnecessary [`role`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles) attributes to our HTML structure, which has a structure like this:

```html
<header>
  <h1>…</h1>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      …
    </ul>
    <search>
      <form>
        <!-- search form -->
      </form>
    </search>
  </nav>
</header>

<main>
  <article>…</article>
  <aside>…</aside>
</main>

<footer>…</footer>
```

We've also given you a bonus feature in this example — the {{htmlelement("input")}} element has been given the attribute [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label), which gives it a descriptive label to be read out by a screen reader, even though we haven't included a {{htmlelement("label")}} element. In cases like these, this is very useful — a search form like this one is a very common, easily recognized feature, and adding a visual label would spoil the page design.

```html
<input
  type="search"
  name="q"
  placeholder="Search query"
  aria-label="Search through site content" />
```

Now if we use VoiceOver to look at this example, we get some improvements:

- The search form is called out as a separate item, both when browsing through the page, and in the Landmarks menu.
- The label text contained in the `aria-label` attribute is read out when the form input is highlighted.

If you need to support older browsers such as IE8; it is worth including ARIA roles for that purpose. And if for some reason your site is built using just `<div>`s, you should definitely include the ARIA roles to provide these much needed semantics!

You'll see a lot more about these semantics and the power of ARIA properties/attributes below, especially in the [Accessibility of non-semantic controls](#accessibility_of_non-semantic_controls) section. For now though, let's look at how ARIA can help with dynamic content updates.

## Dynamic content updates

Content loaded into the DOM can be easily accessed using a screen reader, from textual content to alternative text attached to images. Traditional static websites with largely text content are therefore easy to make accessible for people with visual impairments.

The problem is that modern web apps are often not just static text — they often update parts of the page by fetching new content from the server (in this example we are using a static array of quotes) and updating the DOM. These are sometimes referred to as **live regions**.

Let's look at an example — a random quote generator:

```html live-sample___aria-no-live
<section>
  <h1>Random quote generator</h1>
  <button>Start giving me quotes</button>
  <blockquote>
    <p></p>
  </blockquote>
</section>
```

```css hidden live-sample___aria-no-live live-sample___aria-live
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

html {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

html,
body {
  height: 100%;
}

h1 {
  letter-spacing: 2px;
}

p {
  line-height: 1.6;
}

section {
  height: 100%;
  padding: 10px;
  background: #666666;
  text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px black;
  color: white;
}
```

```js live-sample___aria-no-live live-sample___aria-live
let quotes = [
  {
    quote:
      "Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up.",
    author: "Pablo Picasso",
  },
  {
    quote:
      "You can never cross the ocean until you have the courage to lose sight of the shore.",
    author: "Christopher Columbus",
  },
  {
    quote:
      "I love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by.",
    author: "Douglas Adams",
  },
];
```

```js live-sample___aria-no-live live-sample___aria-live
const quotePara = document.querySelector("section p");
const btn = document.querySelector("button");

btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  function showQuote() {
    let random = Math.floor(Math.random() * quotes.length);
    quotePara.textContent = `${quotes[random].quote} -- ${quotes[random].author}`;
  }

  showQuote();
  btn.disabled = true;
  window.setInterval(showQuote, 5000);
});
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("aria-no-live", "100", "220")}}

This works OK, but it is not good for accessibility — the content update is not detected by screen readers, so their users would not know what is going on. This is a fairly trivial example, but just imagine if you were creating a complex UI with lots of constantly updating content, like a chat room, or a strategy game UI, or a live updating shopping cart display — it would be impossible to use the app in any effective way without some kind of way of alerting the user to the updates.

WAI-ARIA, fortunately, provides a useful mechanism to provide these alerts — the [`aria-live`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-live) property. Applying this to an element causes screen readers to read out the content that is updated. How urgently the content is read out depends on the attribute value:

- `off`
  - : The default. Updates should not be announced.
- `polite`
  - : Updates should be announced only if the user is idle.
- `assertive`
  - : Updates should be announced to the user as soon as possible.

Here we update the `<blockquote>` opening tag as follows:

```html
<blockquote aria-live="assertive">…</blockquote>
```

This will cause a screen reader to read out the content as it is updated: try testing the updated the updated live version:

```html hidden live-sample___aria-live
<section>
  <h1>Random quote generator</h1>
  <button>Start giving me quotes</button>
  <blockquote aria-live="assertive">
    <p></p>
  </blockquote>
</section>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("aria-live", "100", "220")}}

> [!NOTE]
> There are some other ARIA properties related to `aria-live` that are also worth knowing about:
>
> - The [`aria-atomic`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-atomic) property, when set to `true`, tells screen readers to read out the entire element contents as one atomic unit, not just the bits that were updated. This is useful when only a section's contents are being updated, but you also want the heading to be read out each time something changes, to remind the user of its content.
> - The [`aria-relevant`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-relevant) property is useful for controlling what gets read out when a live region is updated. You can for example only get content additions or removals read out.

## Enhancing keyboard accessibility

As discussed in a few other places in the module, one of the key strengths of HTML with respect to accessibility is the built-in keyboard accessibility of features such as buttons, form controls, and links. Generally, you can use the tab key to move between controls, the Enter/Return key to select or activate controls, and occasionally other controls as needed (for example the up and down cursor to move between options in a `<select>` box).

However, sometimes you will end up having to write code that either uses non-semantic elements as buttons (or other types of control), or uses focusable controls for not quite the right purpose. You might be trying to fix some bad code you've inherited, or you might be building some kind of complex widget that requires it.

In terms of making non-focusable code focusable, WAI-ARIA extends the `tabindex` attribute with some new values:

- `tabindex="0"` — as indicated above, this value allows elements that are not normally tabbable to become tabbable. This is the most useful value of `tabindex`.
- `tabindex="-1"` — this allows not normally tabbable elements to receive focus programmatically, e.g., via JavaScript, or as the target of links.

We discussed this in more detail and showed a typical implementation back in our HTML accessibility article — see [Building keyboard accessibility back in](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/HTML#building_keyboard_accessibility_back_in).

## Accessibility of non-semantic controls

This follows on from the previous section — when a series of nested `<div>`s along with CSS/JavaScript is used to create a complex UI-feature, or a native control is greatly enhanced/changed via JavaScript, not only can keyboard accessibility suffer, but screen reader users will find it difficult to work out what the feature does if there are no semantics or other clues. In such situations, ARIA can help to provide those missing semantics.

### Form validation and error alerts

First of all, let's revisit the form example we first looked at in our CSS and JavaScript accessibility article (read [Keeping it unobtrusive](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/CSS_and_JavaScript#keeping_it_unobtrusive) for a full recap). At the end of this section, we showed that we have included some ARIA attributes on the error message box that displays any validation errors when you try to submit the form:

```html
<div class="errors" role="alert" aria-relevant="all">
  <ul></ul>
</div>
```

- [`role="alert"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/alert_role) automatically turns the element it is applied to into a live region, so changes to it are read out; it also semantically identifies it as an alert message (important time/context-sensitive information), and represents a better, more accessible way of delivering an alert to a user (modal dialogs like [`alert()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert) calls have a number of accessibility problems; see [Popup Windows](https://webaim.org/techniques/javascript/other#popups) by WebAIM).
- An [`aria-relevant`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-relevant) value of `all` instructs the screen reader to read out the contents of the error list when any changes are made to it — i.e., when errors are added or removed. This is useful because the user will want to know what errors are left, not just what has been added or removed from the list.

We could go further with our ARIA usage, and provide some more validation help. How about indicating whether fields are required in the first place, and what range the age should be?

1. At this point, take a copy of our [`form-validation.html`](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/accessibility/css/form-validation.html) and [`validation.js`](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/accessibility/css/validation.js) files, and save them in a local directory.
2. Open them both in a text editor and have a look at how the code works.
3. First of all, add a paragraph just above the opening `<form>` tag, like the one below, and mark both the form `<label>`s with an asterisk. This is normally how we mark required fields for sighted users.

   ```html
   <p>Fields marked with an asterisk (*) are required.</p>
   ```

4. This makes visual sense, but it isn't as easy to understand for screen reader users. Fortunately, WAI-ARIA provides the [`aria-required`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-required) attribute to give screen readers hints that they should tell users that form inputs need to be filled in. Update the `<input>` elements like so:

   ```html
   <input type="text" name="name" id="name" aria-required="true" />

   <input type="number" name="age" id="age" aria-required="true" />
   ```

5. If you save the example now and test it with a screen reader, you should hear something like "Enter your name star, required, edit text".
6. It might also be useful if we give screen reader users and sighted users an idea of what the age value should be. This is often presented as a tooltip or placeholder inside the form field. WAI-ARIA does include [`aria-valuemin`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-valuemin) and [`aria-valuemax`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-valuemax) properties to specify min and max values, and screen readers support the native `min` and `max` attributes. Another well-supported feature is the HTML `placeholder` attribute, which can contain a message that is shown in the input when no value is entered and is read out by a few screen readers. Update your number input like this:

   ```html
   <label for="age">Your age:</label>
   <input
     type="number"
     name="age"
     id="age"
     placeholder="Enter 1 to 150"
     required
     aria-required="true" />
   ```

Always include a {{HTMLelement('label')}} for every input. While some screen readers announce the placeholder text, most do not. Acceptable substitutions for providing form controls with an accessible name include [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) and [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby). But the `<label>` element with a `for` attribute is the preferred method as it provides usability for all users, including mouse users.

> [!NOTE]
> You can see the finished example live at [`form-validation-updated.html`](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/aria/form-validation-updated.html).

WAI-ARIA also enables some advanced form labelling techniques, beyond the classic {{htmlelement("label")}} element. We already talked about using the [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) property to provide a label where we don't want the label to be visible to sighted users (see the [Signposts/Landmarks](#signpostslandmarks) section, above). Some other labeling techniques use other properties such as [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) if you want to designate a non-`<label>` element as a label or label multiple form inputs with the same label, and [`aria-describedby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-describedby), if you want to associate other information with a form input and have it read out as well. See [WebAIM's Advanced Form Labeling article](https://webaim.org/techniques/forms/advanced) for more details.

There are many other useful properties and states too, for indicating the status of form elements. For example, `aria-disabled="true"` can be used to indicate that a form field is disabled. Many browsers will skip past disabled form fields which leads to them not being read out by screen readers. In some cases, a disabled element will be perceived, so it is a good idea to include this attribute to let the screen reader know that a disabled form control is in fact disabled.

If the disabled state of an input is likely to change, then it is also a good idea to indicate when it happens, and what the result is. For example, in our [`form-validation-checkbox-disabled.html`](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/aria/form-validation-checkbox-disabled.html) demo, there is a checkbox that when checked, enables another form input to allow further information to be entered. We've set up a hidden live region:

```html
<p class="hidden-alert" aria-live="assertive"></p>
```

which is hidden from view using absolute positioning. When this is checked/unchecked, we update the text inside the hidden live region to tell screen reader users what the result of checking this checkbox is, as well as updating the `aria-disabled` state, and some visual indicators too:

```js
function toggleMusician(bool) {
  const instrument = formItems[formItems.length - 1];
  if (bool) {
    instrument.input.disabled = false;
    instrument.label.style.color = "black";
    instrument.input.setAttribute("aria-disabled", "false");
    hiddenAlert.textContent =
      "Instruments played field now enabled; use it to tell us what you play.";
  } else {
    instrument.input.disabled = true;
    instrument.label.style.color = "#999999";
    instrument.input.setAttribute("aria-disabled", "true");
    instrument.input.removeAttribute("aria-label");
    hiddenAlert.textContent = "Instruments played field now disabled.";
  }
}
```

### Describing non-semantic buttons as buttons

A few times in this course already, we've mentioned the native accessibility of (and the accessibility issues behind using other elements to fake) buttons, links, or form elements (see [Use semantic UI controls where possible](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/HTML#use_semantic_ui_controls_where_possible) in the HTML accessibility article, and [Enhancing keyboard accessibility](#enhancing_keyboard_accessibility), above). Basically, you can add keyboard accessibility back in without too much trouble in many cases, using `tabindex` and a bit of JavaScript.

But what about screen readers? They still won't see the elements as buttons. If we test our [`fake-div-buttons.html`](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/tools-testing/cross-browser-testing/accessibility/fake-div-buttons.html) example in a screen reader, our fake buttons will be reported using phrases like "Click me!, group", which is obviously confusing.

We can fix this using a WAI-ARIA role. Make a local copy of [`fake-div-buttons.html`](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/tools-testing/cross-browser-testing/accessibility/fake-div-buttons.html), and add [`role="button"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/button_role) to each button `<div>`, for example:

```html
<div data-message="This is from the first button" tabindex="0" role="button">
  Click me!
</div>
```

Now when you try this using a screen reader, you'll have buttons be reported using phrases like "Click me!, button". While this is much better, you still have to add in all the native button features users expect, like handling <kbd>enter</kbd> and click events, as explained in the [`button` role documentation](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/button_role).

> [!NOTE]
> Don't forget however that using the correct semantic element where possible is always better. If you want to create a button, and can use a {{htmlelement("button")}} element, you should use a {{htmlelement("button")}} element!

### Guiding users through complex widgets

There are a whole host of other [roles](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles) that can identify non-semantic element structures as common UI features that go beyond what's available in standard HTML, for example [`combobox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/combobox_role), [`slider`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/slider_role), [`tabpanel`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tabpanel_role), [`tree`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tree_role). You can see several useful examples in the [Deque university code library](https://dequeuniversity.com/library/) to give you an idea of how such controls can be made accessible.

You can also find several live examples in our [WAI-ARIA roles](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles) documentation. See for example, our [ARIA: tab role example](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tab_role#example), which explains how to implement an accessible tabbed interface.

## Summary

This article has by no means covered all that's available in WAI-ARIA, but it should have given you enough information to understand how to use it, and know some of the most common patterns you will encounter that require it.

In the next article, we'll give you some tests that you can use to check how well you've understood and retained all this information.

## So what is accessibility?

Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible. We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.

You might also think of accessibility as treating everyone the same, and giving them equal opportunities, no matter what their ability or circumstances. Just as it is wrong to exclude someone from a physical building because they are in a wheelchair (modern public buildings generally have wheelchair ramps or elevators), it is also not right to exclude someone from a website because they have a visual impairment. We are all different, but we are all human, and therefore have the same human rights.

Accessibility is the right thing to do. Providing accessible sites is part of the law in some countries, which can open up some significant markets that otherwise would not be able to use your services or buy your products.

Building accessible sites benefits everyone:

- Semantic HTML, which improves accessibility, also improves SEO, making your site more findable.
- Caring about accessibility demonstrates good ethics and morals, which improves your public image.
- Other good practices that improve accessibility also make your site more usable by other groups, such as mobile phone users or those on low network speed. In fact, everyone can benefit from many such improvements.
- Did we mention it is also the law in some places?

## What kinds of disability are we looking at?

People with disabilities are just as diverse as people without disabilities, and so are their disabilities. The key lesson here is to think beyond your own computer and how you use the web, and start learning about how others use it — _you are not your users_. The main types of disability to consider are explained below, along with any special tools they use to access web content (known as **assistive technologies**, or **ATs**).

> [!NOTE]
> The World Health Organization's [Disability and health](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health) fact sheet states that "Over a billion people, about 15% of the world's population, have some form of disability", and "Between 110 million and 190 million adults have significant difficulties in functioning."

### People with visual impairments

People with visual impairments include people with blindness, low-level vision, and color blindness. Many people with visual impairments use screen magnifiers that are either physical magnifiers or software zoom capabilities. Most browsers and operating systems these days have zoom capabilities. Some users will rely on screen readers, which is software that reads digital text aloud. Some screen reader examples include:

- Paid commercial products, like [JAWS](https://www.freedomscientific.com/Products/software/JAWS/) (Windows) and [Dolphin Screen Reader](https://yourdolphin.com/ScreenReader) (Windows).
- Free products, like [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/) (Windows), [ChromeVox](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/7031755) (Chrome), and [Orca](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Orca) (Linux).
- Software built into the operating system, like [VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision) (macOS, iPadOS, iOS), [Narrator](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/complete-guide-to-narrator-e4397a0d-ef4f-b386-d8ae-c172f109bdb1) (Windows), [ChromeVox](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/7031755) (on ChromeOS), and [TalkBack](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.marvin.talkback) (Android).

It is a good idea to familiarize yourself with screen readers; you should also set up a screen reader and play around with it, to get an idea of how it works. See our [screen reader tutorials](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/Tooling#screen_readers) for more details on using them. The below video also provides a brief example of what the experience is like.

In terms of statistics, the World Health Organization estimates that "285 million people are estimated to be visually impaired worldwide: 39 million are blind and 246 million have low vision." (see [Visual impairment and blindness](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/blindness-and-visual-impairment)). That's a large and significant population of users to just miss out on because your site isn't coded properly — almost the same size as the population of the United States of America.

### People with hearing impairments

[Deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH)](https://www.nad.org/resources/american-sign-language/community-and-culture-frequently-asked-questions/) people have various levels of hearing loss ranging from mild to profound. Although some do use AT (see [Assistive Devices for People with Hearing, Voice, Speech, or Language Disorders](https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/assistive-devices-people-hearing-voice-speech-or-language-disorders)), they are not widespread.

To provide access, textual alternatives must be provided. Videos should be manually captioned, and transcripts should be provided for audio content. Furthermore, due to high levels of [language deprivation](https://epicspecialeducationstaffing.com/language-deprivation/#:~:text=Language%20deprivation%20is%20the%20term,therefore%20not%20exposed%20to%20language.) in DHH populations, [text simplification should be considered](https://circlcenter.org/collaborative-research-automatic-text-simplification-and-reading-assistance-to-support-self-directed-learning-by-deaf-and-hard-of-hearing-computing-workers/).

Deaf and hard-of-hearing people also represent a significant userbase — "466 million people worldwide have disabling hearing loss", says the World Health Organization's [Deafness and hearing loss](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/deafness-and-hearing-loss) fact sheet.

### People with mobility impairments

These people have disabilities concerning movement, which might involve purely physical issues (such as loss of limb or paralysis), or neurological/genetic disorders that lead to weakness or loss of control in limbs. Some people might have difficulty making the exact hand movements required to use a mouse, while others might be more severely affected, perhaps being significantly paralyzed to the point where they need to use a [head pointer](https://www.performancehealth.com/adjustable-headpointer) to interact with computers.

This kind of disability can also be a result of old age, rather than any specific trauma or condition, and it could also result from hardware limitations — some users might not have a mouse.

The way this usually affects web development work is the requirement that controls be accessible by the keyboard — we'll discuss keyboard accessibility in later articles in the module, but it is a good idea to try out some websites using just the keyboard to see how you get on. Can you use the Tab key to move between the different controls of a web form, for example? You can find more details about keyboard controls in our [Use semantic UI controls where possible](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/HTML#use_semantic_ui_controls_where_possible) section.

In terms of statistics, a significant number of people have mobility impairments. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Disability and Functioning (Non-institutionalized Adults 18 Years and Over)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/disability.htm) reports the USA "Percent of adults with any physical functioning difficulty: 16.1%".

### People with cognitive impairments

Cognitive impairment refers to a broad range of disabilities, from people with intellectual disabilities who have the most-limited capabilities, to all of us as we age and have difficulty thinking and remembering. The range includes people with mental illnesses, such as [depression](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression) and [schizophrenia](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia). It also includes people with learning disabilities, such as [dyslexia](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/learningdisabilities) and [attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd). Importantly, though there is a lot of diversity within clinical definitions of cognitive impairments, people with them experience a common set of functional problems. These include difficulty with understanding content, remembering how to complete tasks, and confusion caused by inconsistent webpage layouts.

A good foundation of accessibility for people with cognitive impairments includes:

- Delivering content in more than one way, such as by text-to-speech or by video.
- Easily understood content, such as text written using plain-language standards.
- Focusing attention on important content.
- Minimizing distractions, such as unnecessary content or advertisements.
- Consistent webpage layout and navigation.
- Familiar elements, such as underlined links blue when not visited and purple when visited.
- Dividing processes into logical, essential steps with progress indicators.
- Website authentication as easy as possible without compromising security.
- Making forms easy to complete, such as with clear error messages and simple error recovery.

### Notes

- Designing with [cognitive accessibility](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Guides/Cognitive_accessibility) will lead to good design practices. They will benefit everyone.
- Many people with cognitive impairments also have physical disabilities. Websites must conform to the W3C's [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/), including [cognitive accessibility guidelines](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Guides/Cognitive_accessibility#wcag_guidelines).
- The W3C's [Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/coga/) produces web accessibility guidelines for people with cognitive impairments.
- WebAIM has a [Cognitive page](https://webaim.org/articles/cognitive/) of relevant information and resources.
- The United States Centers for Disease Control estimate that, as of 2018, 1 in 4 US citizens have a disability and, of them, [cognitive impairment is the most common for young people](https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/media/releases/2018/p0816-disability.html).
- In the US, some intellectual disabilities have historically been referred to as "mental retardation." Many now consider this term disparaging, so its use should be avoided.
- In the UK, some intellectual disabilities are referred to as "learning disabilities" or "learning difficulties".

## Implementing accessibility into your project

A common accessibility myth is that accessibility is an expensive "added extra" to implement on a project. This myth actually _can_ be true if either:

- You are trying to "retrofit" accessibility onto an existing website that has significant accessibility issues.
- You have only started to consider accessibility and uncovered related issues in the late stages of a project.

If however, you consider accessibility from the start of a project, the cost of making most content accessible should be fairly minimal.

When planning your project, factor accessibility testing into your testing regime, just like testing for any other important target audience segment (e.g., target desktop or mobile browsers). Test early and often, ideally running automated tests to pick up on programmatically detectable missing features (such as missing image [alternative text](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/HTML#text_alternatives) or bad link text — see [Use meaningful text labels](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/HTML#use_meaningful_text_labels)) and doing some testing with disabled user groups to see how well more complex site features work for them. For example:

- Is my date picker widget usable by people using screen readers?
- If content updates dynamically, do visually impaired people know about it?
- Are my UI buttons accessible to both keyboard and touch interface users?

You can and should keep a note of potential problem areas in your content that will need work to make it accessible, make sure it is tested thoroughly, and think about solutions/alternatives. Text content (as you'll see in the next article) is easy, but what about your multimedia content, and your whizzy 3D graphics? You should look at your project budget and think about what solutions you have available to make such content accessible. Having all your multimedia content transcribed is one option which, while expensive, is possible.

Also, be realistic. "100% accessibility" is an unobtainable ideal — you will always come across some kind of edge case that results in a certain user finding certain content difficult to use — but you should do as much as you can. If you are planning to include a whizzy 3D pie chart graphic made using WebGL, you might want to include a data table as an accessible alternative representation of the data. Or, you might want to just include the table and get rid of the 3D pie chart — the table is accessible by everyone, quicker to code, less CPU-intensive, and easier to maintain.

On the other hand, if you are working on a gallery website showing interesting 3D art, it would be unreasonable to expect every piece of art to be perfectly accessible to visually impaired people, given that it is an entirely visual medium.

To show that you care and have thought about accessibility, publish an accessibility statement on your site that details what your policy is toward accessibility, and what steps you have taken toward making the site accessible. If someone does notify you that your site has an accessibility problem, start a dialog with them, be empathetic, and take reasonable steps to try to fix the problem.

To summarize:

- Consider accessibility from the start of a project, and test early and often. Just like any other bug, an accessibility problem becomes more expensive to fix the later it is discovered.
- Bear in mind that a lot of accessibility best practices benefit everyone, not just users with disabilities. For example, lean semantic markup is not only good for screen readers, but it is also fast to load and performant. This benefits everyone, especially those on mobile devices and/or slow connections.
- Publish an accessibility statement on your site and engage with people having problems.

## Accessibility guidelines and the law

There are numerous checklists and sets of guidelines available for basing accessibility tests on, which might seem overwhelming at first glance. Our advice is to familiarize yourself with the basic areas in which you need to take care, as well as understanding the high-level structures of the guidelines that are most relevant to you.

- For a start, the W3C has published a large and very detailed document that includes very precise, technology-agnostic criteria for accessibility conformance. These are called the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) (WCAG), and they are not a short read by any means. The criteria are split up into four main categories, which specify how implementations can be made perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. The best place to get a light introduction and start learning is [WCAG at a Glance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/). There is no need to learn all of the WCAG criteria — be aware of the major areas of concern, and use a variety of techniques and tools to highlight any areas that don't conform to the WCAG criteria (see below for more).
- Your country may also have specific legislation governing the need for websites serving their population to be accessible — for example [EN 301 549](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/02.01.02_60/en_301549v020102p.pdf) in the EU, [Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act](https://www.section508.gov/training/) in the US, [Federal Ordinance on Barrier-Free Information Technology](https://www.aktion-mensch.de/inklusion/barrierefreiheit/barrierefreie-website) in Germany, the [Accessibility Regulations 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/introduction/made) in the UK, [Accessibilità](https://www.agid.gov.it/it/ambiti-intervento/accessibilita-usabilita) in Italy, the [Disability Discrimination Act](https://humanrights.gov.au/our-work/disability-rights/publications/guidelines-equal-access-digital-goods-and-services) in Australia, etc. The W3C keeps a list of [Web Accessibility Laws & Policies](https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/) by country.

So while the WCAG is a set of guidelines, your country will probably have laws governing web accessibility, or at least the accessibility of services available to the public (which could include websites, television, physical spaces, etc.) It is a good idea to find out what your laws are. If you make no effort to check that your content is accessible, you could be legally liable if people complain.

This sounds serious, but really you just need to consider accessibility as the main priority of your web development practices, as outlined above. If in doubt, get advice from a qualified lawyer. We're not going to offer any more advice than this, because we're not lawyers.

## Accessibility APIs

Web browsers make use of special **accessibility APIs** (provided by the underlying operating system) that expose information useful for assistive technologies (ATs) — ATs mostly tend to make use of semantic information, so this information doesn't include things like styling information, or JavaScript. This information is structured in a tree of information called the **accessibility tree**.

Different operating systems have different accessibility APIs available:

- Windows: MSAA/IAccessible, UIAExpress, IAccessible2
- macOS: NSAccessibility
- Linux: AT-SPI
- Android: Accessibility framework
- iOS: UIAccessibility

Where the native semantic information provided by the HTML elements in your web apps falls down, you can supplement it with features from the [WAI-ARIA specification](https://w3c.github.io/aria/), which add semantic information to the accessibility tree to improve accessibility. You can learn a lot more about WAI-ARIA in our [WAI-ARIA basics](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/WAI-ARIA_basics) article.

## Summary

This article should have given you a useful high-level overview of accessibility, shown you why it's important, and looked at how you can fit it into your workflow. You should now also have a thirst to learn about the implementation details that can make sites accessible, and what tools can help. We'll look at accessibility tooling in the next article.
