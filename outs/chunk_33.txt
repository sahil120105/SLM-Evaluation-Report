# forced-color-adjust

The **`forced-color-adjust`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property allows authors to opt certain elements out of forced colors mode. This then restores the control of those values to CSS.

## Syntax

```css
forced-color-adjust: auto;
forced-color-adjust: none;
forced-color-adjust: preserve-parent-color;

/* Global values */
forced-color-adjust: inherit;
forced-color-adjust: initial;
forced-color-adjust: revert;
forced-color-adjust: revert-layer;
forced-color-adjust: unset;
```

The `forced-color-adjust` property's value must be one of the following keywords.

### Values

- `auto`
  - : The element's colors are adjusted by the {{Glossary("user agent")}} in forced colors mode. This is the default value.
- `none`
  - : The element's colors are not automatically adjusted by the {{Glossary("user agent")}} in forced colors mode.
- `preserve-parent-color`
  - : In forced colors mode, if the {{cssxref("color")}} property inherits from its parent (i.e., there is no [cascaded value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Cascade) or the cascaded value is `currentColor`, {{cssxref("inherit")}}, or another keyword that inherits from the parent), then it computes to the [used color](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Value_processing#used_value) of its parent's `color` property. In all other cases, it behaves the same as `none`.

## Usage notes

This property should only be used to makes changes that will support a user's color and contrast requirements. For example, if you become aware that the color optimizations made by the {{Glossary("user agent")}} result in a poor experience when in a high contrast or dark mode. Using this property would enable tweaking of the result in that mode to provide a better experience. **It should not be used to prevent user choices being respected**.

## Examples

### Preserving colors

In the example below the first box will use the color scheme that the user has set. For example in Windows High Contrast mode black scheme it will have a black background and white text. The second box will preserve the site colors set on the `.box` class.

By using the {{cssxref("@media/forced-colors", "forced-colors")}} media feature, you could add any other optimizations for forced color mode alongside the `forced-color-adjust` property.

#### CSS

```css
.box {
  border: 5px solid grey;
  background-color: #cccccc;
  width: 300px;
  margin: 20px;
  padding: 10px;
}

@media (forced-colors: active) {
  .forced {
    forced-color-adjust: none;
  }
}
```

#### HTML

```html
<div class="box">
  <p>This is a box which should use your color preferences.</p>
</div>

<div class="box forced">
  <p>This is a box which should stay the colors set by the site.</p>
</div>
```

#### Result

# <frequency-percentage>

The **`<frequency-percentage>`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [data type](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_and_units/CSS_data_types) represents a value that can be either a {{Cssxref("frequency")}} or a {{Cssxref("percentage")}}. Frequency values, e.g., the pitch of a speaking voice, are not currently used in any CSS properties.

## Syntax

The value of a `<frequency-percentage>` is either a {{Cssxref("frequency")}} or a {{Cssxref("percentage")}}; see their individual reference pages for details about their syntaxes.

## Description

### Use in calc()

Where a `<frequency-percentage>` is specified as an allowable type, this means that the percentage resolves to a frequency and therefore can be used in a [`calc()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc) expression.

## Formal syntax

{{csssyntax}}

## Examples

### Valid percentage values

```plain example-good
90% Positive percentage
+90% Positive percentage with leading +
-90% Negative percentage — not valid for all properties that use percentages
```

### Invalid percentage values

```plain example-bad
90 % No space is allowed between the number and the unit
```

### Valid frequency values

```plain example-good
12Hz     Positive integer
4.3Hz    Non-integer
14KhZ    The unit is case-insensitive, though non-SI capitalization is not recommended.
+0Hz     Zero, with a leading + and a unit
-0kHz    Zero, with a leading - and a unit
```

### Invalid frequency values

```plain example-bad
12.0     This is a <number>, not an <frequency>, because it is missing a unit.
7 Hz     No space is allowed between the number and the unit.
0        Although unitless zero is an allowable <length>, it's an invalid <frequency>.

# <frequency>

The **`<frequency>`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [data type](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_and_units/CSS_data_types) represents a frequency dimension, such as the pitch of a speaking voice. It is not currently used in any CSS properties.

## Syntax

The `<frequency>` data type consists of a {{cssxref("&lt;number&gt;")}} followed by one of the units listed below. As with all CSS dimensions, there is no space between the unit literal and the number.

### Units

- `Hz`
  - : Represents a frequency in hertz. Examples: `0Hz`, `1500Hz`, `10000Hz`.
- `kHz`
  - : Represents a frequency in kilohertz. Examples: `0kHz`, `1.5kHz`, `10kHz`.

> [!NOTE]
> Although the number `0` is always the same regardless of unit, the unit may not be omitted. In other words, `0` is invalid and does not represent `0Hz` or `0kHz`. Though the units are case-insensitive, it is good practice to use a capital "H" for `Hz` and `kHz`, as specified in the [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units).

## Examples

Valid frequency values:

```plain example-good
12Hz     Positive integer
4.3Hz    Non-integer
14KhZ    The unit is case-insensitive, though non-SI capitalization is not recommended.
+0Hz     Zero, with a leading + and a unit
-0kHz    Zero, with a leading - and a unit
```

Invalid frequency values:

```plain example-bad
12.0     This is a <number>, not an <frequency>, because it is missing a unit.
7 Hz     No space is allowed between the number and the unit.
0        Although unitless zero is an allowable <length>, it's an invalid <frequency>.

# gap

The **`gap`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [shorthand property](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Shorthand_properties) sets the gaps (also called {{glossary("gutters")}}) between rows and columns. This property applies to [multi-column](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_multicol_layout), [flex](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout), and [grid](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout) containers.

## Constituent properties

This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:

- {{cssxref("column-gap")}}
- {{cssxref("row-gap")}}

## Syntax

```css
/* One <length> value */
gap: 20px;
gap: 1em;
gap: 3vmin;
gap: 0.5cm;

/* One <percentage> value */
gap: 16%;
gap: 100%;

/* Two <length> values */
gap: 20px 10px;
gap: 1em 0.5em;
gap: 3vmin 2vmax;
gap: 0.5cm 2mm;

/* One or two <percentage> values */
gap: 16% 100%;
gap: 21px 82%;

/* calc() values */
gap: calc(10% + 20px);
gap: calc(20px + 10%) calc(10% - 5px);

/* Global values */
gap: inherit;
gap: initial;
gap: revert;
gap: revert-layer;
gap: unset;
```

### Values

This property is specified as a value for `<'row-gap'>`, followed optionally by a value for `<'column-gap'>`. If `<'column-gap'>` is omitted, it is set to the same value as `<'row-gap'>`. Both `<'row-gap'>` and `<'column-gap'>` can each be specified as a `<length>` or a `<percentage>`.

- {{CSSxRef("&lt;length&gt;")}}
  - : Specifies the width of the gutter separating columns, {{glossary("flex item","flex items")}}, flex lines, and {{glossary("grid lines")}}.
- {{CSSxRef("&lt;percentage&gt;")}}
  - : Specifies the width of the gutter separating columns, flex items, flex lines, and grid lines relative to the dimension of the element.

## Description

This property defines gaps between columns in [CSS multi-column layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_multicol_layout), between flex items and flex lines in [CSS flexible box layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout), and between rows and columns in [CSS grid layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout).

The generated gaps create empty spaces that have the width or height of the gap's specified size, much like an empty item or track. The visible space between elements may differ from the provided `gap` value because margins, padding, and distributed alignment may increase the separation between elements beyond what is determined by `gap`.

In grid layout, the first value defines the gutter between rows, and the second defines the gutter between columns. In both grid and flex layouts, if only one value is included, that value is used for both dimensions.

With flex containers, whether the first value is the gap between flex items or between flex lines depends on the direction. Flex items are laid out in either rows or columns depending on the value of the {{cssxref("flex-direction")}} property. For rows (`row` (the default) or `row-reverse`), the first value defines the gap between flex lines, and the second value defines the gap between items within each line. For columns (`column` or `column-reverse`), the first value defines the gap between flex items within a flex line, and the second value defines the gaps between each flex line.

In multi-column containers, the first value defines the gap between columns. A dividing line can be added to the otherwise "empty space" by using the {{cssxref("column-rule-style")}} property or {{cssxref("column-rule")}} shorthand.

Percentage gap values are always calculated against the [content box](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Box_model#parts_of_a_box) size of the container element. The behavior is well-defined and consistent across layout modes when the container size is definite. As these three layout modes (multi-column, flex, and grid) treat cyclic percentage sizes differently, `gap` also does so. In grid layout, cyclic percentage sizes resolve against zero for determining {{glossary("intrinsic size")}} contributions but resolve against the element's content box when laying out the contents. Two examples below demonstrate percentage gap values with [explicit container size](#percentage_gap_value_and_explicit_container_size) and [implicit container size](#percentage_gap_value_and_implicit_container_size) in the examples section.

Early versions of the specification called this property `grid-gap`, and to maintain compatibility with legacy websites, browsers still accept `grid-gap` as an alias for `gap`.

### Flex layout

#### HTML

```html
<div id="flexbox">
  <div></div>
  <div></div>
  <div></div>
  <div></div>
  <div></div>
  <div></div>
</div>
```

#### CSS

```css

  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  width: 300px;
  gap: 20px 5px;
}

#flexbox > div {
  border: 1px solid green;
  background-color: lime;
  flex: 1 1 auto;
  width: 100px;
  height: 50px;
}
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Flex_layout", "auto", 250)}}

### Grid layout

#### HTML

```html
<div id="grid">
  <div></div>
  <div></div>
  <div></div>
  <div></div>
  <div></div>
  <div></div>
  <div></div>
  <div></div>
  <div></div>
</div>
```

#### CSS

```css
#grid {
  display: grid;
  height: 200px;
  grid-template: repeat(3, 1fr) / repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 20px 5px;
}

#grid > div {
  border: 1px solid green;
  background-color: lime;
}
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Grid_layout", "auto", 250)}}

### Multi-column layout

#### HTML

```html
<p class="content-box">
  This is some multi-column text with a 40px column gap created with the CSS
  <code>gap</code> property. Don't you think that's fun and exciting? I sure do!
</p>
```

#### CSS

```css
.content-box {
  column-count: 3;
  gap: 40px;
}
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Multi-column_layout", "auto", "120px")}}

### Percentage gap value and explicit container size

If the container has a fixed size set, then gap percentage value calculations are based on the size of the container. Thus, gap behavior is consistent across all layouts. In the following example, there are two containers, one with a grid layout and the other with a flex layout. The containers have five red 20x20px children. Both containers are explicitly set to 200px high using `height: 200px` and the gap is set with `gap: 12.5% 0`.

```html
<span>Grid</span>
<div id="grid">
  <div>1</div>
  <div>2</div>
  <div>3</div>
  <div>4</div>
  <div>5</div>
</div>
<span>Flex</span>
<div id="flex">
  <div>1</div>
  <div>2</div>
  <div>3</div>
  <div>4</div>
  <div>5</div>
</div>
```

```css hidden
body > div {
  background-color: #cccccc;
  width: 200px;
  flex-flow: column;
}
```

```css
#grid {
  display: inline-grid;
  height: 200px;
  gap: 12.5% 0;
}

#flex {
  display: inline-flex;
  height: 200px;
  gap: 12.5% 0;
}

#grid > div,
#flex > div {
  background-color: coral;
  width: 20px;
  height: 20px;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Explicit container size", "auto", "200px")}}

Now inspect the grid and flex elements using [Inspector tab in Web Developer Tools](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/page_inspector/how_to/open_the_inspector/index.html). In order to see the actual gaps hover mouse over `<div id="grid">` and `<div id="flex">` tags in the inspector. You will notice that the gap is the same in both cases which is 25px.

### Percentage gap value and implicit container size

If size is not explicitly set on the container, then the percentage gap behaves differently in case of grid and flex layouts. In the following example the containers don't have height explicitly set.

```html hidden
<span>Grid</span>
<div id="grid">
  <div>1</div>
  <div>2</div>
  <div>3</div>
  <div>4</div>
  <div>5</div>
</div>
<span>Flex</span>
<div id="flex">
  <div>1</div>
  <div>2</div>
  <div>3</div>
  <div>4</div>
  <div>5</div>
</div>
```

```css hidden
body > div {
  background-color: #cccccc;
  width: 200px;
}

#grid {
  display: inline-grid;
  gap: 12.5% 0;
}

#flex {
  display: inline-flex;
  gap: 12.5% 0;
  flex-flow: column;
}

#grid > div,
#flex > div {
  background-color: coral;
  width: 20px;
  height: 20px;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Implicit container size", "auto", "200px")}}

In case of the grid layout, percentage gap doesn't contribute to the actual height of the grid. The container's height is calculated using `0px` gap, so the actual height turns out to be 100px (20px x 5). Then the actual percentage gap is calculated using the content box's height, the gap turns out to be `12.5px` (100px x 12.5%). The gap is applied just before rendering. Thus the grid remains 100px high but it overflows due to the percentage gap added later just before rendering.

In case of the flex layout, the percentage gap always results in zero value.

# <generic-family>

The **`<generic-family>`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [data type](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_and_units/CSS_data_types) represents the keyword values for generic font families used in the {{cssxref("font")}} shorthand and {{cssxref("font-family")}} longhand properties. The `<generic-family>` represents one or more locally-installed fonts belonging to that category of fonts.

## Syntax

### Values

The `<generic-family>` {{glossary("enumerated")}} type is specified using one of the values listed below:

- `serif`
  - : A serif is a small line or stroke attached to the end of a larger stroke in a letter. In serif fonts, glyphs have finishing strokes, flared or tapering ends. Examples include Lucida Bright, Lucida Fax, Palatino, Palatino Linotype, Palladio, and URW Palladio.

- `sans-serif`
  - : A font without serifs; glyphs have plain stroke endings, without ornamentation. Example sans-serif fonts include Open Sans, Fira Sans, Lucida Sans, Lucida Sans Unicode, Trebuchet MS, Liberation Sans, and Nimbus Sans L.

- `monospace`
  - : All glyphs have the same fixed width. Example monospace fonts include Fira Mono, DejaVu Sans Mono, Menlo, Consolas, Liberation Mono, Monaco, and Lucida Console.

- `cursive`
  - : Glyphs in cursive fonts generally use a cursive script or other handwriting style, and the result looks more like handwritten pen or brush writing than printed typesetting. CSS uses the term "cursive" to apply to a font for any script, including those that do not have joining strokes. Example cursive fonts include Brush Script MT, Brush Script Std, Lucida Calligraphy, Lucida Handwriting, and Apple Chancery.

- `fantasy`
  - : Fantasy fonts are primarily decorative fonts that contain playful representations of characters. Example fantasy fonts include Papyrus, Herculanum, Party LET, Curlz MT, Harrington, and Comic Sans MS.

- `system-ui`
  - : Glyphs are taken from the default user interface font on a given platform. Because typographic traditions vary widely across the world, this generic family is provided for typefaces that don't map cleanly into the others.
    > [!NOTE]
    > As the name implies, `system-ui` is intended to make UI elements look like native apps, and not for typesetting large paragraphs of text. It may cause the displayed typeface to be undesirable for some users—for example, the default Windows CJK font may render Latin scripts poorly, and the `lang` attribute may not affect the displayed font. Some operating systems do not allow customizing `system-ui`, while browsers generally allow customizing the `sans-serif` font family. For large paragraphs, use `sans-serif` or some other non-UI font family instead.

- `ui-serif`
  - : The default user interface serif font. See the definition of `serif` above.

- `ui-sans-serif`
  - : The default user interface sans-serif font. See the definition of `sans-serif` above.

- `ui-monospace`
  - : The default user interface monospace font. See the definition of `monospace` above.

- `ui-rounded`
  - : The default user interface font that has rounded features.

- `math`
  - : Fonts for displaying mathematical expressions, for example superscript and subscript, brackets that cross several lines, nesting expressions, and double-struck glyphs with distinct meanings.

- `fangsong`
  - : A particular style of Chinese characters that are between serif-style Song and cursive-style Kai forms. This style is often used for government documents.

## Formal syntax

{{CSSSyntaxRaw(`<generic-family> = serif | sans-serif | monospace | cursive | fantasy | system-ui | ui-serif | ui-sans-serif | ui-monospace | ui-rounded | math | fangsong`)}}

## Examples

This example demos several of the `<generic-family>` enumerated values for the {{cssxref("font-family")}} property.

### HTML

```html
<ul>
  <li class="serif">serif</li>
  <li class="sans-serif">sans-serif</li>
  <li class="monospace">monospace</li>
  <li class="cursive">cursive</li>
  <li class="fantasy">fantasy</li>
  <li class="system-ui">system-ui</li>
</ul>
```

### CSS

```css
ul {
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  line-height: 2;
}
.serif {
  font-family: serif;
}
.sans-serif {
  font-family: sans-serif;

# conic-gradient()

The **`conic-gradient()`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [function](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_and_units/CSS_value_functions) creates an image consisting of a gradient with color transitions rotated around a center point (rather than radiating from the center). Example conic gradients include pie charts and {{glossary("color wheel", "color wheels")}}. The result of the `conic-gradient()` function is an object of the {{CSSxRef("&lt;gradient&gt;")}} data type, which is a special kind of {{CSSxRef("&lt;image&gt;")}}.

)
```

### Values

- {{CSSxRef("&lt;angle&gt;")}}
  - : Preceded by the `from` keyterm, and taking an angle as its value, defines the gradient rotation in clockwise direction.
- `<position>`
  - : Using the same length, order, and keyterm values as the [`background-position`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position) property, the `position` value defines center of the gradient. If not specified, the value used for `position` by default is `center`, meaning the gradient will be centered.
- `<angular-color-stop>`
  - : A color-stop's {{CSSxRef("&lt;color&gt;")}} value, followed by one or two optional stop positions, (an {{CSSxRef("&lt;angle&gt;")}} along the gradient's circumference axis).
- `<color-hint>`
  - : An {{Glossary("interpolation")}} hint defining how the gradient progresses between adjacent color stops. The length defines at which point between two color stops the gradient color should reach the midpoint of the color transition. If omitted, the midpoint of the color transition is the midpoint between two color stops.

> [!NOTE]
> Rendering of color stops in conic gradients follows the same rules as [color stops in linear gradients](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/linear-gradient#composition_of_a_linear_gradient).

## Description

As with any gradient, a conic gradient has [no intrinsic dimensions](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image#description); i.e., it has no natural or preferred size, nor a preferred ratio. Its concrete size will match the size of the element it applies to, or the size of the `<image>` if it is set to something other than the element size.

To create a conic gradient that repeats so as to fill a 360 degree rotation, use the {{CSSxRef("gradient/repeating-conic-gradient", "repeating-conic-gradient()")}} function instead.

Because `<gradient>`s belong to the `<image>` data type, they can only be used where `<image>`s can be used. For this reason, `conic-gradient()` won't work on {{CSSxRef("background-color")}} and other properties that use the {{CSSxRef("&lt;color&gt;")}} data type.

> [!NOTE]
> Why is it called a "conic" gradient? If the color stops are much lighter on one side than the other, it can look like a cone from above.

### Composition of a conic gradient

The conic-gradient syntax is similar to the radial-gradient syntax, but the color-stops are placed around a gradient arc, the circumference of a circle, rather than on the gradient line emerging from the center of the gradient. With conic gradients, the colors transition as if spun around the center of a circle, starting at the top and going clockwise. In a radial gradient, the colors transition from the center of an ellipse, outward, in all directions.

![color stops along the circumference of a conic gradient and the axis of a radial gradient.](screenshot_2018-11-29_21.09.19.png)

A conic gradient is specified by indicating a rotation angle, the center of the gradient, and then specifying a list of color-stops. Unlike linear and radial gradients, whose color-stops are placed by specifying a {{cssxref("length")}}, the color-stops of a conic gradient are specified with an [angle](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/angle). Units include `deg` for degrees, `grad` for gradients, `rad` for radians, and `turn` for turns. There are 360 degrees, 400 gradians, 2π radians, and 1 turn in a circle. Browsers supporting conic gradients also accept percent values, with 100% equaling 360 degrees, but this is not in the specification.

Similar to radial gradients, the conic gradient syntax provides for positioning the center of the gradient anywhere within, or even outside, the image. The values for the position are similar to the syntax for 2-value background-position.

The gradient arc is the circumference of the gradient. The _starting point_ of the gradient or arc is north, or 12:00pm. The gradient is then rotated by the _from_ angle. The colors of the gradient are determined by the angled color stops, their starting points, ending points, and, in between, and optional angled color-stop points. The transitions between colors can be altered with color hints between adjacent colors' color stops.

#### Customizing gradients

By adding more angled color-stop points on the gradient arc, you can create a highly customized transition between multiple colors. A color-stop's position can be explicitly defined by using an {{CSSxRef("&lt;angle&gt;")}}. If you don't specify the location of a color stop, it is placed halfway between the one that precedes it and the one that follows it. If you don't specify an angle for the first or last color stop, their values are 0deg and 360deg respectively. The following two gradients are equivalent:

```css
conic-gradient(red, orange, yellow, green, blue);
conic-gradient(red 0deg, orange 90deg, yellow 180deg, green 270deg, blue 360deg);
```

By default, colors transition smoothly from the color at one color stop to the color at the subsequent color stop, with the midpoint between the colors being the half way point between the color transition. You can move this color transition midpoint to any point between two color stops by adding a color hint, indicating where the middle of the color transition should be. The following is solid red from the start to the 10% mark, transitions from red to blue over 80% of the turn, with the final 10% being solid blue. The midpoint of the red to blue gradient change, however, is at the 20% mark rather than the 50% mark as would have happened without the 80grad, or 20%, color hint.

```css
conic-gradient(red 40grad, 80grad, blue 360grad);
```

If two or more color stops are at the same location, the transition will be a hard line between the first and last colors declared at that location. To use conic gradients to create pie charts — which is NOT the correct way to create pie charts as background images are not accessible — use hard color stops, where the color stop angles for two adjacent color stops are the same. The easiest way to do this is to use multiple position colors stops. The following two declarations are equivalent:

```css
conic-gradient(white 0.09turn, #bbbbbb 0.09turn, #bbbbbb 0.27turn, #666666 0.27turn, #666666 0.54turn, black 0.54turn);
conic-gradient(white 0turn 0.09turn, #bbbbbb 0.09turn 0.27turn, #666666 0.27turn 0.54turn, black 0.54turn 1turn);
```

Color stops should be listed in ascending order. Subsequent color stops of lower value will override the value of the previous color stop creating a hard transition. The following changes from red to yellow at the 30% mark, and then transitions from yellow to blue over 35% of the gradient:

```css
conic-gradient(red .8rad, yellow .6rad, blue 1.3rad);
```

There are other effects you can create with conic gradients. Oddly, a checkerboard is one of them. By creating quadrants with an upper left and lower right white quadrant and lower left and upper right black quadrants, then repeating the gradient 16 times (four times across and four times down) you can make a checkerboard.

```css
conic-gradient(white 90deg, black 0.25turn 0.5turn, white 1rad 1.5rad, black 300grad);
background-size: 25% 25%;
```

And, yes, you can mix and match different angle units, but don't. The above is hard to read.

## Accessibility

Browsers do not provide any special information on background images to assistive technology. This is important primarily for screen readers, as a screen reader will not announce its presence and therefore convey nothing to its users. While it is possible to create pie charts, checkerboards, and other effects with conic gradients, CSS images provide no native way to assign alternative text, and therefore the image represented by the conic gradient will not be accessible to screen reader users. If the image contains information critical to understanding the page's overall purpose, it is better to describe it semantically in the document.

### Gradient at 40-degrees

```css hidden
div {

  height: 100px;
}
```

```html hidden
<div></div>
```

```css

```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Gradient_at_40-degrees", 120, 120)}}

### Off-centered gradient

```css hidden

```

```html hidden
<div></div>
```

```css
div {

}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Off-centered_gradient", 120, 120)}}

### Gradient pie-chart

This example uses multi-position color stops, with adjacent colors having the same color stop value, creating a striped effect.

```css hidden
div {

}
```

```html hidden
<div></div>
```

```css

}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Gradient_pie-chart", 120, 120)}}

### Checkerboard

```css hidden
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}
```

```html hidden
<div></div>
```

```css
div {
  background: conic-gradient(
      white 0.25turn,
      black 0.25turn 0.5turn,
      white 0.5turn 0.75turn,
      black 0.75turn
    )
    top left / 25% 25% repeat;
  border: 1px solid;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Checkerboard", 120, 120)}}

### Interpolating with hue

```html hidden
<div class="shorter"></div>
<div class="longer"></div>
```

```css hidden
div {
  display: inline-block;
  margin-top: 1rem;
  width: 45vw;
  height: 80vh;
}

.shorter::before {
  content: "shorter hue";
  display: block;
  margin-top: -1rem;
}

.longer::before {
  content: "longer hue";
  display: block;
  margin-top: -1rem;
}
```

In this example for interpolation [hsl](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl) color system is being used and [hue](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hue) is being interpolated.

```css
.shorter {
  background-image: conic-gradient(in hsl shorter hue, red, blue);
}

.longer {
  background-image: conic-gradient(in hsl longer hue, red, blue);
}
```

The box on the left uses [shorter interpolation](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hue-interpolation-method#shorter), meaning color goes straight from red to blue using the shorter arc on the [color wheel](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Color_wheel). The box on the right uses [longer interpolation](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hue-interpolation-method#longer), meaning the color goes from red to blue using the longer arc, traversing through greens, yellows, and oranges.

# <gradient>

The **`<gradient>`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [data type](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_and_units/CSS_data_types) is a special type of {{cssxref("&lt;image&gt;")}} that consists of a progressive transition between two or more colors.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: &lt;gradient&gt;")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
background: linear-gradient(#f69d3c, #3f87a6);
```

```css interactive-example-choice

A CSS gradient has [no intrinsic dimensions](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image#description); i.e., it has no natural or preferred size, nor a preferred ratio. Its concrete size will match the size of the element to which it applies.

## Syntax

The `<gradient>` data type is defined with one of the function types listed below.

### Linear gradient

Linear gradients transition colors progressively along an imaginary line. They are generated with the {{cssxref("gradient/linear-gradient", "linear-gradient()")}} function.

### Radial gradient

Radial gradients transition colors progressively from a center point (origin). They are generated with the {{cssxref("gradient/radial-gradient", "radial-gradient()")}} function.

### Conic gradient

Conic gradients transition colors progressively around a circle. They are generated with the {{cssxref("gradient/conic-gradient", "conic-gradient()")}} function.

### Repeating gradient

Repeating gradients duplicate a gradient as much as necessary to fill a given area. They are generated with the {{cssxref("gradient/repeating-linear-gradient", "repeating-linear-gradient()")}}, {{cssxref("gradient/repeating-radial-gradient", "repeating-radial-gradient()")}}, and {{cssxref("gradient/repeating-conic-gradient", "repeating-conic-gradient()")}} functions.

## Interpolation

As with any interpolation involving colors, gradients are calculated in the alpha-premultiplied color space. This prevents unexpected shades of gray from appearing when both the color and the opacity are changing. (Be aware that older browsers may not use this behavior when using the [transparent keyword](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/named-color#transparent).)

### Values

- `<side-or-corner>`
  - : The position of the gradient line's starting point. If specified, it consists of the word `to` and up to two keywords: one indicates the horizontal side (`left` or `right`), and the other the vertical side (`top` or `bottom`). The order of the side keywords does not matter. If unspecified, it defaults to `to bottom`.

    The values `to top`, `to bottom`, `to left`, and `to right` are equivalent to the angles `0deg`, `180deg`, `270deg`, and `90deg`, respectively. The other values are translated into an angle.

- {{CSSxRef("&lt;angle&gt;")}}
  - : The gradient line's angle of direction. A value of `0deg` is equivalent to `to top`; increasing values rotate clockwise from there.
- `<linear-color-stop>`
  - : A color-stop's {{CSSxRef("&lt;color&gt;")}} value, followed by one or two optional stop positions, (each being either a {{CSSxRef("&lt;percentage&gt;")}} or a {{CSSxRef("&lt;length&gt;")}} along the gradient's axis).
- `<color-hint>`
  - : An {{glossary("interpolation")}} hint defining how the gradient progresses between adjacent color stops. The length defines at which point between two color stops the gradient color should reach the midpoint of the color transition. If omitted, the midpoint of the color transition is the midpoint between two color stops.

> [!NOTE]
> Rendering of [color stops in CSS gradients](#composition_of_a_linear_gradient) follows the same rules as color stops in [SVG gradients](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorials/SVG_from_scratch/Gradients).

## Description

As with any gradient, a linear gradient has [no intrinsic dimensions](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image#description); i.e., it has no natural or preferred size, nor a preferred ratio. Its concrete size will match the size of the element it applies to.

To create a linear gradient that repeats to fill its container, use the {{cssxref("gradient/repeating-linear-gradient", "repeating-linear-gradient()")}} function instead.

Because `<gradient>`s belong to the `<image>` data type, they can only be used where [`<image>`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image)s can be used. For this reason, `linear-gradient()` won't work on {{CSSxRef("background-color")}} and other properties that use the {{CSSxRef("&lt;color&gt;")}} data type.

### Composition of a linear gradient

A linear gradient is defined by an axis—the _gradient line_—and two or more _color-stop points_. Each point on the axis is a distinct color; to create a smooth gradient, the `linear-gradient()` function draws a series of colored lines perpendicular to the gradient line, each one matching the color of the point where it intersects the gradient line.

![linear-gradient.png](linear-gradient.png)

The gradient line is defined by the center of the box containing the gradient image and by an angle. The colors of the gradient are determined by two or more points: the starting point, the ending point, and, in between, optional color-stop points.

The _starting point_ is the location on the gradient line where the first color begins. The _ending point_ is the point where the last color ends. Each of these two points is defined by the intersection of the gradient line with a perpendicular line passing from the box corner which is in the same quadrant. The ending point can be understood as the symmetrical point of the starting point. These somewhat complex definitions lead to an interesting effect sometimes called _magic corners_: the corners nearest to the starting and ending points have the same color as their respective starting or ending points.

#### Customizing Gradients

By adding more color-stop points on the gradient line, you can create a highly customized transition between multiple colors. A color-stop's position can be explicitly defined by using a {{CSSxRef("&lt;length&gt;")}} or a {{CSSxRef("&lt;percentage&gt;")}}. If you don't specify the location of a color, it is placed halfway between the one that precedes it and the one that follows it. The following two gradients are equivalent.

```css
linear-gradient(red, orange, yellow, green, blue);
linear-gradient(red 0%, orange 25%, yellow 50%, green 75%, blue 100%);
```

By default, colors transition smoothly from the color at one color-stop to the color at the subsequent color-stop, with the midpoint between the colors being the halfway point between the color transition. You can move this midpoint to any position between two color-stops by adding an unlabelled % color hint between the two colors to indicate where the middle of the color transition should be. The following example is solid red from the start to the 10% mark and solid blue from 90% to the end. Between 10% and 90% the color transitions from red to blue, however, the midpoint of the transition is at the 30% mark rather than 50% as would have happened without the 30% color hint.

```css
linear-gradient(red 10%, 30%, blue 90%);
```

If two or more color-stops are at the same location, the transition will be a hard line between the first and last colors declared at that location.

Color-stops should be listed in ascending order. Subsequent color-stops of lower value will override the value of the previous color-stop creating a hard transition. The following changes from red to yellow at the 40% mark, and then transitions from yellow to blue over 25% of the gradient:

```css
linear-gradient(red 40%, yellow 30%, blue 65%);
```

Multi-position color-stops are allowed. A color can be declared as two adjacent color-stops by including both positions in the CSS declaration. The following three gradients are equivalent:

```css
linear-gradient(red 0%, orange 10%, orange 30%, yellow 50%, yellow 70%, green 90%, green 100%);
linear-gradient(red, orange 10% 30%, yellow 50% 70%, green 90%);
linear-gradient(red 0%, orange 10% 30%, yellow 50% 70%, green 90% 100%);
```

By default, if there is no color with a `0%` stop, the first color declared will be at that point. Similarly, the last color will continue to the `100%` mark, or be at the `100%` mark if no length has been declared on that last stop.

### Interpolating with hue

```html hidden
<div class="shorter">shorter hue</div>
<div class="longer">longer hue</div>
```

```css hidden
div {
  height: 50vh;
  color: white;
  font-weight: bolder;
}
```

In this example for interpolation, [hsl](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl) color system is being used and [hue](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hue) is being interpolated.

```css
.shorter {
  background: linear-gradient(90deg in hsl shorter hue, red, blue);
}

.longer {
  background: linear-gradient(90deg in hsl longer hue, red, blue);
}
```

The box on the top uses [shorter interpolation](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hue-interpolation-method#shorter), meaning color goes straight from red to blue using the shorter arc on [color wheel](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Color_wheel). The box on the bottom uses [longer interpolation](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hue-interpolation-method#longer), meaning the color goes from red to blue using the longer arc, traversing through greens, yellows, and oranges.

### Gradient with multi-position color-stops

This example uses multi-position color-stops, with adjacent colors having the same color-stop value, creating a striped effect.

```css hidden
body {
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

```css
body {
  background: linear-gradient(
    to right,
    red 20%,
    orange 20% 40%,
    yellow 40% 60%,
    green 60% 80%,
    blue 80%
  );
}
```

# radial-gradient()

The **`radial-gradient()`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [function](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_and_units/CSS_value_functions) creates an image consisting of a progressive transition between two or more colors that radiate from an origin. Its shape may be a circle or an ellipse. The function's result is an object of the {{cssxref("&lt;gradient&gt;")}} data type, which is a special kind of {{cssxref("&lt;image&gt;")}}.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: radial-gradient()")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
background: radial-gradient(#e66465, #9198e5);
```

```css interactive-example-choice

```

```css interactive-example-choice

  #333333,
  #333333 50%,
  #eeeeee 75%,
  #333333 75%
);
```

```css interactive-example-choice

}
```

## Syntax

```css
/* A gradient with a single color of red */
radial-gradient(red)

/* A gradient at the center of its container,
   starting red, changing to blue, and finishing green */
radial-gradient(circle at center, red 0, blue, green 100%)

/* hsl color space with longer hue interpolation */
radial-gradient(circle at center in hsl longer hue, red 0, blue, green 100%)
```

A radial gradient is specified by indicating the center of the gradient (where the 0% ellipse will be) and the size and shape of the _ending shape_ (the 100% ellipse).

### Values

- {{cssxref("&lt;position&gt;")}}
  - : The position of the gradient, interpreted in the same way as {{cssxref("background-position")}} or {{cssxref("transform-origin")}}. If unspecified, it defaults to `center`.
- `<ending-shape>`
  - : The gradient's ending-shape. The value can be `circle` (meaning that the gradient's shape is a circle with a constant radius) or `ellipse` (meaning that the shape is an axis-aligned ellipse). If unspecified, it defaults to `ellipse`.
- `<size>`
  - : Determines the size of the gradient's ending shape. If omitted it defaults to farthest-corner. It can be given explicitly or by keyword. For the purpose of the keyword definitions, consider the gradient box edges as extending infinitely in both directions, rather than being finite line segments.

    Both circle and ellipse gradients accept the following keywords for their `<size>`:

    | Keyword           | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
    | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `closest-side`    | The gradient's ending shape meets the side of the box closest to its center (for circles) or meets both the vertical and horizontal sides closest to the center (for ellipses). |
    | `closest-corner`  | The gradient's ending shape is sized so that it exactly meets the closest corner of the box from its center.                                                                    |
    | `farthest-side`   | Similar to `closest-side`, except the ending shape is sized to meet the side of the box farthest from its center (or vertical and horizontal sides).                            |
    | `farthest-corner` | The default value, the gradient's ending shape is sized so that it exactly meets the farthest corner of the box from its center.                                                |

    If `<ending-shape>` is specified as `circle`, the size may be given explicitly as a {{cssxref("length")}}, which provides an explicit circle radius. Negative values are invalid.

    If `<ending-shape>` is specified as `ellipse`, the size may be given as a {{cssxref("length-percentage")}} with two values to provide an explicit ellipse size. The first value represents the horizontal radius and the second is the vertical radius. Percentage values are relative to the corresponding dimension of the gradient box. Negative values are invalid.

    When the `<ending-shape>` keyword is omitted, the gradient shape is determined by the size given. One `<length>` value provides a circle, while two values in `<length-percentage>` units provide an ellipse. A single `<percentage>` value is not valid.

- `<linear-color-stop>`
  - : A color-stop's {{cssxref("&lt;color&gt;")}} value, followed by one or two optional stop positions (either a {{cssxref("&lt;percentage&gt;")}} or a {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}} along the gradient's axis). A percentage of `0%`, or a length of `0`, represents the center of the gradient; the value `100%` represents the intersection of the ending shape with the virtual gradient ray. Percentage values in between are linearly positioned on the gradient ray. Including two stop positions is equivalent to declaring two color stops with the same color at the two positions.
- `<color-hint>`
  - : The color-hint is an interpolation hint defining how the gradient progresses between adjacent color stops. The length defines at which point between two color stops the gradient color should reach the midpoint of the color transition. If omitted, the midpoint of the color transition is the midpoint between two color stops.

## Description

As with any gradient, a radial gradient has [no intrinsic dimensions](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image#description); i.e., it has no natural or preferred size, nor a preferred ratio. Its concrete size will match the size of the element it applies to.

To create a radial gradient that repeats so as to fill its container, use the {{cssxref("gradient/repeating-radial-gradient", "repeating-radial-gradient()")}} function instead.

Because `<gradient>`s belong to the `<image>` data type, they can only be used where `<image>`s can be used. For this reason, `radial-gradient()` won't work on {{Cssxref("background-color")}} and other properties that use the {{cssxref("&lt;color&gt;")}} data type.

### Composition of a radial gradient

![Graph explaining radial gradients: the virtual radiant ray is horizontal starting from the midpoint. The elliptical gradient, and therefore the ending shape, has the same aspect ratio as the box upon which it is declared.](radial_gradient.png)

A radial gradient is defined by a _center point_, an _ending shape_, and two or more _color-stop points_.

To create a smooth gradient, the `radial-gradient()` function draws a series of concentric shapes radiating out from the center to the _ending shape_ (and potentially beyond). The ending shape may be either a circle or an ellipse.

Color-stop points are positioned on a _virtual gradient ray_ that extends horizontally from the center towards the right. Percentage-based color-stop positions are relative to the intersection between the ending shape and this gradient ray, which represents `100%`. Each shape is a single color determined by the color on the gradient ray it intersects.

### Interpolating with hue

```html hidden
<div class="shorter"></div>
<div class="longer"></div>
```

```css hidden
div {
  display: inline-block;
  margin-top: 1rem;
  width: 45vw;
  height: 80vh;
}

.shorter::before {
  content: "shorter hue";
  display: block;
  margin-top: -1rem;
}

.longer::before {
  content: "longer hue";
  display: block;
  margin-top: -1rem;
}
```

In this example for interpolation, [hsl](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl) color system is being used and [hue](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hue) is being interpolated.

```css
.shorter {
  background-image: radial-gradient(
    circle at center in hsl shorter hue,
    red,
    blue
  );
}

.longer {
  background-image: radial-gradient(
    circle at center in hsl longer hue,
    red,
    blue
  );
}
```

The box on the left uses [shorter interpolation](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hue-interpolation-method#shorter), meaning the color goes straight from red to blue using the shorter arc on [color wheel](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Color_wheel). The box on the right uses [longer interpolation](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hue-interpolation-method#longer), meaning the color goes from red to blue using the longer arc, traversing through greens, yellows, and oranges.

# repeating-conic-gradient()

The **`repeating-conic-gradient()`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [function](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_and_units/CSS_value_functions) creates an image consisting of a repeating gradient (rather than a [single gradient](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/conic-gradient)) with color transitions rotated around a center point (rather than [radiating from the center](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/repeating-radial-gradient)).

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: repeating-conic-gradient()")}}

```css interactive-example-choice

## Syntax

```css
/* Starburst: a blue on blue starburst: the gradient
   is a starburst of lighter and darker blue,
   centered in the upper left quadrant,
   offset by 3degrees so there is no up/down straight line */
repeating-conic-gradient(

  hsl(200 100% 50%) 0deg 15deg,
  hsl(200 100% 60%) 10deg 30deg
)

/* Interpolation in polar color space
  with longer hue interpolation method */
repeating-conic-gradient(in hsl shorter hue, red, blue 90deg, green 180deg)
```

### Values

- {{CSSxRef("&lt;angle&gt;")}}
  - : Preceded by the `from` keyterm, and taking an angle as its value, defines the gradient rotation in clockwise direction.
- `<position>`
  - : Using the same length, order and keyterm values as the [background-position](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position) property, the position defines center of the gradient. If omitted, the default value is `center`, meaning the gradient will be centered.
- `<angular-color-stop>`
  - : A color-stop's {{CSSxRef("&lt;color&gt;")}} value, followed by one or two optional stop positions, (an {{CSSxRef("&lt;angle&gt;")}} along the gradient's circumference axis). The last color stop minus the first color-stop angle defines the size of the repeating gradient.
- `<color-hint>`
  - : An {{Glossary("interpolation")}} hint defining how the gradient progresses between adjacent color stops. The length defines at which point between two color stops the gradient color should reach the midpoint of the color transition. If omitted, the midpoint of the color transition is the midpoint between two color stops.

> [!NOTE]
> Rendering of color stops in repeating conic gradients follows the same rules as [color stops in linear gradients](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/linear-gradient#composition_of_a_linear_gradient).

## Description

Example repeating conic gradients include starbursts. The result of the `repeating-conic-gradient()` function is an object of the {{CSSxRef("&lt;gradient&gt;")}} data type, which is a special kind of {{CSSxRef("&lt;image&gt;")}}.

If neither the first nor the last color stops include a color stop angle greater than 0deg or less than 360 degrees respectively, the conic-gradient will not repeat.

As with any gradient, a repeating-conic gradient has [no intrinsic dimensions](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image#description); i.e., it has no natural or preferred size, nor a preferred ratio. Its concrete size will match the size of the element it applies to, or the size the `<image>` is set to if it's set to something other than the element's size.

Because `<gradient>`s belong to the `<image>` data type, they can only be used where `<image>`s can be used. For this reason, `repeating-conic-gradient()` won't work on {{CSSxRef("background-color")}} and other properties that use the {{CSSxRef("&lt;color&gt;")}} data type.

> [!NOTE]
> To create a conic gradient that does not repeat, make the gradient a full 360 degree rotation, or use the {{cssxref("gradient/conic-gradient", "conic-gradient()")}} function instead.

### Understanding repeating conic gradients

The repeating-conic-gradient syntax is similar to the {{cssxref("gradient/conic-gradient", "conic-gradient()")}} and {{cssxref("gradient/repeating-radial-gradient", "repeating-radial-gradient()")}} syntax. Like the non-repeating conic-gradient, the color-stops are placed around a gradient arc. Like the repeating radial gradient, the size of the repeating section is the first color stop subtracted from the angle of the last color stop.

![Comparison of the color stops for repeating and non-repeating conic and radial gradients](repeatingconicgradient.png)

The above gradients are defined as being one third blue, one third red, and one third yellow.

```css
repeating-conic-gradient(from 0deg, red 0deg 30deg, yellow 30deg 60deg, blue 60deg 90deg);

repeating-radial-gradient(red 0 8%, yellow 8% 16%, blue 16% 24%);

conic-gradient(red 120deg, yellow 120deg 240deg, blue 240deg);

radial-gradient(red 33%, yellow 33% 66%, blue 66%);
```

For a repeating gradient to repeat we define the first and last color stops. Like in non-repeating gradients, the first and last color stops are assumed to be 0 and either 100% or 360deg if not explicitly declared. When defaulting to these values, the repeating arc is 360 degrees, and therefore doesn't repeat.

Like the non-repeating conic gradient, the color-stops are placed around a gradient arc — the circumference of a circle, rather than on the gradient line emerging from the center of the gradient. The colors transition as if spun around the center of a circle, starting at the top if no `from <angle>` is declared, and going clockwise for the size of the angle that is the different between the largest and smallest color angle, then repeating.

A repeating conic gradient is specified by indicating a rotation angle, the center of the gradient, and then specifying a list of color-stops. Like non-repeating conic gradients, the color-stops of a repeating conic gradient are specified with an {{cssxref('angle')}}. Units include `deg` for degrees, `grad` for gradients, `rad` for radians, and `turn` for turns. There are 360 degrees, 400 gradians, 2π radians, and 1 turn in a circle. Browsers supporting repeating conic gradients also accept percent values, with 100% equaling 360 degrees, but this is not in the specification.

Radial and conic gradient syntax provides for positioning the center of the gradient anywhere within, or even outside, the image. The values for the position are similar to the syntax for 2-value {{cssxref('background-position')}}.

The gradient arc is part of the circumference of the gradient. 0 degrees is north, or 12:00pm. The colors of the gradient are determined by the angled color stops, their starting points, ending points, and, in between, and optional angled color-stop points. The transitions between colors can be altered with color hints between adjacent colors' color stops.

#### Customizing gradients

By adding more angled color-stop points on the gradient arc, you can create a highly customized transition between multiple colors. A color-stop's position can be explicitly defined by using an {{CSSxRef("&lt;angle&gt;")}}. If you don't specify the location of a color stop, it is placed halfway between the one that precedes it and the one that follows it. Like the non-repeating gradient counterpart, if you don't specify an angle for the first or last color stop, the values will be 0deg and 360deg. If you don't declare an angle for either, you'll get a non-repeating conic gradient. If you declare a non 0 or 360degree for the first or last respectively, the gradient will repeat based on that value. For example, if you don't declare an angle for the first color, and declare 10% on the last color stop, the arc will repeat 10 times. Rather, the starting point is the first color stop declared, and the last color stop is the last color stop angle declared. The following two gradients are equivalent:

```css
repeating-conic-gradient(red, orange, yellow, green, blue 50%);
repeating-conic-gradient(from -45deg, red 45deg, orange, yellow, green, blue 225deg)
```

By default, colors transition smoothly from the color at one color stop to the color at the subsequent color stop, with the midpoint between the colors being the half way point between the color transition. You can move this color transition midpoint to any point between two color stops by adding a color hint, indicating where the middle of the color transition should be.

If two or more color stops are at the same location, the transition will be a hard line between the first and last colors declared at that location.

While you can mix and match different angle units, don't. It makes CSS hard to read.

## Accessibility

Browsers do not provide any special information on background images to assistive technology. This is important primarily for screen readers, as a screen reader will not announce its presence and therefore convey nothing to its users. While it is possible to create pie charts, checkerboards, and other effects with conic gradients, CSS images provide no native way to assign alternative text, and therefore the image represented by the conic gradient will not be accessible to screen reader users. If the image contains information critical to understanding the page's overall purpose, it is better to describe it semantically in the document.

## Examples

### Black and white starburst

```css hidden
div {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
}
```

```html hidden
<div></div>
```

```css
div {
  background-image: repeating-conic-gradient(white 0 9deg, black 9deg 18deg);
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Black_and_white_starburst", 220, 220)}}

### Off-centered gradient

This gradient repeats 18 times, but since we only see the right half, we only see 9 repeats.

```css hidden
div {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
}
```

```html hidden
<div></div>
```

```css
div {
  background: repeating-conic-gradient(
    from 3deg at 25% 25%,
    green,
    blue 2deg 5deg,
    green,
    yellow 15deg 18deg,
    green 20deg
  );
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Off-centered_gradient", 220, 220)}}

### Interpolating with hue

```html hidden
<div class="shorter"></div>
<div class="longer"></div>
```

```css hidden
div {
  display: inline-block;
  margin-top: 1rem;
  width: 45vw;
  height: 80vh;
}

.shorter::before {
  content: "shorter hue";
  display: block;
  margin-top: -1rem;
}

.longer::before {
  content: "longer hue";
  display: block;
  margin-top: -1rem;
}
```

In this example for interpolation, [hsl](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl) color system is being used and [hue](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hue) is being interpolated.

```css
.shorter {
  background-image: repeating-conic-gradient(
    in hsl shorter hue,
    red,
    blue 180deg
  );
}

.longer {
  background-image: repeating-conic-gradient(
    in hsl longer hue,
    red,
    blue 180deg
  );
}
```

The box on the left uses [shorter interpolation](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hue-interpolation-method#shorter), meaning color goes straight from red to blue using the shorter arc on the [color wheel](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Color_wheel). The box on the right uses [longer interpolation](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hue-interpolation-method#longer), meaning the color goes from red to blue using the longer arc, traversing through greens, yellows, and oranges.

The **`repeating-linear-gradient()`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [function](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_and_units/CSS_value_functions) creates an image consisting of repeating linear gradients. It is similar to {{cssxref("gradient/linear-gradient", "linear-gradient()")}} and takes the same arguments, but it repeats the color stops infinitely in all directions so as to cover its entire container. The function's result is an object of the {{cssxref("&lt;gradient&gt;")}} data type, which is a special kind of {{cssxref("&lt;image&gt;")}}.

The length of the gradient that repeats is the distance between the first and last color stop. If the first color does not have a color-stop-length, the color-stop-length defaults to 0. With each repetition, the positions of the color stops are shifted by a multiple of the length of the basic linear gradient. Thus, the position of each ending color stop coincides with a starting color stop; if the color values are different, this will result in a sharp visual transition. This can be altered with repeating the first color again as the last color.

As with any gradient, a repeating linear gradient has [no intrinsic dimensions](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image#description); i.e., it has no natural or preferred size, nor a preferred ratio. Its concrete size will match the size of the element it applies to.

Because `<gradient>`s belong to the `<image>` data type, they can only be used where `<image>`s can be used. For this reason, `repeating-linear-gradient()` won't work on {{Cssxref("background-color")}} and other properties that use the {{cssxref("&lt;color&gt;")}} data type.

## Syntax

```css
/* A repeating gradient tilted 45 degrees,
   starting blue and finishing red, repeating 3 times */
repeating-linear-gradient(45deg, blue, red 33.3%)

/* A repeating gradient going from the bottom right to the top left,
   starting blue and finishing red, repeating every 20px */
repeating-linear-gradient(to left top, blue, red 20px)

/* A gradient going from the bottom to top,
   starting blue, turning green after 40%,
   and finishing red. This gradient doesn't repeat because
   the last color stop defaults to 100% */
repeating-linear-gradient(0deg, blue, green 40%, red)

/* A gradient repeating five times, going from the left to right,
   starting red, turning green, and back to red */
repeating-linear-gradient(to right, red 0%, green 10%, red 20%)

/* Interpolation in rectangular color space */
repeating-linear-gradient(in oklab, blue, red 50px)

/* Interpolation in polar color space */
repeating-linear-gradient(in hsl, blue, red 50px)

/* Interpolation in polar color space
  with longer hue interpolation method */
repeating-linear-gradient(in hsl longer hue, blue, red 50px)
```

### Values

- `<side-or-corner>`
  - : The position of the gradient line's starting point. If specified, it consists of the word `to` and up to two keywords: one indicates the horizontal side (`left` or `right`), and the other the vertical side (`top` or `bottom`). The order of the side keywords does not matter. If unspecified, it defaults to `to bottom`.

    The values `to top`, `to bottom`, `to left`, and `to right` are equivalent to the angles `0deg`, `180deg`, `270deg`, and `90deg` respectively. The other values are translated into an angle.

- {{cssxref("&lt;angle&gt;")}}
  - : The gradient line's angle of direction. A value of `0deg` is equivalent to `to top`; increasing values rotate clockwise from there.
- `<linear-color-stop>`
  - : A color-stop's {{CSSxRef("&lt;color&gt;")}} value, followed by one or two optional stop positions, (each being either a {{CSSxRef("&lt;percentage&gt;")}} or a {{CSSxRef("&lt;length&gt;")}} along the gradient's axis). A percentage of `0%`, or a length of `0`, represents the start of the gradient; the value `100%` is 100% of the image size, meaning the gradient will not repeat.
- `<color-hint>`
  - : The color-hint is an interpolation hint defining how the gradient progresses between adjacent color stops. The length defines at which point between two color stops the gradient color should reach the midpoint of the color transition. If omitted, the midpoint of the color transition is the midpoint between two color stops.

> [!NOTE]
> Rendering of color stops in repeating linear gradients follows the same rules as [color stops in linear gradients](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/linear-gradient#composition_of_a_linear_gradient).

## Formal syntax

{{CSSSyntax}}

## Examples

### Zebra stripes

```css hidden
body {
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

```css
body {
  background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(
    -45deg,
    transparent,
    transparent 20px,
    black 20px,
    black 40px
  );
  /* with multiple color stop lengths */
  background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(
    -45deg,
    transparent 0 20px,
    black 20px 40px
  );
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Zebra_stripes', 120, 120)}}

### Ten repeating horizontal bars

```css hidden
body {
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

```css
body {
  background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(
    to bottom,
    rgb(26 198 204),
    rgb(26 198 204) 7%,
    rgb(100 100 100) 10%
  );
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Ten_repeating_horizontal_bars', 120, 120)}}

Because the last color stop is 10% and the gradient is vertical, each gradient in the repeated gradient is 10% of the height, fitting 10 horizontal bars.

### Interpolation in rectangular color space

```css hidden
body {
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

```css
body {
  background: repeating-linear-gradient(90deg in oklab, blue, red 100px);
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Interpolation in rectangular color space", 120, 120)}}

### Interpolating with hue

```html hidden
<div class="shorter">shorter hue</div>
<div class="longer">longer hue</div>
```

```css hidden
div {
  height: 50vh;
  color: #333300;
  font-weight: bolder;
  padding-left: 1.5rem;
}
```

In this example for interpolation, [hsl](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl) color system is being used and [hue](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hue) is being interpolated.

```css
.shorter {
  background: repeating-linear-gradient(
    90deg in hsl shorter hue,
    red,
    blue 300px
  );
}

.longer {
  background: repeating-linear-gradient(
    90deg in hsl longer hue,
    red,
    blue 300px
  );
}
```

The box on the top uses [shorter interpolation](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hue-interpolation-method#shorter), meaning the color goes from red to blue using the shorter arc on the [color wheel](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Color_wheel). The box on the bottom uses [longer interpolation](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hue-interpolation-method#longer), meaning the color goes from red to blue using the longer arc, traversing through greens, yellows, and oranges.

# repeating-radial-gradient()

The **`repeating-radial-gradient()`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [function](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_and_units/CSS_value_functions) creates an image consisting of repeating gradients that radiate from an origin. It is similar to {{cssxref("gradient/radial-gradient", "radial-gradient()")}} and takes the same arguments, but it repeats the color stops infinitely in all directions so as to cover its entire container, similar to {{cssxref("gradient/repeating-linear-gradient", "repeating-linear-gradient()")}}. The function's result is an object of the {{cssxref("&lt;gradient&gt;")}} data type, which is a special kind of {{cssxref("&lt;image&gt;")}}.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: repeating-radial-gradient()")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
background: repeating-radial-gradient(#e66465, #9198e5 20%);
```

```css interactive-example-choice
background: repeating-radial-gradient(closest-side, #3f87a6, #ebf8e1, #f69d3c);
```

```css interactive-example-choice
background: repeating-radial-gradient(
  circle at 100%,
  #333333,
  #333333 10px,
  #eeeeee 10px,
  #eeeeee 20px
);
```

```html interactive-example
<section class="display-block" id="default-example">
  <div id="example-element"></div>
</section>
```

```css interactive-example
#example-element {
  min-height: 100%;
}
```

With each repetition, the positions of the color stops are shifted by a multiple of the dimensions of the basic radial gradient (the distance between the last color stop and the first). Thus, the position of each ending color stop coincides with a starting color stop; if the color values are different, this will result in a sharp visual transition, which can be mitigated by repeating the first color as the last color.

As with any gradient, a repeating radial gradient has [no intrinsic dimensions](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image#description); i.e., it has no natural or preferred size, nor a preferred ratio. Its concrete size will match the size of the element it applies to.

Because `<gradient>`s belong to the `<image>` data type, they can only be used where `<image>`s can be used. For this reason, `repeating-radial-gradient()` won't work on {{cssxref("background-color")}} and other properties that use the {{cssxref("&lt;color&gt;")}} data type.

## Syntax

```css
/* A gradient at the center of its container,
   starting red, changing to blue, and finishing green,
   with the colors repeating every 30px */
repeating-radial-gradient(circle at center, red 0, blue, green 30px)

/* An elliptical gradient near the top left of its container,
   starting red, changing to green and back again,
   repeating five times between the center and the bottom right corner,
   and only once between the center and the top left corner */
repeating-radial-gradient(farthest-corner at 20% 20%, red 0, green, red 20%)
```

### Values

- {{cssxref("&lt;position&gt;")}}
  - : The position of the gradient, interpreted in the same way as {{cssxref("background-position")}} or {{cssxref("transform-origin")}}. If unspecified, it defaults to `center`.
- `<shape>`
  - : The gradient's shape. The value can be `circle` (meaning that the gradient's shape is a circle with constant radius) or `ellipse` (meaning that the shape is an axis-aligned ellipse). If unspecified, it defaults to `ellipse`.
- `<extent-keyword>`
  - : A keyword describing how big the ending shape must be. The possible values are:

    | Keyword           | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
    | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `closest-side`    | The gradient's ending shape meets the side of the box closest to its center (for circles) or meets both the vertical and horizontal sides closest to the center (for ellipses). |
    | `closest-corner`  | The gradient's ending shape is sized so that it exactly meets the closest corner of the box from its center.                                                                    |
    | `farthest-side`   | Similar to `closest-side`, except the ending shape is sized to meet the side of the box farthest from its center (or vertical and horizontal sides).                            |
    | `farthest-corner` | The gradient's ending shape is sized so that it exactly meets the farthest corner of the box from its center.                                                                   |

    > [!NOTE]
    > Early implementations of this function included other keywords (`cover` and `contain`) as synonyms of the standard `farthest-corner` and `closest-side`, respectively. Use the standard keywords only, as some implementations have already dropped those older variants.

- `<color-stop>`
  - : A color-stop's {{cssxref("&lt;color&gt;")}} value, followed by an optional stop position (either a {{cssxref("&lt;percentage&gt;")}} or a {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}} along the gradient's axis). A percentage of `0%`, or a length of `0`, represents the center of the gradient; the value `100%` represents the intersection of the ending shape with the virtual gradient ray. Percentage values in between are linearly positioned on the virtual gradient ray.

## Examples

### Black and white gradient

```html hidden
<div class="radial-gradient"></div>
```

```css hidden
.radial-gradient {
  width: 120px;
  height: 120px;
}
```

```css
.radial-gradient {
  background: repeating-radial-gradient(
    black,
    black 5px,
    white 5px,
    white 10px
  );
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Black_and_white_gradient', 120, 120)}}

### Farthest-corner

```html hidden
<div class="radial-gradient"></div>
```

```css hidden
.radial-gradient {
  width: 240px;
  height: 120px;
}
```

```css
.radial-gradient {
  background: repeating-radial-gradient(
    ellipse farthest-corner at 20% 20%,
    red,
    black 5%,
    blue 5%,
    green 10%
  );
  background: repeating-radial-gradient(
    ellipse farthest-corner at 20% 20%,
    red 0 5%,
    green 5% 10%
  );
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Farthest-corner', 120, 120)}}

The elliptical gradient will be centered 20% from the top left, and will repeat 10 times between the center and the farthest corner (the bottom right corner). Browsers supporting multi position color stops will display a red and green striped ellipse. Browsers not supporting the syntax yet will see a gradient that goes from red to black and then from blue to green.

### Interpolating with hue

```html hidden
<div class="shorter"></div>
<div class="longer"></div>
```

```css hidden
div {
  display: inline-block;
  margin-top: 1rem;
  width: 45vw;
  height: 80vh;
}

.shorter::before {
  content: "shorter hue";
  display: block;
  margin-top: -1rem;
}

.longer::before {
  content: "longer hue";
  display: block;
  margin-top: -1rem;
}
```

In this example for interpolation, [hsl](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl) color system is being used and [hue](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hue) is being interpolated.

```css
.shorter {
  background-image: repeating-radial-gradient(
    circle at center in hsl shorter hue,
    red 30px,
    blue 60px
  );
}

.longer {
  background-image: repeating-radial-gradient(
    circle at center in hsl longer hue,
    red 30px,
    blue 60px
  );
}
```

The box on the left uses [shorter interpolation](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hue-interpolation-method#shorter), meaning the color goes from red to blue using the shorter arc on [color wheel](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Color_wheel). The box on the right uses [longer interpolation](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hue-interpolation-method#longer), meaning the color goes from red to blue using the longer arc, traversing through greens, yellows, and oranges.

# grid-area

The **`grid-area`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [shorthand property](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Shorthand_properties) specifies a grid item's size and location within a {{glossary("grid", "grid")}} by contributing a line, a span, or nothing (automatic) to its grid placement, thereby specifying the edges of its {{glossary("grid areas", "grid area")}}.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: grid-area")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
grid-area: a;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
grid-area: b;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
grid-area: c;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
grid-area: 2 / 1 / 2 / 4;
```

```html interactive-example
<section class="default-example" id="default-example">
  <div class="example-container">
    <div class="transition-all" id="example-element">Example</div>
  </div>
</section>
```

```css interactive-example
.example-container {
  border: 1px solid #c5c5c5;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: repeat(3, minmax(40px, auto));
  grid-template-areas:
    "a a a"
    "b c c"
    "b c c";
  grid-gap: 10px;
  width: 200px;
}

.example-container > div {
  background-color: rgb(0 0 255 / 0.2);
  border: 3px solid blue;
}

#example-element {
  background-color: rgb(255 0 200 / 0.2);
  border: 3px solid rebeccapurple;
}
```

If four `<grid-line>` values are specified, `grid-row-start` is set to the first value, `grid-column-start` is set to the second value, `grid-row-end` is set to the third value, and `grid-column-end` is set to the fourth value.

When `grid-column-end` is omitted, if `grid-column-start` is a {{cssxref("&lt;custom-ident&gt;")}}, `grid-column-end` is set to that `<custom-ident>`; otherwise, it is set to `auto`.

When `grid-row-end` is omitted, if `grid-row-start` is a `<custom-ident>`, `grid-row-end` is set to that `<custom-ident>`; otherwise, it is set to `auto`.

When `grid-column-start` is omitted, if `grid-row-start` is a `<custom-ident>`, all four longhands are set to that value. Otherwise, it is set to `auto`.

The `grid-area` property can also be set to a {{cssxref("&lt;custom-ident&gt;")}} which acts as a name for the area, which can then be placed using {{cssxref("grid-template-areas")}}.

## Constituent properties

This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:

- [`grid-row-start`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-row-start)
- [`grid-column-start`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-column-start)
- [`grid-row-end`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-row-end)
- [`grid-column-end`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-column-end)

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword values */
grid-area: auto;
grid-area: auto / auto;
grid-area: auto / auto / auto;
grid-area: auto / auto / auto / auto;

/* <custom-ident> values */
grid-area: some-grid-area;
grid-area: some-grid-area / another-grid-area;

/* <integer> && <custom-ident>? values */
grid-area: 4 some-grid-area;
grid-area: 4 some-grid-area / 2 another-grid-area;

/* span && [ <integer> || <custom-ident> ] values */
grid-area: span 3;
grid-area: span 3 / span some-grid-area;
grid-area: 2 span / another-grid-area span;

/* Global values */
grid-area: inherit;
grid-area: initial;
grid-area: revert;
grid-area: revert-layer;
grid-area: unset;
```

### Values

- `auto`
  - : Is a keyword indicating that the property contributes nothing to the grid item's placement, indicating auto-placement or a default span of `1`.
- `<custom-ident>`
  - : If there is a named line with the name `<custom-ident>-start` or `<custom-ident>-end`, it contributes the first such line to the grid item's placement.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Named grid areas automatically generate implicit named lines of this form, so specifying `grid-area: foo;` will choose the start/end edge of that named grid area (unless another line named `foo-start`/`foo-end` was explicitly specified before it).

    Otherwise, this is treated as if the integer `1` had been specified along with the `<custom-ident>`.

- `<integer> && <custom-ident>?`
  - : Contributes the n-th grid line to the grid item's placement. If a negative integer is given, it instead counts in reverse, starting from the end edge of the explicit grid.

    If a name is given as a {{cssxref("&lt;custom-ident&gt;")}}, only lines with that name are counted. If not enough lines with that name exist, all implicit grid lines are assumed to have that name for the purpose of finding this position.

    An {{cssxref("&lt;integer&gt;")}} value of `0` is invalid.

- `span && [ <integer> || <custom-ident> ]`
  - : Contributes a grid span to the grid item's placement such that the corresponding edge of the grid item's grid area is _n_ lines from the opposite edge.

    If a name is given as a {{cssxref("&lt;custom-ident&gt;")}}, only lines with that name are counted. If not enough lines with that name exist, all implicit grid lines on the side of the explicit grid corresponding to the search direction are assumed to have that name for the purpose of counting this span.

    If the {{cssxref("&lt;integer&gt;")}} is omitted, it defaults to `1`. Negative integers or 0 are invalid.

If a grid item is positioned into a column that is not explicitly sized by {{cssxref("grid-template-columns")}}, implicit {{glossary("grid", "grid")}} tracks are created to hold it. This can happen either by explicitly positioning into a column that is out of range, or by the auto-placement algorithm creating additional columns.

```

### Values

- {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}}
  - : Is a non-negative length.
- {{cssxref("&lt;percentage&gt;")}}
  - : Is a non-negative {{cssxref("percentage", "&lt;percentage&gt;")}} value relative to the block size of the grid container. If the block size of the grid container is indefinite, the percentage value is treated like `auto`.
- {{cssxref("&lt;flex&gt;")}}
  - : Is a non-negative dimension with the unit `fr` specifying the track's flex factor. Each `<flex>`-sized track takes a share of the remaining space in proportion to its flex factor.

    When appearing outside a `minmax()` notation, it implies an automatic minimum (i.e., `minmax(auto, <flex>)`).

- {{cssxref("max-content")}}
  - : Is a keyword representing the largest maximal content contribution of the grid items occupying the grid track.
- {{cssxref("min-content")}}
  - : Is a keyword representing the largest minimal content contribution of the grid items occupying the grid track.
- {{cssxref("minmax", "minmax(min, max)")}}
  - : Is a functional notation that defines a size range greater than or equal to _min_ and less than or equal to _max_. If _max_ is smaller than _min_, then _max_ is ignored and the function is treated as _min_. As a maximum, a `<flex>` value sets the track's flex factor. As a minimum, it is treated as zero (or minimal content, if the grid container is sized under a minimal content constraint).
- {{cssxref("fit-content_function", "fit-content( [ &lt;length&gt; | &lt;percentage&gt; ] )")}}
  - : Represents the formula `min(max-content, max(auto, argument))`, which is calculated similar to `auto` (i.e., `minmax(auto, max-content)`), except that the track size is clamped at _argument_ if it is greater than the `auto` minimum.
- `auto`
  - : As a maximum represents the largest {{cssxref("max-content")}} size of the items in that track.

    As a minimum represents the largest minimum size of items in that track (specified by the {{cssxref("min-width")}}/{{cssxref("min-height")}} of the items). This is often, though not always, the {{cssxref("min-content")}} size.

    If used outside of {{cssxref("minmax", "minmax()")}} notation, `auto` represents the range between the minimum and maximum described above. This behaves similarly to `minmax(min-content,max-content)` in most cases.

    > [!NOTE]
    > `auto` track sizes (and only `auto` track sizes) can be stretched by the {{cssxref("align-content")}} and {{cssxref("justify-content")}} properties. Therefore by default, an `auto` sized track will take up any remaining space in the grid container.

# grid-auto-flow

The **`grid-auto-flow`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property controls how the auto-placement algorithm works, specifying exactly how auto-placed items get flowed into the grid.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: grid-auto-flow")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
grid-auto-flow: row;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
grid-auto-flow: column;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
grid-auto-flow: row dense;
```

```html interactive-example
<section class="default-example" id="default-example">
  <div class="example-container">
    <div class="transition-all" id="example-element">
      <div>One</div>
      <div>Two</div>
      <div>Three</div>
      <div>Four</div>
      <div>Five</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

```css interactive-example
#example-element {
  border: 1px solid #c5c5c5;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: repeat(3, minmax(40px, auto));
  grid-gap: 10px;
  width: 220px;
}

#example-element > div {
  background-color: rgb(0 0 255 / 0.2);
  border: 3px solid blue;
}

#example-element > div:nth-child(1) {
  grid-column: auto / span 2;
}

#example-element > div:nth-child(2) {
  grid-column: auto / span 2;
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `masonry-auto-flow` property was dropped from CSS [Masonry layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Masonry_layout) in favor of `grid-auto-flow`.
> See [csswg-drafts #10231](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/10231) for details.

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword values */
grid-auto-flow: row;
grid-auto-flow: column;
grid-auto-flow: dense;
grid-auto-flow: row dense;
grid-auto-flow: column dense;

/* Global values */
grid-auto-flow: inherit;
grid-auto-flow: initial;
grid-auto-flow: revert;
grid-auto-flow: revert-layer;
grid-auto-flow: unset;
```

This property may take one of two forms:

- a single keyword: one of `row`, `column`, or `dense`.
- two keywords: `row dense` or `column dense`.

### Values

- `row`
  - : Items are placed by filling each row in turn, adding new rows as necessary. If neither `row` nor `column` is provided, `row` is assumed.
- `column`
  - : Items are placed by filling each column in turn, adding new columns as necessary.
- `dense`
  - : "dense" packing algorithm attempts to fill in holes earlier in the grid, if smaller items come up later. This may cause items to appear out-of-order, when doing so would fill in holes left by larger items.

    If it is omitted, a "sparse" algorithm is used, where the placement algorithm only ever moves "forward" in the grid when placing items, never backtracking to fill holes. This ensures that all of the auto-placed items appear "in order", even if this leaves holes that could have been filled by later items.

# grid-column-end

The **`grid-column-end`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property specifies a grid item's end position within the grid column by contributing a line, a span, or nothing (automatic) to its grid placement, thereby specifying the block-end edge of its {{glossary("grid areas", "grid area")}}.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: grid-column-end")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
grid-column-end: auto;
```

```css interactive-example-choice

```

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword value */
grid-column-end: auto;

/* <custom-ident> values */
grid-column-end: some-grid-area;

/* <integer> + <custom-ident> values */
grid-column-end: 2;

/* Global values */
grid-column-end: inherit;
grid-column-end: initial;
grid-column-end: revert;
grid-column-end: revert-layer;
grid-column-end: unset;
```

### Values

- `auto`
  - : Contributes nothing to the grid item's placement, indicating auto-placement, an automatic span, or a default span of `1`. This is the default value.
- `<custom-ident>`
  - : Contributes the first line to the grid item's placement if there is a named line with the name `<custom-ident>-end`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Named grid areas automatically generate implicit named lines of this form, so specifying `grid-column-end: foo;` will choose the end edge of that named grid area (unless another line named `foo-end` was explicitly specified before it).

    Otherwise, this is treated as if the integer `1` had been specified along with the `<custom-ident>`.

- `<integer> && <custom-ident>?`
  - : Contributes the nth grid line to the grid item's placement. If a negative integer is given, it instead counts in reverse, starting from the end edge of the explicit grid.

    If a name is given as a \<custom-ident>, only lines with that name are counted. If not enough lines with that name exist, all implicit grid lines are assumed to have that name for the purpose of finding this position.

    An {{cssxref("integer")}} value of `0` is invalid.

- `span && [ <integer> || <custom-ident> ]`
  - : Contributes a grid span to the grid item's placement such that the column end edge of the grid item's grid area is n lines from the start edge.

    If a name is given as a \<custom-ident>, only lines with that name are counted. If not enough lines with that name exist, all implicit grid lines on the side of the explicit grid corresponding to the search direction are assumed to have that name for the purpose of counting this span.

    If the \<integer> is omitted, it defaults to `1`. Negative integers or 0 are invalid.

    The `<custom-ident>` cannot take the `span` and `auto` values.

/* Global values */
grid-column-start: inherit;
grid-column-start: initial;
grid-column-start: revert;
grid-column-start: revert-layer;
grid-column-start: unset;
```

This property is specified as a single `<grid-line>` value. A `<grid-line>` value can be specified as:

- either the `auto` keyword
- or a `<custom-ident>` value
- or an `<integer>` value
- or both `<custom-ident>` and `<integer>`, separated by a space
- or the keyword `span` together with either a `<custom-ident>` or an `<integer>` or both.

### Values

- `auto`
  - : A keyword indicating that the property contributes nothing to the grid item's placement, indicating auto-placement, an automatic span, or a default span of `1`.
- `<custom-ident>`
  - : If there is a named line with the name `<custom-ident>-start`, it contributes the first such line to the grid item's placement.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Named grid areas automatically generate implicit named lines of this form, so specifying `grid-column-start: foo;` will choose the start edge of that named grid area (unless another line named `foo-start` was explicitly specified before it).

    Otherwise, this is treated as if the integer `1` had been specified along with the `<custom-ident>`.

- `<integer> && <custom-ident>?`
  - : Contributes the nth grid line to the grid item's placement. If a negative integer is given, it counts in reverse, starting from the end edge of the explicit grid.

    If a name is given as a `<custom-ident>`, only lines with that name are counted. If not enough lines with that name exist, all implicit grid lines are assumed to have that name for the purpose of finding this position.

    An {{cssxref("integer")}} value of `0` is invalid.

- `span && [ <integer> || <custom-ident> ]`
  - : Contributes a grid span to the grid item's placement, such that the column start edge of the grid item's grid area is n lines from the end edge.

    If a name is given as a `<custom-ident>`, only lines with that name are counted. If not enough lines with that name exist, all implicit grid lines on the side of the explicit grid corresponding to the search direction are assumed to have that name for the purpose of counting this span.

    If the \<integer> is omitted, it defaults to `1`. Negative integers and `0` are invalid.

    The `<custom-ident>` cannot take the `span` and `auto` values.

# grid-column

The **`grid-column`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [shorthand property](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Shorthand_properties) specifies a grid item's size and location within a {{glossary("grid column")}} by contributing a line, a span, or nothing (automatic) to its grid placement, thereby specifying the inline-start and inline-end edge of its {{glossary("grid areas", "grid area")}}.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: grid-column")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
grid-column: 1;
```

```css interactive-example-choice

```

```css interactive-example-choice
grid-column: 2 / -1;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
grid-column: 1 / span 2;
```

```html interactive-example

    <div class="transition-all" id="example-element">One</div>
    <div>Two</div>
    <div>Three</div>
  </div>
</section>
```

```css interactive-example

## Constituent properties

This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:

- [`grid-column-end`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-column-end)
- [`grid-column-start`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-column-start)

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword values */
grid-column: auto;
grid-column: auto / auto;

/* <custom-ident> values */
grid-column: some-grid-area;
grid-column: some-grid-area / some-other-grid-area;

/* <integer> + <custom-ident> values */

grid-column: 5 some-grid-area span;
grid-column: span 3 / 6;
grid-column: span some-grid-area / span some-other-grid-area;
grid-column: 5 some-grid-area span / 2 span;

/* Global values */
grid-column: inherit;
grid-column: initial;
grid-column: revert;
grid-column: revert-layer;
grid-column: unset;
```

This property is specified as one or two `<grid-line>` values.

If two `<grid-line>` values are given, they are separated by `/`.
The `grid-column-start` longhand is set to the value before the slash, and the `grid-column-end` longhand is set to the value after the slash.

Each `<grid-line>` value can be specified as:

- either the `auto` keyword
- or a `<custom-ident>` value
- or an `<integer>` value
- or both `<custom-ident>` and `<integer>`, separated by a space
- or the keyword `span` together with either a `<custom-ident>` or an `<integer>` or both.

### Values

- `auto`
  - : Is a keyword indicating that the property contributes nothing to the grid item's placement, indicating auto-placement, an automatic span, or a default span of `1`.
- `<custom-ident>`
  - : If there is a named line with the name `<custom-ident>-start`/`<custom-ident>-end`, it contributes the first such line to the grid item's placement.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Named grid areas automatically generate implicit named lines of this form, so specifying `grid-column: foo;` will choose the start/end edge of that named grid area (unless another line named `foo-start`/`foo-end` was explicitly specified before it).

    Otherwise, this is treated as if the integer `1` had been specified along with the `<custom-ident>`.

- `<integer> && <custom-ident>?`
  - : Contributes the nth grid line to the grid item's placement. If a negative integer is given, it instead counts in reverse, starting from the end edge of the explicit grid.

    If a name is given as a `<custom-ident>`, only lines with that name are counted. If not enough lines with that name exist, all implicit grid lines are assumed to have that name for the purpose of finding this position.

    An {{cssxref("integer")}} value of `0` is invalid.

- `span && [ <integer> || <custom-ident> ]`
  - : Contributes a grid span to the grid item's placement such that the corresponding edge of the grid item's grid area is n lines from the opposite edge.

    If a name is given as a `<custom-ident>`, only lines with that name are counted. If not enough lines with that name exist, all implicit grid lines on the side of the explicit grid corresponding to the search direction are assumed to have that name for the purpose of counting this span.

    If the `<integer>` is omitted, it defaults to `1`. Negative integers or 0 are invalid.

# grid-row-end

The **`grid-row-end`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property specifies a grid item's end position within the grid row by contributing a line, a span, or nothing (automatic) to its grid placement, thereby specifying the inline-end edge of its {{glossary("grid areas", "grid area")}}.

    The `<custom-ident>` cannot take the `span` and `auto` values.

- `<integer> && <custom-ident>?`
  - : Contributes the nth grid line to the grid item's placement. If a negative integer is given, it instead counts in reverse, starting from the end edge of the explicit grid.

    If a name is given as a \<custom-ident>, only lines with that name are counted. If not enough lines with that name exist, all implicit grid lines are assumed to have that name for the purpose of finding this position.

    An {{cssxref("integer")}} value of `0` is invalid.

- `span && [ <integer> || <custom-ident> ]`
  - : Contributes a grid span to the grid item's placement such that the row end edge of the grid item's grid area is n lines from the start edge.

    If a name is given as a \<custom-ident>, only lines with that name are counted. If not enough lines with that name exist, all implicit grid lines on the side of the explicit grid corresponding to the search direction are assumed to have that name for the purpose of counting this span.

    If the \<integer> is omitted, it defaults to `1`. Negative integers or 0 are invalid.

If two `<grid-line>` values are given, they are separated by `/`. The `grid-row-start` longhand is set to the value before the slash, and the `grid-row-end` longhand is set to the value after the slash.

Each `<grid-line>` value can be specified as:

- either the `auto` keyword
- or a `<custom-ident>` value
- or an `<integer>` value
- or both `<custom-ident>` and `<integer>`, separated by a space
- or the keyword `span` together with either a `<custom-ident>` or an `<integer>` or both.

### Values

- `auto`
  - : Is a keyword indicating that the property contributes nothing to the grid item's placement, indicating auto-placement, an automatic span, or a default span of `1`.
- `<custom-ident>`
  - : If there is a named line with the name `<custom-ident>-start`/`<custom-ident>-end`, it contributes the first such line to the grid item's placement.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Named grid areas automatically generate implicit named lines of this form, so specifying `grid-row: foo;` will choose the start/end edge of that named grid area (unless another line named `foo-start`/`foo-end` was explicitly specified before it).

    Otherwise, this is treated as if the integer `1` had been specified along with the `<custom-ident>`.

- `<integer> && <custom-ident>?`
  - : Contributes the nth grid line to the grid item's placement. If a negative integer is given, it instead counts in reverse, starting from the end edge of the explicit grid.

    If a name is given as a `<custom-ident>`, only lines with that name are counted. If not enough lines with that name exist, all implicit grid lines are assumed to have that name for the purpose of finding this position.

    An {{cssxref("integer")}} value of `0` is invalid.

- `span && [ <integer> || <custom-ident> ]`
  - : Contributes a grid span to the grid item's placement such that the corresponding edge of the grid item's grid area is n lines from the opposite edge.

    If a name is given as a `<custom-ident>`, only lines with that name are counted. If not enough lines with that name exist, all implicit grid lines on the side of the explicit grid corresponding to the search direction are assumed to have that name for the purpose of counting this span.

    If the `<integer>` is omitted, it defaults to `1`. Negative integers or 0 are invalid.

# grid-template-areas

The **`grid-template-areas`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property specifies named {{glossary("grid areas")}}, establishing the cells in the grid and assigning them names.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: grid-template-areas")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
grid-template-areas:
  "a a a"
  "b c c"
  "b c c";
```

```css interactive-example-choice
grid-template-areas:
  "b b a"
  "b b c"
  "b b c";
```

```css interactive-example-choice
grid-template-areas:
  "a a ."
  "a a ."
  ". b c";
```

```html interactive-example
<section class="default-example" id="default-example">
  <div class="example-container">
    <div class="transition-all" id="example-element">
      <div>One (a)</div>
      <div>Two (b)</div>
      <div>Three (c)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

```css interactive-example
#example-element {
  border: 1px solid #c5c5c5;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: repeat(3, minmax(40px, auto));
  grid-gap: 10px;
  width: 200px;
}

#example-element :nth-child(1) {
  background-color: rgb(0 0 255 / 0.2);
  border: 3px solid blue;
  grid-area: a;
}

#example-element :nth-child(2) {
  background-color: rgb(255 0 200 / 0.2);
  border: 3px solid rebeccapurple;
  grid-area: b;
}

#example-element :nth-child(3) {
  background-color: rgb(94 255 0 / 0.2);
  border: 3px solid green;
  grid-area: c;
}
```

Those areas are not associated with any particular grid item, but can be referenced from the grid-placement properties {{cssxref("grid-row-start")}}, {{cssxref("grid-row-end")}}, {{cssxref("grid-column-start")}}, {{cssxref("grid-column-end")}}, and their shorthands {{cssxref("grid-row")}}, {{cssxref("grid-column")}}, and {{cssxref("grid-area")}}.

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword value */
grid-template-areas: none;

/* <string> values */
grid-template-areas: "a b";
grid-template-areas:
  "a b ."
  "a c d";

/* Global values */
grid-template-areas: inherit;
grid-template-areas: initial;
grid-template-areas: revert;
grid-template-areas: revert-layer;
grid-template-areas: unset;
```

### Values

- `none`
  - : The grid container doesn't define any named grid areas.
- {{cssxref("&lt;string&gt;")}}
  - : A row is created for every separate string listed, and a column is created for each cell in the string. Multiple cell tokens with the same name within and between rows create a single named grid area that spans the corresponding grid cells. Unless those cells form a rectangle, the declaration is invalid.

    All the remaining unnamed areas in a grid can be referred using _null cell tokens_. A null cell token is a sequence of one or more `.` (U+002E FULL STOP) characters, e.g., `.`, `...`, or `.....` etc. A null cell token can be used to create empty spaces in the grid.

### Specifying named grid areas

#### HTML

```html
<div id="page">
  <header>Header</header>
  <nav>Navigation</nav>
  <main>Main area</main>
  <footer>Footer</footer>
</div>
```

#### CSS

```css
#page {
  display: grid;
  width: 100%;
  height: 250px;
  grid-template-areas:
    "head head"
    "nav  main"
    ".  foot";
  grid-template-rows: 50px 1fr 30px;
  grid-template-columns: 150px 1fr;
}

#page > header {
  grid-area: head;
  background-color: #8ca0ff;
}

#page > nav {
  grid-area: nav;
  background-color: #ffa08c;
}

#page > main {
  grid-area: main;
  background-color: #ffff64;
}

#page > footer {
  grid-area: foot;
  background-color: #8cffa0;
}
```

In the above code, a null token (`.`) was used to create an unnamed area in the grid container, which we used to create an empty space at the bottom left corner of the grid.

grid-template-columns: inherit;
grid-template-columns: initial;
grid-template-columns: revert;
grid-template-columns: revert-layer;
grid-template-columns: unset;
```

### Values

- `none`
  - : Indicates that there is no explicit grid. Any columns will be implicitly generated and their size will be determined by the {{cssxref("grid-auto-columns")}} property.
- `[line-name]`
  - : A [`<custom-ident>`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/custom-ident) specifying a name for the line in that location. The ident may be any valid string other than the reserved words `span` and `auto`. Lines may have multiple names separated by a space inside the square brackets, for example `[line-name-a line-name-b]`.
- {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}}
  - : A non-negative length, giving the width of the column.
- {{cssxref("&lt;percentage&gt;")}}
  - : A non-negative {{cssxref("percentage", "&lt;percentage&gt;")}} value relative to the inline size of the grid container. If the size of the grid container depends on the size of its tracks, the browser treats the percentage as `auto`.
    The browser may adjust the intrinsic size contributions of the track to the size of the grid container and may increase the final size of the track by the minimum amount that would result in honoring the percentage.
- {{cssxref("&lt;flex&gt;")}}
  - : Is a non-negative dimension with the unit `fr` specifying the track's flex factor. Each `<flex>`-sized track takes a share of the remaining space in proportion to its flex factor.

    When appearing outside a `minmax()` notation, it implies an automatic minimum (i.e., `minmax(auto, <flex>)`).

- {{cssxref("max-content")}}
  - : Is a keyword representing the largest [maximal content contribution](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-sizing-3/#max-content) of the grid items occupying the grid track. For example, if the first element of the grid track contains the sentence _"Repetitio est mater studiorum"_ and the second element contains the sentence _"Dum spiro, spero"_, maximal content contribution will be defined by the size of the largest sentence among all of the grid elements - _"Repetitio est mater studiorum"_.
- {{cssxref("min-content")}}
  - : Is a keyword representing the largest [minimal content contribution](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-sizing-3/#min-content) of the grid items occupying the grid track. For example, if the first element of the grid track contains the sentence _"Repetitio est mater studiorum"_ and the second element contains the sentence _"Dum spiro, spero"_, minimal content contribution will be defined by the size of the largest word among all of the sentences in the grid elements - _"studiorum"_.
- {{cssxref("minmax", "minmax(min, max)")}}
  - : Is a functional notation that defines a size range greater than or equal to _min_ and less than or equal to _max_. If _max_ is smaller than _min_, then _max_ is ignored and the function is treated as _min_. As a maximum, a `<flex>` value sets the track's flex factor. It is invalid as a minimum.
- `auto`
  - : As a maximum value, it represents the largest {{cssxref("max-content")}} size of the items in that track.

    As a minimum value, it represents the largest minimum size of items in that track (specified by the {{cssxref("min-width")}}/{{cssxref("min-height")}} properties of the items). This often corresponds to the {{cssxref("min-content")}} size, but not always.

    If used outside of {{cssxref("minmax", "minmax()")}} notation, `auto` represents the range between the minimum and maximum values described above. In most cases, this behaves similarly to `minmax(min-content,max-content)`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > `auto` track sizes (and only `auto` track sizes) can be stretched by the {{cssxref("align-content")}} and {{cssxref("justify-content")}} properties. Therefore, by default, an `auto`-sized track will take up any remaining space in the grid container.

- {{cssxref("fit-content_function", "fit-content( [ &lt;length&gt; | &lt;percentage&gt; ] )")}}
  - : Represents the formula `max(minimum, min(limit, max-content))`, where _minimum_ represents an `auto` minimum (which is often, but not always, equal to a {{cssxref("min-content")}} minimum), and _limit_ is the track sizing function passed as an argument to fit-content(). This is essentially calculated as the smaller of `minmax(auto, max-content)` and `minmax(auto, limit)`.
- {{cssxref("repeat", "repeat( [ &lt;positive-integer&gt; | auto-fill | auto-fit ] , &lt;track-list&gt; )")}}
  - : Represents a repeated fragment of the track list, allowing a large number of columns that exhibit a recurring pattern to be written in a more compact form.
- [`masonry`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Masonry_layout)
  - : The masonry value indicates that this axis should be laid out according to the masonry algorithm.
- [`subgrid`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Subgrid)
  - : The `subgrid` value indicates that the grid will adopt the spanned portion of its parent grid in that axis. Rather than being specified explicitly, the sizes of the grid rows/columns will be taken from the parent grid's definition.

```

This property may be specified as:

- either the keyword value `none`
- or a `<track-list>` value
- or an `<auto-track-list>` value.

### Values

- `none`
  - : A keyword meaning that there is no explicit grid. Any rows will be implicitly generated and their size will be determined by the {{cssxref("grid-auto-rows")}} property.
- `[line-name]`
  - : A [`<custom-ident>`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/custom-ident) specifying a name for the line in that location. The ident may be any valid string other than the reserved words `span` and `auto`. Lines may have multiple names separated by a space inside the square brackets, for example `[line-name-a line-name-b]`.
- {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}}
  - : A non-negative length.
- {{cssxref("&lt;percentage&gt;")}}
  - : A non-negative {{cssxref("percentage", "&lt;percentage&gt;")}} value, relative to the block size of the grid container. If the size of the grid container depends on the size of its tracks, the browser treats the percentage as `auto` for the purpose of calculating the intrinsic size of the grid container. The percentage is then resolved against the resulting grid container size for laying out the grid and its items. The browser may adjust the intrinsic size contributions of the track to the size of the grid container and may increase the final size of the track by the minimum amount that would result in honoring the percentage.
- {{cssxref("&lt;flex_value&gt;","&lt;flex&gt;")}}
  - : A non-negative dimension with the unit `fr` specifying the track's flex factor. Each `<flex>`-sized track takes a share of the remaining space in proportion to its flex factor. When appearing outside a `minmax()` notation, it implies an automatic minimum (i.e., `minmax(auto, <flex>)`).
- {{cssxref("max-content")}}
  - : A keyword representing the largest maximal content contribution of the grid items occupying the grid track.
- {{cssxref("min-content")}}
  - : A keyword representing the largest minimal content contribution of the grid items occupying the grid track.
- {{cssxref("minmax", "minmax(min, max)")}}
  - : A functional notation that defines a size range, greater than or equal to _min_, and less than or equal to _max_. If _max_ is smaller than _min_, then _max_ is ignored and the function is treated as _min_. As a maximum, a `<flex>` value sets the track's flex factor. It is invalid as a minimum.
- `auto`
  - : As a maximum value, it represents the largest {{cssxref("max-content")}} size of the items in that track.

    As a minimum value, it represents the largest minimum size of items in that track (specified by the {{cssxref("min-width")}}/{{cssxref("min-height")}} properties of the items). This often corresponds to the {{cssxref("min-content")}} size, but not always.

    If used outside of {{cssxref("minmax", "minmax()")}} notation, `auto` represents the range between the minimum and maximum values described above. In most cases, this behaves similarly to `minmax(min-content,max-content)`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > `auto` track sizes (and only `auto` track sizes) can be stretched by the {{cssxref("align-content")}} and {{cssxref("justify-content")}} properties. Therefore, by default, an `auto`-sized track will take up any remaining space in the grid container.

- {{cssxref("fit-content_function", "fit-content( [ &lt;length&gt; | &lt;percentage&gt; ] )")}}
  - : Represents the formula `min(max-content, max(auto, argument))`, which is calculated similar to `auto` (i.e., `minmax(auto, max-content)`), except that the track size is clamped at _argument_ if it is greater than the `auto` minimum.
- {{cssxref("repeat", "repeat( [ &lt;positive-integer&gt; | auto-fill | auto-fit ] , &lt;track-list&gt; )")}}
  - : Represents a repeated fragment of the track list, allowing a large number of rows that exhibit a recurring pattern to be written in a more compact form.
- [`masonry`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Masonry_layout)
  - : Indicates that this axis should be laid out according to the masonry algorithm.
- [`subgrid`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Subgrid)

## Constituent properties

This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:

- [`grid-template-areas`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-areas)
- [`grid-template-columns`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-columns)
- [`grid-template-rows`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-rows)

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword value */
grid-template: none;

/* grid-template-rows / grid-template-columns values */
grid-template: 100px 1fr / 50px 1fr;
grid-template: auto 1fr / auto 1fr auto;
grid-template: [line-name] 100px / [column-name1] 30% [column-name2] 70%;
grid-template: fit-content(100px) / fit-content(40%);

/* grid-template-areas grid-template-rows / grid-template-column values */
grid-template:
  "a a a"
  "b b b";
grid-template:
  "a a a" 20%
  "b b b" auto;
grid-template:
  [header-top] "a a a" [header-bottom]
  [main-top] "b b b" 1fr [main-bottom]
  / auto 1fr auto;

/* Global values */
grid-template: inherit;
grid-template: initial;
grid-template: revert;
grid-template: revert-layer;
grid-template: unset;
```

### Values

- `none`
  - : Sets all three longhand properties to `none`, meaning there is no explicit grid. There are no named grid areas. Rows and columns will be implicitly generated; their size will be determined by the {{cssxref("grid-auto-rows")}} and {{cssxref("grid-auto-columns")}} properties. This is the default value.
- `<'grid-template-rows'> / <'grid-template-columns'>`
  - : Sets {{cssxref("grid-template-rows")}} and {{cssxref("grid-template-columns")}} to the specified values, and sets {{cssxref("grid-template-areas")}} to `none`.
- `[ <line-names>? <string> <track-size>? <line-names>? ]+ [ / <explicit-track-list> ]?`
  - : Sets {{cssxref("grid-template-areas")}} to the strings listed, {{cssxref("grid-template-rows")}} to the track sizes following each string (filling in `auto` for any missing sizes), and splicing in the named lines defined before/after each size, and {{cssxref("grid-template-columns")}} to the track listing specified after the slash (or `none`, if not specified).

    > [!NOTE]
    > The {{cssxref("repeat", "repeat()")}} function isn't allowed in these track listings, as the tracks are intended to visually line up one-to-one with the rows/columns in the "ASCII art".

> [!NOTE]
> The {{cssxref("grid")}} shorthand accepts the same syntax, but also resets the implicit grid properties to their initial values. Use `grid` (as opposed to `grid-template`) to prevent these values from cascading in separately.

# grid

The **`grid`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property is a [shorthand property](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Shorthand_properties) that sets all of the explicit and implicit grid properties in a single declaration.

Using `grid` you specify one axis using {{cssxref("grid-template-rows")}} or {{cssxref("grid-template-columns")}}, you then specify how content should auto-repeat in the other axis using the implicit grid properties: {{cssxref("grid-auto-rows")}}, {{cssxref("grid-auto-columns")}}, and {{cssxref("grid-auto-flow")}}.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: grid")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
grid: auto-flow / 1fr 1fr 1fr;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
grid: auto-flow dense / 40px 40px 1fr;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
grid: repeat(3, 80px) / auto-flow;
```

# CSS guides

There are a number of methods that you can use to lay out your web pages and applications. MDN contains a number of in-depth guides to the different methods, and this page provides an overview of them all.

## Normal flow, block, and inline layout

If you are not using a flex or grid layout, then your content is laid out using normal flow, or block and inline layout. These guides will help you to understand the way this layout method works.

  - : Absolute positioning, flexbox, and grid all result in the stack (elements' relative position on the z-axis) to be manipulable via the `z-index` property. This article explains how to manage it.

## Multi-column layout

Multi-column layout, often referred to as multicol, takes content in normal flow, and breaks it into columns. Find out how to use this layout method in the following guides.

  - : Dealing with content breaks as the content is split into columns.

## Flexbox

CSS Flexible Box Layout, commonly known as flexbox, is a layout model optimized for user interface design, and the layout of items in one dimension. In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can "flex" their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent.

# height

The **`height`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property specifies the height of an element. By default, the property defines the height of the [content area](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_box_model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model#content_area). If {{cssxref("box-sizing")}} is set to `border-box`, however, it instead determines the height of the [border area](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_box_model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model#border_area).

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: height")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
height: 150px;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
height: 6em;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
height: 75%;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
height: auto;
```

```html interactive-example
<section class="default-example" id="default-example">
  <div class="transition-all" id="example-element">
    This is a box where you can change the height.
  </div>
</section>
```

```css interactive-example
#example-element {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  background-color: #5b6dcd;
  justify-content: center;
  color: white;
}
```

The {{cssxref("min-height")}} and {{cssxref("max-height")}} properties override `height`.

> [!NOTE]
> As a geometric property, `height` also applies to the {{SVGElement("svg")}}, {{SVGElement("rect")}}, {{SVGElement("image")}}, and {{SVGElement("foreignObject")}} SVG elements, with `auto` resolving to `0` and percent values being relative to the SVG viewport height for `<rect>`. The CSS `height` property value overrides any SVG {{SVGAttr("height")}} attribute value set on the SVG element.

## Syntax

```css
/* <length> values */
height: 120px;
height: 10em;
height: 100vh;
height: anchor-size(height);
height: anchor-size(--my-anchor self-block, 250px);
height: clamp(200px, anchor-size(width));

/* <percentage> value */
height: 75%;

/* Keyword values */
height: max-content;
height: min-content;
height: fit-content;
height: fit-content(20em);
height: auto;
height: stretch;

/* Global values */
height: inherit;
height: initial;
height: revert;
height: revert-layer;
height: unset;
```

### Values

- {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}}
  - : Defines the height as a distance value.
- {{cssxref("&lt;percentage&gt;")}}
  - : Defines the height as a percentage of the [containing block](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Containing_block)'s height.
- `auto`
  - : The browser will calculate and select a height for the specified element.
- {{cssxref("max-content")}}
  - : The intrinsic preferred height.
- {{cssxref("min-content")}}
  - : The intrinsic minimum height.
- {{cssxref("fit-content")}}
  - : Use the available space, but not more than [max-content](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max-content), i.e., `min(max-content, max(min-content, stretch))`.
- [`fit-content(<length-percentage>)`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/fit-content_function)
  - : Uses the fit-content formula with the available space replaced by the specified argument, i.e., `min(max-content, max(min-content, <length-percentage>))`.
- `stretch`
  - : Sets the height of the element's [margin box](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Box_model#parts_of_a_box) to the height of its [containing block](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Containing_block#identifying_the_containing_block). It attempts to make the margin box fill the available space in the containing block, so in a way behaving similar to `100%` but applying the resulting size to the margin box rather than the box determined by [box-sizing](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing).

## Accessibility

Ensure that elements set with a `height` aren't truncated and/or don't obscure other content when the page is zoomed to increase text size.

# <hex-color>

The **`<hex-color>`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [data type](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_and_units/CSS_data_types) is a notation for describing the _hexadecimal color syntax_ of an [sRGB](/en-US/docs/Glossary/RGB) color using its primary color components (red, green, blue) written as hexadecimal numbers, as well as its transparency.

A `<hex-color>` value can be used everywhere where a [`<color>`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) can be used.

## Syntax

```plain
#RGB        // The three-value syntax
#RGBA       // The four-value syntax
#RRGGBB     // The six-value syntax
#RRGGBBAA   // The eight-value syntax
```

### Value

- `R` or `RR`
  - : The _red_ component of the color, as a case-insensitive hexadecimal number between `0` and `ff` (255). If there is only one number, it is duplicated: `1` means `11`.
- `G` or `GG`
  - : The _green_ component of the color, as a case-insensitive hexadecimal number between `0` and `ff` (255). If there is only one number, it is duplicated: `c` means `cc`.
- `B` or `BB`
  - : The _blue_ component of the color, as a case-insensitive hexadecimal number between `0` and `ff` (255). If there is only one number, it is duplicated: `9` means `99`.
- `A` or `AA` {{optional_inline}}
  - : The _alpha_ component of the color, indicating its transparency, as a case-insensitive hexadecimal number between `0` and `ff` (255). If there is only one number, it is duplicated: `e` means `ee`. `0`, or `00`, represents a fully transparent color, and `f`, or `ff`, a fully opaque one.

> [!NOTE]
> The syntax is case-insensitive: `#00ff00` is the same as `#00FF00`.

## Examples

### Hexadecimal hot pink

This example includes four hot pink squares, with fully opaque or semi-transparent backgrounds created using four different-length case-insensitive hex-color syntaxes.

#### HTML

```html
<div>
  #F09
  <div class="c1"></div>
</div>
<div>
  #f09a
  <div class="c2"></div>
</div>
<div>
  #ff0099
  <div class="c3"></div>
</div>
<div>
  #FF0099AA
  <div class="c4"></div>
</div>
```

#### CSS

The hot pink background colors are created using the three-, four-, six-, and eight-value hex notations, using both uppercase and lowercase letters.

```css hidden
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-evenly;
  font-family: monospace;
}
div {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

```css
[class] {
  width: 40px;

}
.c1 {
  background: #f09;

# <hue-interpolation-method>

The **`<hue-interpolation-method>`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [data type](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_and_units/CSS_data_types) represents the algorithm used for interpolation between {{CSSXref("&lt;hue&gt;")}} values.
The interpolation method specifies how to find a midpoint between two hue values based on a color wheel.
It is used as a component of the {{CSSXref("&lt;color-interpolation-method&gt;")}} data type.

When interpolating `<hue>` values, the hue interpolation algorithm defaults to [`shorter`](#shorter).

## Syntax

A `<hue-interpolation-method>` value consists of the name of a hue interpolation algorithm followed by a literal token `hue`:

```plain
shorter hue
longer hue
increasing hue
decreasing hue
```

### Values

Any pair of hue angles correspond to two radii on the {{Glossary("color wheel")}}, which cut the circumference into two possible arcs for interpolation. Both arcs start at the first radius and end at the second radius, but one goes clockwise and the other goes counterclockwise.

> [!NOTE]
> The following descriptions and illustrations are based on color wheels in which hue angles increase in a clockwise direction. Be aware that there are color wheels where an increase in angles will be a counterclockwise operation.

For a pair of hue angles `θ1` and `θ2` normalized to the range `[0deg, 360deg)`, there are four algorithms to determine which arc is used when interpolating from `θ1` to `θ2`:

- `shorter`
  - : Use the shorter arc. When the two radii coincide, the arc degenerates to a single point. When both arcs have the same lengths:
    - If `θ1 < θ2`, use the clockwise arc;
    - If `θ1 > θ2`, use the counterclockwise arc.

    | `θ1 = 45deg`, `θ2 = 135deg`                                        | `θ1 = 135deg`, `θ2 = 45deg`                                        |
    | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | ![shorter with θ1 = 45deg and θ2 = 135deg](shorter_increasing.png) | ![shorter with θ1 = 135deg and θ2 = 45deg](shorter_decreasing.png) |

- `longer`
  - : Use the longer arc. When the two radii coincide:
    - If `θ1 ≤ θ2`, the arc becomes the full circumference with a clockwise orientation.
    - If `θ1 > θ2`, the arc becomes the full circumference with a counterclockwise orientation.

    When both arcs have the same lengths:
    - If `θ1 < θ2`, use the clockwise arc;
    - If `θ1 > θ2`, use the counterclockwise arc.

    | `θ1 = 45deg`, `θ2 = 135deg`                                      | `θ1 = 135deg`, `θ2 = 45deg`                                      |
    | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | ![longer with θ1 = 45deg and θ2 = 135deg](longer_decreasing.png) | ![longer with θ1 = 135deg and θ2 = 45deg](longer_increasing.png) |

- `increasing`
  - : Use the clockwise arc. When the two radii coincide, the arc degenerates to a single point.

    | `θ1 = 45deg`, `θ2 = 135deg`                                           | `θ1 = 135deg`, `θ2 = 45deg`                                          |
    | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | ![increasing with θ1 = 45deg and θ2 = 135deg](shorter_increasing.png) | ![increasing with θ1 = 135deg and θ2 = 45deg](longer_increasing.png) |

- `decreasing`
  - : Use the counterclockwise arc. When the two radii coincide, the arc degenerates to a single point.

    | `θ1 = 45deg`, `θ2 = 135deg`                                          | `θ1 = 135deg`, `θ2 = 45deg`                                           |
    | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | ![decreasing with θ1 = 45deg and θ2 = 135deg](longer_decreasing.png) | ![decreasing with θ1 = 135deg and θ2 = 45deg](shorter_decreasing.png) |

As there are only two arcs to choose from, these algorithms are pairwise equivalent under certain circumstances. Specifically:

- If `0deg < θ2 - θ1 < 180deg` or `θ2 - θ1 < -180deg`, `shorter` and `increasing` are equivalent, whereas `longer` and `decreasing` are equivalent.
- If `-180deg < θ2 - θ1 < 0deg` or `θ2 - θ1 > 180deg`, `shorter` and `decreasing` are equivalent, whereas `longer` and `increasing` are equivalent.

A notable feature of `increasing` and `decreasing` is that when the hue angle difference passes through `180deg` during transition or animation, the arc will not flip to the other side like `shorter` and `longer` do.

# <hue>

The **`<hue>`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [data type](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_and_units/CSS_data_types) represents the hue angle of a color.
It is used in the color functions that accept hue expressed as a single value, specifically [`hsl()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl), [`hwb()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hwb), [`lch()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/lch), and [`oklch()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/oklch) functional notations.

## Syntax

A `<hue>` can be either an `<angle>` or a `<number>`.

### Values

- {{CSSXref("&lt;angle&gt;")}}
  - : An angle expressed in degrees, gradians, radians, or turns using the `deg`, `grad`, `rad`, or `turn`, respectively.
- `<number>`
  - : A real number, representing degrees of the hue angle.

As an `<angle>` is periodic, `<hue>` is normalized to the range `[0deg, 360deg)`. It implicitly wraps around such that `480deg` is the same as `120deg`, `-120deg` is the same as `240deg`, `-1turn` is the same as `1turn`, and so on.

## Description

![An sRGB color wheel](color_wheel.svg)

The color wheel above shows hues at all angles in the [sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB) {{glossary("color space")}}. In particular, _red_ is at `0deg`, _yellow_ is at `60deg`, _lime_ is at `120deg`, _cyan_ is at `180deg`, _blue_ is at `240deg`, and _magenta_ is at `300deg`.

The angles corresponding to particular hues differ depending on the color space. For example, the hue angle of sRGB green is `120deg` in the sRGB color space, but `134.39deg` in the CIELAB color space.

The following table lists typical colors at various angles in the sRGB (used by {{CSSXref("color_value/hsl", "hsl()")}} and {{CSSXref("color_value/hwb", "hwb()")}}), CIELAB (used by {{CSSXref("color_value/lch", "lch()")}}), and Oklab (used by {{CSSXref("color_value/oklch", "oklch()")}}) color spaces:

## Interpolation of `<hue>` values

`<hue>` values are interpolated as {{CSSXref("&lt;angle&gt;")}} values, and the default interpolation algorithm is [`shorter`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hue-interpolation-method#values). In some color-related CSS functions, this can be overridden by the {{CSSXref("&lt;hue-interpolation-method&gt;")}} component.

### Changing the hue of a color using a slider

The following example shows the effect of changing the `hue` value of the [`hsl()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl) functional notation on a color.

#### HTML

```html
<input type="range" min="0" max="360" value="0" id="hue-slider" />
<p>Hue: <span id="hue-value">0deg</span></p>
<div id="box"></div>
```

#### CSS

```css hidden
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  margin: 10px;
  border: 1px solid black;
}
p {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
span {
  font-family: monospace;
  background: rgb(0 0 0 / 10%);
  padding: 3px;
}
#hue-slider {
  width: 90%;
}
```

```css
#box {
  background-color: hsl(0 100% 50%);
}
```

#### JavaScript

```js
const hue = document.querySelector("#hue-slider");
const box = document.querySelector("#box");
hue.addEventListener("input", () => {
  box.style.backgroundColor = `hsl(${hue.value} 100% 50%)`;
  document.querySelector("#hue-value").textContent = `${hue.value}deg`;

### Approximating red hues in different color spaces

The following example shows a similar red color in different color spaces.
The values in the `lch()` and `oklch()` functions are rounded for readability.

#### HTML

```html
<div data-color="hsl-red">hsl()</div>
<div data-color="hwb-red">hwb()</div>
<div data-color="lch-red">lch()</div>
<div data-color="oklch-red">oklch()</div>
```

#### CSS

```css
[data-color="hsl-red"] {
  /* hsl(<hue> <saturation> <lightness>) */
  background-color: hsl(0 100% 50%);
}
[data-color="hwb-red"] {
  /* hwb(<hue> <whiteness> <blackness>) */
  background-color: hwb(0 0% 0%);

[data-color="lch-red"] {
  /* lch(<lightness> <chroma> <hue>) */
  background-color: lch(50 150 40);
}
[data-color="oklch-red"] {
  /* oklch(<lightness> <chroma> <hue>) */
  background-color: oklch(0.6 0.4 20);

# hyphenate-character

The **`hyphenate-character`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets the character (or string) used at the end of a line before a hyphenation break.

Both automatic and soft hyphens are displayed according to the specified hyphenate-character value.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: hyphenate-character")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
hyphenate-character: auto;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
hyphenate-character: "=";
```

```css interactive-example-choice
hyphenate-character: "—";
```

```html interactive-example
<section id="default-example">
  <p id="example-element">An extra­ordinarily long English word!</p>
</section>
```

```css interactive-example
#example-element {
  border: 2px dashed #999999;
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  text-align: left;
  width: 7rem;
  hyphens: auto;
}
```

## Syntax

```css
hyphenate-character: <string>;
hyphenate-character: auto;
```

The value either sets the string to use instead of a hyphen, or indicates that the user agent should select an appropriate string based on the current typographic conventions (default).

### Values

- `<string>`
  - : The {{cssxref("&lt;string&gt;")}} to use at the end of the line before a hyphenation break.
    The user agent may truncate this value if too many characters are used.
- `auto`
  - : The user-agent selects an appropriate string based on the content language's typographic conventions.
    This is the default property value, and only needs to be explicitly set in order to override a different inherited value.

## Formal definition

{{CSSInfo}}

## Formal syntax

{{csssyntax}}

## Examples

This example shows two identical blocks of text that have {{cssxref("hyphens")}} set to ensure that they break wherever needed, and on soft hyphen breaks (created using `&shy;`).
The first block has the value of the hyphen changed to the equals symbol (`=`).
The second block has no hyphenate-character set, which is equivalent to `hyphenate-character: auto` for user agents that support this property.

### HTML

```html
<dl>
  <dt><code>hyphenate-character: "="</code></dt>
  <dd id="string" lang="en">Superc&shy;alifragilisticexpialidocious</dd>
  <dt><code>hyphenate-character is not set</code></dt>
  <dd lang="en">Superc&shy;alifragilisticexpialidocious</dd>
</dl>
```

### CSS

```css
dd {
  width: 90px;
  border: 1px solid black;
  hyphens: auto;
}

dd#string {
  -webkit-hyphenate-character: "=";
  hyphenate-character: "=";

# hyphenate-limit-chars

The **`hyphenate-limit-chars`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property specifies the minimum word length to allow hyphenation of words as well as the minimum number of characters before and after the hyphen.

This property provides you with fine-grained control over hyphenation in text. This control enables you to avoid awkward hyphenations and set appropriate hyphenation for different languages, which, in turn, allows for better typography.

## Syntax

```css
/* Numeric values */
hyphenate-limit-chars: 10 4 4;
hyphenate-limit-chars: 10 4;
hyphenate-limit-chars: 10;

/* Keyword values */
hyphenate-limit-chars: auto auto auto;
hyphenate-limit-chars: auto auto;
hyphenate-limit-chars: auto;

/* Mix of numeric and keyword values */
hyphenate-limit-chars: 10 auto 4;
hyphenate-limit-chars: 10 auto;
hyphenate-limit-chars: auto 3;

/* Global values */
hyphenate-limit-chars: inherit;
hyphenate-limit-chars: initial;
hyphenate-limit-chars: revert;
hyphenate-limit-chars: revert-layer;
hyphenate-limit-chars: unset;
```

The `hyphenate-limit-chars` property takes 1–3 values that can be numeric or `auto`, as explained below.

### Values

- `<number> <number> <number>`
  - : The first value is the minimum word length before words should be hyphenated. The second value is the minimum number of characters before the hyphen. The third value is the minimum number of characters after the hyphen.
- `<number> <number>`
  - : The first value is the minimum word length before words should be hyphenated. The second value is the minimum number of characters before the hyphen. The minimum number of characters after the hyphen will be set equal to the second value.
- `<number>`
  - : The value is the minimum word length before words should be hyphenated. The minimum number of characters before and after the hyphen will be set to `auto`.

If `auto` is set for any of the values, the user agent will choose an appropriate value for the current layout. Unless the user agent can calculate a better value, the following default values will be used:

- Minimum word length to allow hyphenation: 5
- Minimum number of characters before the hyphen: 2
- Minimum number of characters after the hyphen: 2

Note that if a word is too short to meet the given constraints, it will not be hyphenated. For example, given a value like `hyphenate-limit-chars: auto 3 4`, words shorter than 7 characters will never be hyphenated, since it is impossible to have 3 characters before the hyphen and 4 characters after it.

## Examples

### Setting hyphenation limits

In this example, we have four boxes each containing the same text. For the purpose of comparison, the first box shows the default hyphenation applied by the browser. The next three boxes demonstrate the result of constraining the browser's default behavior using different `hyphenate-limit-chars` values.

#### HTML

```html
<div class="container">
  <p id="ex1">juxtaposition and acknowledgement</p>
  <p id="ex2">juxtaposition and acknowledgement</p>
  <p id="ex3">juxtaposition and acknowledgement</p>
  <p id="ex4">juxtaposition and acknowledgement</p>
</div>
```

#### CSS

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(160px, 1fr));
}

p {
  margin: 1rem;
  width: 120px;
  border: 2px dashed #999999;
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  hyphens: auto;
}

#ex2 {
  hyphenate-limit-chars: 14;
}

#ex3 {
  hyphenate-limit-chars: 5 9 2;
}

#ex4 {
  hyphenate-limit-chars: 5 2 7;
}
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Setting hyphenation limits", "", 200)}}

In the first box, we don't set `hyphenate-limit-chars`, allowing the browser to apply its default algorithm. By default, the browser uses the values `5 2 2` unless it can find better values.

In the second box, we prevent the browser from hyphenating words unless they are at least 14 characters long by setting `hyphenate-limit-chars: 14`. As a result, "juxtaposition" is not hyphenated in the second box because it is only 13 characters long.

<!-- cSpell:ignore acknowled gement acknowl edgement ment -->

In the third box, we constrain the browser to include at least 9 characters before the hyphen by setting `hyphenate-limit-chars: 5 9 2`. The effect is that "acknowledgement" is now hyphenated as "acknowledge-ment" rather than the default version "acknowl-edgement", as shown in the first box.

Note that the browser does not have to include exactly 9 characters before the hyphen: as long as the constraints given in `hyphenate-limit-chars` are satisfied, the browser can break the word in the place it considers best. So in this case, for example, it chooses "acknowledge-ment" rather than the less readable "acknowled-gement".

<!-- cSpell:ignore juxtaposi tion -->

In the fourth box, we make the browser include at least 7 characters after the hyphen by setting
`hyphenate-limit-chars: 5 2 7`. The effect is that "juxtaposition" is hyphenated as "juxta-position" rather than the default "juxtaposi-tion".

# hyphens

The **`hyphens`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property specifies how words should be hyphenated when text wraps across multiple lines. It can prevent hyphenation entirely, hyphenate at manually-specified points within the text, or let the browser automatically insert hyphens where appropriate.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: hyphens")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
hyphens: none;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
hyphens: manual;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
hyphens: auto;
```

```html interactive-example
<section id="default-example">
  <p id="example-element">An extra­ordinarily long English word!</p>
</section>
```

```css interactive-example
#example-element {
  border: 2px dashed #999999;
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  text-align: left;
  width: 7rem;
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> In the above demo, the string "An extraordinarily long English word!" contains the hidden `&shy;` (soft hyphen) character: `An extra&shy;ordinarily long English word!`. This character is used to indicate a potential place to insert a hyphen when `hyphens: manual;` is specified.

Hyphenation rules are language-specific. In HTML, the language is determined by the [`lang`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/lang) attribute, and browsers will hyphenate only if this attribute is present and the appropriate hyphenation dictionary is available. In XML, the [`xml:lang`](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/xml:lang) attribute must be used.

> [!NOTE]
> The rules defining how hyphenation is performed are not explicitly defined by the specification, so the exact hyphenation may vary from browser to browser.

If supported, {{cssxref("hyphenate-character")}} may be used to specify an alternative hyphenation character to use at the end of the line being broken.

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword values */
hyphens: none;
hyphens: manual;
hyphens: auto;

/* Global values */
hyphens: inherit;
hyphens: initial;
hyphens: revert;
hyphens: revert-layer;
hyphens: unset;
```

The `hyphens` property is specified as a single keyword value chosen from the list below.

### Values

- `none`
  - : Words are not broken at line breaks, even if characters inside the words suggest line break points. Lines will only wrap at whitespace.
- `manual`
  - : Default value. Words are broken for line-wrapping only where characters inside the word suggest line break opportunities. See [Suggesting line break opportunities](#suggesting_line_break_opportunities) below for details.
- `auto`
  - : The browser is free to automatically break words at appropriate hyphenation points, following whatever rules it chooses. However, suggested line break opportunities (see [Suggesting line break opportunities](#suggesting_line_break_opportunities) below) will override automatic break point selection when present.

> [!NOTE]
> The `auto` setting's behavior depends on the language being properly tagged to select the appropriate hyphenation rules. You must specify a language using the `lang` HTML attribute to guarantee that automatic hyphenation is applied in that language.

> [!NOTE]
> If you apply [`word-break: break-all`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/word-break#break-all) then no hyphens are shown, even if the word breaks at a hyphenation point.

## Suggesting line break opportunities

There are two Unicode characters used to manually specify potential line break points within text:

- U+2010 (HYPHEN)
  - : The "hard" hyphen character indicates a visible line break opportunity. Even if the line is not actually broken at that point, the hyphen is still rendered.
- U+00AD (SHY)
  - : An invisible, "**s**oft" **hy**phen. This character is not rendered visibly; instead, it marks a place where the browser should break the word if hyphenation is necessary. In HTML, use `&shy;` to insert a soft hyphen.

> [!NOTE]
> When the HTML [`<wbr>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/wbr) element leads to a line break, no hyphen is added.

# hypot()

The **`hypot()`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [function](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_and_units/CSS_value_functions) is an exponential function that returns the [square root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root) of the sum of squares of its parameters.

While {{CSSxRef("pow")}} and {{CSSxRef("sqrt")}} only work on unitless numbers, `hypot()` accepts values with units, but they all must have the same [type](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_and_units/CSS_data_types).

## Syntax

```css
/* A <number> value */
width: hypot(2em); /* 2em */
width: hypot(3em, 4em); /* 5em */
width: hypot(30px, 40px); /* 50px */
width: hypot(48px, 64px); /* 80px */
width: hypot(3px, 4px, 5px); /* 7.0710678118654755px */
```

### Parameters

The `hypot(x [, ...]#)` function accepts one or more comma-separated calculations as its parameters.

- `x`, `x2`, ..., `xN`
  - : A calculation that resolves to a {{CSSxRef("&lt;number&gt;")}}, {{CSSxRef("&lt;dimension&gt;")}}, or {{CSSxRef("&lt;percentage&gt;")}}.

### Return value

Returns a {{CSSxRef("&lt;number&gt;")}}, {{CSSxRef("&lt;dimension&gt;")}}, or {{CSSxRef("&lt;percentage&gt;")}} (based on the inputs), which is the square root of the sum of squares of its parameters.

- If any of the inputs is `infinite`, the result is `+∞`.
- If a single parameter is provided, the result is the absolute value of its input. `hypot(2em)` and `hypot(-2em)` both resolve to `2em`.

### Sizes based on hypot function

This example shows how you can use the `hypot()` function to calculate sizes.

#### HTML

```html
<div class="boxes">
  <div class="box">100px</div>
  <div class="box one">100px</div>
  <div class="box two">141.42px</div>
  <div class="box three">250px</div>
</div>
```

#### CSS

Here we are using [CSS custom properties](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascading_variables/Using_CSS_custom_properties) to define the sizes to be used. First we declare the first size (`--size-0`) which is then used to calculate the other sizes.

- `--size-1` is calculated with the hypotenuse of `--size-0` (100px). This takes the square value and, as there is no other value, returns the square root of the value, which results in 100px.
- `--size-2` is calculated with the hypotenuse of `--size-0` (100px), twice. This takes the square of the value (100px \* 100px = 10000px<sup>2</sup>) and adds it to the square of `--size-0` again (10000px<sup>2</sup> + 10000px<sup>2</sup> = 20000px<sup>2</sup>) and returns the square root of the sum (√(20000px<sup>2</sup>)), which results in 141.42px.
- `--size-3` is calculated with the hypotenuse `--size-0` \* 1.5 (150px) and `--size-0` \* 2 (200px). The result is the square root of the sum of their squares: The values are squared (22500px<sup>2</sup> and 40000px<sup>2</sup>) and added together (62500px<sup>2</sup>), with the sum square-rooted (√(62500px<sup>2</sup>)) being 250px.

```css
:root {
  --size-0: 100px;
  --size-1: hypot(var(--size-0)); /*  100px */
  --size-2: hypot(var(--size-0), var(--size-0)); /*  141.42px */
  --size-3: hypot(
    calc(var(--size-0) * 1.5),
    calc(var(--size-0) * 2)
  ); /*  250px */
}
```

```css hidden
.boxes {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  justify-content: space-around;
}

.box {
  width: var(--size-0);
  height: var(--size-0);
  background-color: tomato;
  color: white;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

The sizes are then applied as the `width` and `height` values of the selectors.

```css
.one {
  width: var(--size-1);
  height: var(--size-1);
}
.two {
  width: var(--size-2);
  height: var(--size-2);
}
.three {
  width: var(--size-3);
  height: var(--size-3);
}
```

# ID selectors

The CSS **ID selector** matches an element based on the value of the element's [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/id) attribute. In order for the element to be selected, its `id` attribute must match exactly the value given in the selector.

```css
/* The element with id="demo" */
#demo {
  border: red 2px solid;
}
```

## Syntax

```css
#id_value {
  /* … */
}
```

Note that syntactically (but not specificity-wise), this is equivalent to the following [attribute selector](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors):

```css
[id="id_value"] {
  /* … */
}
```

The `id_value` value must be a valid [CSS identifier](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/ident). HTML `id` attributes which are not valid CSS identifiers must be [escaped](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/ident#escaping_characters) before they can be used in ID selectors.

## Examples

### Valid ID selectors

#### HTML

```html
<p id="blue">This paragraph has a blue background.</p>
<p>This is just a regular paragraph.</p>
```

```html
<!-- The next two paragraphs have id attributes
that contain characters which must be escaped in CSS -->

<p id="item?one">This paragraph has a pink background.</p>
<p id="123item">This paragraph has a yellow background.</p>
```

#### CSS

```css
#blue {
  background-color: skyblue;
}
```

```css
/* In the next two rules, the id attributes must be escaped */

#item\?one {
  background-color: pink;
}

#\00003123item {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Examples", '100%', 200)}}

### Invalid ID selectors

The ID selectors in the following rules are not valid CSS identifiers, and will be ignored.

```css example-bad
#item?one {
  background-color: green;
}

#123item {
  background-color: green;

# <ident>

The **`<ident>`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [data type](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_and_units/CSS_data_types) denotes an arbitrary string used as an {{glossary("identifier")}}.

## Syntax

A CSS identifier consists of one or more characters, which can be any of the following:

- any {{glossary("ASCII")}} character in the ranges `A-Z` and `a-z`
- any decimal digit (`0` to `9`)
- a hyphen (`-`)
- an underscore (`_`)
- any other {{glossary("Unicode")}} character `U+00A0` and higher (that is, any other non-ASCII Unicode character)
- an [escaped character](#escaping_characters)

Additionally, an identifier must not start with an unescaped digit, and must not start with an unescaped hyphen followed by an unescaped digit.

Note that `id1`, `Id1`, `iD1` and `ID1` are all different identifiers because they are [case-sensitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_sensitivity). On the other hand, since there are several ways to escape a character, `toto\?` and `toto\3F` are the same identifiers.

### Escaping characters

{{glossary("Escape character", "Escaping a character")}} means representing it in a way that changes how it is interpreted by a software system. In CSS, you can escape a character by adding a backslash (`\`) in front of the character. Any character, except the hexadecimal digits `0-9`, `a-f`, and `A-F`, can be escaped in this way. For example, `&` can be escaped as `\&`.

You can also escape any character with a backslash followed by the character's {{glossary("Unicode")}} {{glossary("code point")}} represented by one to six hexadecimal digits. For example, `&` can be escaped as `\26`. In this usage, if the escaped character is followed by a hexadecimal digit, do one of the following:

- Place a space or other whitespace character after the Unicode code point.
- Provide the full six-digit Unicode code point of the character being escaped.

For example, the string `&123` can be escaped as `\26 123` (with a whitespace) or `\000026123` (with the six-digit Unicode code point for `&`) to ensure that `123` is not considered as part of the escape pattern.

## Examples

### Valid identifiers

```plain example-good
nono79        /* A mix of alphanumeric characters and numbers */
ground-level  /* A mix of alphanumeric characters and a dash */
-test         /* A hyphen followed by alphanumeric characters */
--toto        /* A custom-property like identifier */
_internal     /* An underscore followed by alphanumeric characters */
\22 toto      /* An escaped character followed by alphanumeric characters */
\000022toto   /* Same as the previous example */
scooby\.doo   /* A correctly escaped period */
🔥123         /* A non-ASCII character followed by numbers */
```

### Invalid identifiers

```plain example-bad
34rem     /* Must not start with a decimal digit */
-12rad    /* Must not start with a dash followed by a decimal digit */
scooby.doo  /* ASCII characters apart from alphanumerics must be escaped */
'scoobyDoo' /* Treated as a string */
"scoobyDoo" /* Treated as a string */

/* Multiple <if-test>s */
if(
  style(--scheme: ice): linear-gradient(#caf0f8, white, #caf0f8);
  style(--scheme: fire): linear-gradient(#ffc971, white, #ffc971);
  else: none;
)

/* <if-test> within a shorthand */
3px yellow if(
  style(--color: green): dashed;
  style(--color: yellow): inset;
  else: solid;
)
```

### Parameters

The parameter is a semi-colon–separated list of `<if-branch>`es. Each `<if-branch>` is an `<if-condition>` followed by a colon and a `<value>`:

```plain
<if-branch> = <if-condition> : <value>;
```

- `<if-condition>`
  - : An `<if-test>` or the `else` keyword.
    - `<if-test>`
      - : A [style query](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_containment/Container_size_and_style_queries#container_style_queries), [media query](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries), or [feature query](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_conditional_rules/Using_feature_queries).

    - `else`
      - : A keyword representing an `<if-condition>` that always evaluates to true.

- `<value>`
  - : A property value.

### Return value

A value or {{glossary("guaranteed_invalid_value", "guaranteed-invalid")}}.

## Description

The CSS `if()` function provides conditional logic to CSS property values, and works in a similar fashion to JavaScript [`if...else`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else) statements.

The `if()` function can be used inside the value of any property, and can contain zero or more semi-colon-separated `<if-condition>`s. Each `<if-condition>` is either an `<if-test> : <value>` pair or an `else : <value>` pair. The semi-colon after the last `<if-condition>` is optional.

The return value is calculated as follows:

1. The `<if-condition>` expressions are evaluated, in the order they appear in the function.
2. The first `<if-condition>` that evaluates to `true` has its associated `<value>` returned.
3. If no `<if-condition>` evaluates to `true`, the function returns a {{glossary("guaranteed_invalid_value", "&lt;guaranteed-invalid&gt:")}}. This behaves as invalid or `false` if the `if()` function is used in a value statement that has a fallback, such as a [custom property](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) or an {{cssxref("anchor()")}} function.

For example:

```css-nolint
div {
  background-image: if(
    style(--scheme: ice): linear-gradient(#caf0f8, white, #caf0f8);
    style(--scheme: fire): linear-gradient(#ffc971, white, #ffc971);
    else: none;
  );
}
```

In this case, we are setting a different {{cssxref("linear-gradient()")}} as the {{cssxref("background-image")}} on {{htmlelement("div")}} elements, depending on whether a `--scheme` [custom property](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) is set to `ice` or `fire`. If `--scheme` doesn't exist, or it exists and is set to any other value, the `else` value comes into play, and the `background-image` property is set to `none`.

> [!NOTE]
> Each condition must be separated from its associated value with a colon, and each `<if-condition> : <value>` pair must be separated with a semi-colon. The semi-colon is optional for the last `<if-condition> : <value>` pair.

> [!WARNING]
> There must be no space between the `if` and the opening parenthesis (`(`). If there is, the whole declaration is invalid.

If a single `<if-condition>` or `<value>` is invalid, it does not invalidate the entire `if()` function; instead, the parser moves on to the next `<if-condition> : <value>` pair. If no `<if-condition>` nor `<value>` is valid, the function returns {{glossary("guaranteed_invalid_value", "guaranteed-invalid")}}.

### Frequency and position of `else : <value>` pairs

You can include multiple `else : <value>` pairs inside an `if()` function, in any position. However, in most cases, a single `else : <value>` pair at the end of the semi-colon-separated list is used to provide the default value that is always returned if none of the `<if-test>`s evaluate to true.

If you include an `else : <value>` pair before any `<if-test> : <value>` pairs, the conditions that follow it are not evaluated because `else` always evaluates to `true`. The following `if()` therefore always returns `none`, and the two `<if-test> : <value>` pairs are never evaluated:

```css-nolint
div {
  background-image: if(
    else: none;
    style(--scheme: ice): linear-gradient(#caf0f8, white, #caf0f8);
    style(--scheme: fire): linear-gradient(#ffc971, white, #ffc971)
  );
}
```

Debugging a value that is not behaving as expected is one case where you might want to put an `else : <value>` in a position other than the end of the value list. In the following example, we are trying to work out whether the first `<if-test> : <value>` pair is working properly. If it isn't, the `else : <value>` pair returns a value of `url("debug.png")` to display an image indicating that the first `<if-test> : <value>` pair needs fixing. The last two `<if-test> : <value>` pairs are again never evaluated.

```css-nolint
div {
  background-image: if(
    style(--scheme: ice): linear-gradient(#caf0f8, white, #caf0f8);
    else: url("debug.png");
    style(--scheme: fire): linear-gradient(#ffc971, white, #ffc971);
    else: none;
  );
}
```

Note that an `if()` function is still valid if it contains only an `else : <value>` pair, or nothing at all. The following property values are both valid:

```css
background-color: if(else: yellow);
background-image: if();
```

These functions are not useful. They were included to demonstrate their validity. In this case, the {{cssxref("background-color")}} value will always be set to `yellow` and the `background-image` will be set to its initial value. You would be better off setting the `background-color` directly to `yellow`, and the `background-image` to `initial` or `none`.

### Types of if-tests

An `<if-test>` accepts one of three query types. This section looks at each one in detail.

#### Style queries

A [style query](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_containment/Container_size_and_style_queries#container_style_queries) `<if-test>` allows you to test whether a particular property value is set on an element, and apply a value to a different property as a result. We walked through several style query examples earlier on; let's look at another example:

```css-nolint
background-image: if(
  style(--scheme: ice): linear-gradient(#caf0f8, white, #caf0f8);
  else: none;
);
```

If the `--scheme` custom property is set to a value of `ice` on the same element, the provided `linear-gradient()` value is returned. If not, then `none` is returned.

Using style queries inside `if()` statements has an advantage over {{cssxref("@container")}} queries — you can target an element with styles directly, based on whether a custom property is set on it, rather than having to check set styles on a container parent element.

You can also use `and`, `or`, or `not` logic inside style queries. For example:

```css-nolint
background-color: if(
  style((--scheme: dark) or (--scheme: very-dark)): black;
);

background-color: if(
  style((--scheme: dark) and (--contrast: hi)): black;
);

background-color: if(
  not style(--scheme: light): black;
);
```

A `@container` query does have some advantages — you can only set single property values at a time with `if()` style queries, whereas `@container` queries can be used to conditionally apply whole sets of rules. The two approaches are complementary, and have different uses.

Note that container style queries currently don't support regular CSS properties, just CSS custom properties. For example, the following won't work:

```css-nolint example-bad
if(
  background-color: if(style(color: white): black;);
)
```

#### Media queries

A [media query](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries) `<if-test>` can be used to set a value for a property depending on whether a media query test returns true.

You can use media types. For example, the following `<if-test> : <value>` pair returns a value of `white` on print media, while the `else` clause causes `#eeeeee` to be returned on non-print media.

```css-nolint
background-color: if(
  media(print): white;
  else: #eeeeee;
)
```

You can also use media features — the following returns a value of `0 auto` if the current viewport width is less than `700px`, or `20px auto` if this is not the case:

```css-nolint
margin: if(
  media(width < 700px): 0 auto;
  else: 20px auto;
)
```

This is really useful when you need to vary a single property value based on a media query result.

You can also use `and`, `or`, or `not` logic inside media queries. For example:

```css-nolint
border-color: if(
  media((width > 700px) and (width < 1000px)): blue;
);

border-color: if(
  media((width < 500px) or (orientation: landscape)): blue;
);

background-color: if(
  not media(width < 500px): blue;
  else: red
);
```

When you want to set multiple declarations or rules based on one media query, a regular {{cssxref("@media")}} construct is needed. The two approaches are complementary, and have different uses.

#### Feature queries

A [feature query](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_conditional_rules/Using_feature_queries) `<if-test>` can be used to set a value for a property depending on whether the browser supports a particular property value.

For example, the following returns an {{cssxref("color_value/lch()")}} color if `lch()` colors are supported, or an {{cssxref("color_value/rgb()")}} color if not:

```css-nolint
color: if(
  supports(color: lch(75% 0 0)): lch(75% 0 0);
  else: rgb(185 185 185);
)
```

Selector support queries also work. The following will return a value of `1em` if the browser supports the {{cssxref(":buffering")}} pseudo-class, or `initial` if not:

```css-nolint
margin-top: if(
  supports(selector(:buffering)): 1em;
  else: initial;
)
```

You can also use `and`, `or`, or `not` logic inside feature queries. For example:

```css-nolint
margin-top: if(
  supports((selector(:buffering)) and (color: blue)): 1em;
);

margin-top: if(
  supports((selector(:buffering)) or (color: not-a-color)): 1em;
);

margin-top: if(
  supports(not selector(:buffering)): 1em;
);
```

Feature queries are really useful inside `if()` statements when you need to vary a single property value based on support for a particular value or a separate property. When you want to set multiple declarations or rules based on one feature query, a regular {{cssxref("@supports")}} construct is better. The two approaches are complementary, and have different uses.

### Providing fallback values

The `if()` statement does not gracefully degrade; an explicit fallback needs to be provided for non-supporting browsers.

For example, in this case we provide a static {{cssxref("padding")}} value for browsers that don't support `if()`. Browsers that support `if()` will override the first declaration with the second one, which sets different padding values depending on whether or not the `--size: "2xl"` custom property is set.

```css
padding: 1em;
padding: if(style(--size: "2xl"): 1em; else: 0.25em);
```

> [!NOTE]
> Remember to include the `else` condition. In `if()`-supporting browsers, if no `else` value were included and `--size` was not equal to `"2xl"`, the padding would be set to `initial`.

### Whole and partial values

An `if()` function can be set as the value of any CSS property, but it can also be used to determine parts of property values. For example, the following sets a different {{cssxref("border-color")}} inside a {{cssxref("border")}} shorthand property, depending on whether {{cssxref("color_value/lch()")}} colors are supported:

```css-nolint
border: if(
  supports(color: lch(75% 0 0)): 3px solid lch(75% 0 0);
  else: 3px solid silver;
);
```

However, we could use the `if()` function to determine the {{cssxref("border-color")}} component only:

```css-nolint
border: 3px solid
  if(
    supports(color: lch(75% 0 0)): lch(75% 0 0); else: silver;
  );
```

### Nesting if() functions

Because an `if()` function can take the place of whole property values or individual components, it is possible to nest `if()` functions within other `if()` functions, and inside other functions such as {{cssxref("calc()")}}.

For example, in this declaration we are using `if()` to set a `color` property value depending on various conditions. We have an outer `if()` function that returns a particular value depending on whether the `--scheme` custom property is set to `ice` or `fire` (with an `else` value of `black` that is returned if neither of the conditions return true).

However, the two `<value>`s are also `if()` functions. These inner `if()` functions return a light color value if the user prefers a dark color scheme (determined using the [`prefers-color-scheme`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) media query), and a dark color value otherwise.

```css-nolint
color: if(
  style(--scheme: ice):
    if(
      media(prefers-color-scheme: dark): #caf0f8;
      else: #03045e;
    );
  style(--scheme: fire):
    if(
      media(prefers-color-scheme: dark): #ffc971;
      else: #621708;
    );
  else: black
);
```

In the next example, we set the `width` property equal to a `calc()` function that subtracts `50px` from a percentage of the parent element's width. The percentage is represented by an `if()` function, which test whether the `--scheme: wide` custom property is set. If so, the percentage is `70%`, so the outer function resolves to `calc(70% - 50px)`. If not, the percentage is `50%`, so the outer function resolves to `calc(50% - 50px)`.

```css-nolint
width: calc(if(
    style(--scheme: wide): 70%;
    else: 50%;
  ) - 50px);
```

## Examples

### Basic `if()` usage

In this example, we'll show basic usage of each of the three types of `<if-test>`.

#### HTML

Our HTML features a {{htmlelement("section")}} element with two {{htmlelement("article")}} elements inside it, containing `<h2>` [headings](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/Heading_Elements). The `<section>` has a custom property set on it inside its [`style`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/style) attribute — `--show-apple:true` — which we use later on to conditionally set a property value.

```html live-sample___basic
<section style="--show-apple:true">
  <article><h2>First article</h2></article>
  <article><h2>Second article</h2></article>
</section>
```

#### CSS

In our CSS, we first target the `<section>` element, laying it out with [flexbox](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout) and setting a {{cssxref("gap")}} between the two child `<article>` elements. We then use an `if()` function with an [`orientation`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/orientation) media query `<if-test>` to set the value of the {{cssxref("flex-direction")}} property to `row` if the document is in landscape orientation, or `column` if it is in portrait orientation. This lays out the `article` elements side-by-side in wide screens, and top-to-bottom in narrow screens.

```css hidden live-sample___basic
html {
  height: 100%;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

body,
section {
  height: inherit;
}

h2 {
  text-align: center;
}

article {
  background-color: cyan;
  border: 3px solid gray;
  flex: 1;
}
```

```css-nolint live-sample___basic
section {
  display: flex;
  gap: 16px;
  flex-direction: if(
    media(orientation: landscape): row;
    else: column;
  )
}
```

Next, we target the `<h2>` element's {{cssxref("::before")}} pseudo-element, setting its {{cssxref("content")}} property to an apple emoji, but only if `--show-apple: true` is set (we did this earlier with an inline {{htmlelement("style")}} in our HTML). We achieve this using an `if()` function with a [style query](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_containment/Container_size_and_style_queries#style_queries_for_custom_properties) `<if-test>`:

```css-nolint live-sample___basic
h2::before {
  content: if(
    style(--show-apple: true): "🍎 ";
  );
}
```

Finally, we target the `<h2>` element itself. We use a feature query `<if-test>` to test whether the browser supports `lch()` colors, and set the {{cssxref("color")}} property to an `lch()` color if so, or a hex equivalent if not.

```css-nolint live-sample___basic
h2 {
  color: if(
    supports(color: lch(29.57% 43.25 344.44)): lch(29.57% 43.25 344.44);
    else: #792359;
  )
}
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("basic", "100%", "240")}}

Note how the styling is applied. Test out the conditional styling for the first two `if()` queries by modifying the rendered demo using your browser's devtools:

- Remove the `<section>` element's `style` attribute and note how the apple emojis are no longer rendered.
- Change the `height` attribute of the embedding `<iframe>` to `1200px`. This will change the orientation from landscape to portrait. Note how the layout changes as a result.

### Controlling a color scheme with `if()`

This demo shows how you can start to have some real fun with CSS `if()` functions. Amongst other things, we use `if()` functions to conditionally set the values of some custom properties, enabling us to control the entire color scheme!

#### HTML

Our HTML contains an {{htmlelement("article")}} element with some content inside it — a top-level heading, a couple of {{htmlelement("p")}} elements, and an {{htmlelement("aside")}}. We also include a {{htmlelement("form")}} containing a {{htmlelement("select")}} drop-down that enables selecting a color scheme.

```html-nolint live-sample___color-scheme
<article>
  <h1>Main heading</h1>
  <p>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing elit.
    Quisque faucibus ex sapien vitae pellentesque sem placerat.
    In id cursus mi pretium tellus duis convallis.
  </p>
  <aside>
    <h2>An aside</h2>
    <p>
      Tempus leo eu aenean sed diam urna tempor. Pulvinar vivamus
      fringilla lacus nec metus bibendum egestas.
    </p>
  </aside>
  <p>
    Iaculis massa nisl malesuada lacinia integer nunc posuere. Ut
    hendrerit semper vel class aptent taciti sociosqu. Ad litora
    torquent per conubia nostra inceptos himenaeos.
  </p>
</article>
<form>
  <label for="scheme">Choose color scheme:</label>
  <select id="scheme">
    <option value="">Default</option>
    <option value="ice">Ice</option>
    <option value="fire">Fire</option>
  </select>
</form>
```

### JavaScript

Our JavaScript adds a [`change`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/change_event) event listener to the `<select>` element. When a new value is selected, our script sets the `<article>` element's [`class`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/class) attribute to equal that value.

```js live-sample___color-scheme
const articleElem = document.querySelector("article");
const selectElem = document.querySelector("select");

selectElem.addEventListener("change", () => {
  articleElem.className = selectElem.value;
});
```

### CSS

In our CSS, we give the `<body>` element a {{cssxref("max-width")}} of `700px` and center it using `auto` {{cssxref("margin")}} values. However, we use an `if()` function with a media query `<if-test>` to set the {{cssxref("margin-top")}} component inside the `margin` shorthand to `0` if the viewport's width is less than `700px`, and `20px` if it is wider. This means that on wide screens we get a bit of margin at the top of the content, but this is removed on narrow screens, where it looks a bit weird.

```css hidden live-sample___color-scheme
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

html {
  font-family: "Helvetica", "Arial", sans-serif;
}

p {
  line-height: 1.5;
}

form {
  padding-left: 20px;
  margin-top: 20px;
}

article h2 {
  margin: 0;
  font-size: 1.8rem;
}
```

```css-nolint live-sample___color-scheme
body {
  max-width: 700px;
  margin: if(
    media(width < 700px): 0;
    else: 20px;
  ) auto 0;
}
```

We then set the `--scheme` custom property to match the `<article>` element's `class` name. The class will set by our JavaScript when a new value is selected in our `<select>` element. You'll see the significance of the custom element value in the next CSS block.

```css live-sample___color-scheme
.ice {
  --scheme: ice;
}

.fire {
  --scheme: fire;
}
```

We can see the real power of CSS `if()` functions when we combine them with custom properties. Here we use `if()` functions to set our `--color1` and `--color2` custom properties to different color values depending on the value of the `--scheme` custom property. We then use the `--color1` and `--color2` values in our `<article>` element's {{cssxref("color")}}, {{cssxref("border")}}, and {{cssxref("background-image")}} properties, and our `<aside>` element's `color` and `background-color` properties.

We are controlling our entire color scheme via custom properties, with different values set via `if()` functions.

```css-nolint live-sample___color-scheme
article {
  padding: 20px;
  --color1: if(
    style(--scheme: ice): #03045e;
    style(--scheme: fire): #621708;
    else: black;
  );
  --color2: if(
    style(--scheme: ice): #caf0f8;
    style(--scheme: fire): #ffc971;
    else: white;
  );

  color: var(--color1);
  border: 3px solid var(--color1);
  background-image: linear-gradient(
    to left,
    var(--color2),
    white,
    var(--color2)
  );
}

aside {
  color: var(--color2);
  background-color: var(--color1);
  padding: 20px;
}
```

Finally, we use `if()` functions in a couple more places:

- We set our `<h1>` element's {{cssxref("font-size")}} to be `calc(3rem + 2vw)` if the viewport is wider than `700px`, and `3rem` otherwise. This means the font size updates dynamically with viewport width changes on wider screens, but stays the same on narrow screens.
- We set a suitable emoji as the {{cssxref("content")}} of our `<h1>` element's {{cssxref("::before")}} pseudo-class, depending on the value of the `--scheme` custom property.

```css-nolint live-sample___color-scheme
h1 {
  margin: 0;
  font-size: if(
    media(width > 700px): calc(3rem + 2vw);
    else: 3rem;
  );
}

h1::before {
  content: if(
    style(--scheme: ice): "❄️ ";
    style(--scheme: fire): "🔥 ";
    else: "";
  );
}
```

#### Result

This demo renders as follows:

{{EmbedLiveSample("color-scheme", "100%", "500")}}

# image-orientation

The **`image-orientation`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property specifies a layout-independent correction to the orientation of an image.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: image-orientation")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
image-orientation: none;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
image-orientation: from-image;
```

```html interactive-example
<section id="default-example">
  <img
    class="transition-all"
    id="example-element"
    src="/shared-assets/images/examples/hummingbird.jpg" />
</section>
```

```css interactive-example
#example-element {
  height: inherit;
}
```

## Syntax

```css
/* keyword values */
image-orientation: none;
image-orientation: from-image; /* Use EXIF data from the image */

/* Global values */
image-orientation: inherit;
image-orientation: initial;
image-orientation: revert;
image-orientation: revert-layer;
image-orientation: unset;
```

### Values

- `none`
  - : Does not apply any additional image rotation; the image is oriented as encoded or as other CSS property values dictate.
- `from-image`
  - : Default initial value. The [EXIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EXIF) information contained in the image is used to rotate the image appropriately.

> [!WARNING]
> `image-orientation: none;` **does not** override the orientation of non-secure-origin images as encoded by their [EXIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EXIF) information, due to security concerns. Find out more from [the CSS working group draft issue](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5165).

## Description

This property is intended _only_ to be used for the purpose of correcting the orientation of images which were shot with the camera rotated. It should _not_ be used for arbitrary rotations. For any purpose other than correcting an image's orientation due to how it was shot or scanned, use a {{cssxref("transform")}} property with the `rotate` keyword to specify rotation. This includes any user-directed changes to the orientation of the image, or changes required for printing in portrait versus landscape orientation.

If used in conjunction with other CSS properties, such as a {{cssxref("&lt;transform-function&gt;")}}, any `image-orientation` rotation is applied before any other transformations.

## Examples

### Orienting image from image data

The following image has been rotated through 180 degrees, and the `image-orientation` property is used to correct its orientation based on the EXIF data in the image. By changing the `image-orientation` to `none` you can see the effect of the property.

# image-rendering

The **`image-rendering`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets an image scaling algorithm. The property applies to an element itself, to any images set in its other properties, and to its descendants.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: image-rendering")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
image-rendering: auto;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
image-rendering: smooth;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
image-rendering: crisp-edges;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
image-rendering: pixelated;
```

```html interactive-example
<section id="default-example">
  <img
    class="transition-all"
    id="example-element"
    src="/shared-assets/images/examples/lizard.png" />
</section>
```

```css interactive-example
#example-element {
  height: 480px;
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

The {{Glossary("user agent")}} will scale an image when the page author specifies dimensions other than its natural size. Scaling may also occur due to user interaction (zooming). For example, if the natural size of an image is `100×100px`_,_ but its actual dimensions are `200×200px` (or `50×50px`), then the image will be upscaled (or downscaled) using the algorithm specified by `image-rendering`. This property has no effect on non-scaled images.

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword values */
image-rendering: auto;
image-rendering: smooth;
image-rendering: crisp-edges;
image-rendering: pixelated;

/* Global values */
image-rendering: inherit;
image-rendering: initial;
image-rendering: revert;
image-rendering: revert-layer;
image-rendering: unset;
```

### Values

- `auto`
  - : The scaling algorithm is UA dependent. Since version 1.9 (Firefox 3.0), Gecko uses _bilinear_ resampling (high quality).
- `smooth`
  - : The image should be scaled with an algorithm that maximizes the appearance of the image. In particular, scaling algorithms that "smooth" colors are acceptable, such as bilinear interpolation. This is intended for images such as photos.
- `crisp-edges`
  - : The image is scaled with an algorithm such as "nearest neighbor" that preserves contrast and edges in the image. Generally intended for images such as pixel art or line drawings, no blurring or color smoothing occurs.
- `pixelated`
  - : The image is scaled with the "nearest neighbor" or similar algorithm to the nearest integer multiple of the original image size, then uses smooth interpolation to bring the image to the final desired size. This is intended to preserve a "pixelated" look without introducing scaling artifacts when the upscaled resolution isn't an integer multiple of the original.

> [!NOTE]
> The values `optimizeQuality` and `optimizeSpeed` present in an early draft (and coming from its SVG counterpart {{SVGAttr("image-rendering")}}) are defined as synonyms for the `smooth` and `pixelated` values respectively.

> [!NOTE]
> The [CSS images](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_images) module defines a `high-quality` value for the `image-rendering` property to provide a preference for higher-quality scaling, however, this is not supported in any browsers.

### Setting image scaling algorithms

In this example, an image is repeated three times, with each having a different `image-rendering` value applied.

```html hidden
<div>
  <img
    class="auto"
    alt="A small photo of some white and yellow flower against a leafy green background. The image is about 33% smaller than the size it is being displayed at. This upscaling causes the image to appear blurry, with notable soft edges between objects."
    src="blumen.jpg" />
  <img
    class="smooth"
    alt="The same photo as the previous image, which is also being upscaled the same amount. Browsers that support the smooth value for the image-rendering property display the image with the maximize appearance."
    src="blumen.jpg" />
  <img
    class="pixelated"
    alt="The same photo as the previous image, which is also being upscaled the same amount. Browsers that support the pixelated value for the image-rendering property display the image as very pixelated. Individual pixels are clearly visible and edges appear much sharper."
    src="blumen.jpg" />
  <img
    class="crisp-edges"
    alt="The same photo as the previous images, which is also being upscaled the same amount. Browsers that support the crisp-edges value for the image-rendering property display the image as very pixelated. In these examples, there is virtually no perceivable difference between the pixelated and crisp-edges versions."
    src="blumen.jpg" />
</div>
```

```css hidden
img {
  height: 200px;
}
```

#### CSS

```css
.auto {
  image-rendering: auto;
}

.smooth {
  image-rendering: smooth;
}

.pixelated {
  image-rendering: pixelated;
}

.crisp-edges {

# image-resolution

{{SeeCompatTable}}

The **`image-resolution`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property specifies the intrinsic resolution of all raster images used in or on the element. It affects content images such as replaced elements and generated content, and decorative images such as `background-image` images.

The image resolution is defined as the number of image pixels per unit length, e.g., pixels per inch. By default, CSS assumes a resolution of one image pixel per CSS px unit; however, the `image-resolution` property allows a different resolution to be specified.

## Syntax

```css
image-resolution: from-image;
image-resolution: 300dpi;
image-resolution: from-image 300dpi;
image-resolution: 300dpi snap;

/* Global values */
image-resolution: inherit;
image-resolution: initial;
image-resolution: revert;
image-resolution: revert-layer;
image-resolution: unset;
```

### Values

- {{cssxref("&lt;resolution&gt;")}}
  - : Specifies the intrinsic resolution explicitly.
- `from-image`
  - : Uses the intrinsic resolution as specified by the image format. If the image does not specify its own resolution, the explicitly specified resolution is used (if given), else it defaults to `1dppx` (1 image pixel per CSS px unit).
- `snap`
  - : If the `snap` keyword is provided, the computed resolution is the specified resolution rounded to the nearest value that would map one image pixel to an integer number of {{glossary("device pixel", "device pixels")}}. If the resolution is taken from the image, then the used intrinsic resolution is the image's native resolution similarly adjusted.

> [!NOTE]
> As vector formats such as SVG do not have an intrinsic resolution, this property has no effect on vector images.

### Setting a high dpi for print

When printing the document, use a higher resolution.

```css
@media print {
  .my-image {

  }
}
```

### Use image resolution with fallback

Uses the resolution from the image. If the image does not have a resolution, use 300dpi rather than the default 1dppx.

```css
.my-image {
  image-resolution: from-image 300dpi;
}

# image-set()

The **`image-set()`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [functional](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_and_units/CSS_value_functions) notation is a method of letting the browser pick the most appropriate CSS image from a given set, primarily for high pixel density screens.

Resolution and bandwidth differ by device and network access. The `image-set()` function delivers the most appropriate image resolution for a user's device, providing a set of image options — each with an associated resolution declaration — from which the browser picks the most appropriate for the device and settings. Resolution can be used as a proxy for filesize — a user agent on a slow mobile connection with a high-resolution screen may prefer to receive lower-resolution images rather than waiting for a higher resolution image to load.

`image-set()` allows the author to provide options rather than determining what each individual user needs.

## Syntax

```css-nolint
/* Select image based on resolution */
image-set(
  "image1.jpg" 1x,
  "image2.jpg" 2x
);

image-set(
  url("image1.jpg") 1x,
  url("image2.jpg") 2x
);

/* Select gradient based on resolution */
image-set(
  linear-gradient(blue, white) 1x,
  linear-gradient(blue, green) 2x
);

/* Select image based on supported formats */
image-set(
  url("image1.avif") type("image/avif"),
  url("image2.jpg") type("image/jpeg")
);
```

### Values

- `<image>`
  - : The [`<image>`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image) can be any image type except for an image set. The `image-set()` function may not be nested inside another `image-set()` function.
- `<string>`
  - : A URL to an image.
- `<resolution>` {{optional_inline}}
  - : [`<resolution>`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/resolution) units include `x` or `dppx`, for dots per pixel unit, `dpi`, for dots per inch, and `dpcm` for dots per centimeter. Every image within an `image-set()` must have a unique resolution.
- `type(<string>)` {{optional_inline}}
  - : A valid MIME type string, for example "image/jpeg".

## Formal syntax

## Accessibility

Browsers do not provide any special information on background images to assistive technology. This is important primarily for screen readers, as a screen reader will not announce its presence and therefore convey nothing to its users. If the image contains information critical to understanding the page's overall purpose, it is better to describe it semantically in the document.

- [MDN Understanding WCAG, Guideline 1.1 explanations](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Guides/Understanding_WCAG/Perceivable#guideline_1.1_—_providing_text_alternatives_for_non-text_content)

## Examples

### Using image-set() to provide alternative background-image options

This example shows how to use [`image-set()`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-images-4/#funcdef-image-set) to provide two alternative {{cssxref("background-image")}} options, chosen depending on the resolution needed: a normal version and a high-resolution version.

```html live-sample___image-set-example
<div class="box"></div>
```

```css live-sample___image-set-example
.box {
  width: 400px;
  height: 200px;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: cover;

  background-image: image-set(
    url("https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/balloons-small.jpg")
      1x,
    url("https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/balloons-landscape.jpg")
      2x
  );
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("image-set-example", "", "250px")}}

### Using image-set() to provide alternative image formats

In the next example the `type()` function is used to serve the image in AVIF and JPEG formats. If the browser supports avif, it will choose that version. Otherwise it will use the jpeg version.

```html live-sample___image-set-type-example
<div class="box"></div>
```

```css live-sample___image-set-type-example
.box {
  width: 400px;
  height: 200px;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: cover;

  background-image: image-set(
    "https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/balloons-landscape.avif"
      type("image/avif"),
    "https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/balloons-landscape.jpg"
      type("image/jpeg")
  );
}

# image()

The **`image()`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [function](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_and_units/CSS_value_functions) defines an {{CSSxRef("&lt;image&gt;")}} in a similar fashion to the {{CSSxRef("url_function", "url()")}} function, but with added functionality including specifying the image's directionality, displaying just a part of that image defined by a media fragment, and specifying a solid color as a fallback in case none of the specified images are able to be rendered.

> [!NOTE]
> The CSS `image()` function should not confused with {{DOMxRef("HTMLImageElement/Image", '<code>Image()</code>, the <code>HTMLImageElement</code> constructor', '', 1)}}.

## Syntax

```css-nolint
/* Basic usage */
image("image1.jpg");
image(url("image2.jpg"));

/* Bidi-sensitive Images */
image(ltr "image1.jpg");
image(rtl "image1.jpg");

/* Image Fallbacks */
image("image1.jpg", black);

/* Image Fragments */
image("image1.jpg#xywh=40,0,20,20");

/* Solid-color Images */
image(rgb(0 0 255 / 0.5)), url("bg-image.png");
```

### Values

- `image-tags` {{optional_inline}}
  - : The directionality of the image, either `ltr` for left-to-right or `rtl` for right-to-left.
- `image-src` {{Optional_Inline}}
  - : Zero or more {{cssxref("url_value", "&lt;url&gt;")}}s or {{CSSxRef("&lt;string&gt;")}}s specifying the image sources, with optional image fragment identifiers.
- `color` {{optional_inline}}
  - : A color, specifying a solid background color to use as a fallback if no `image-src` is found, supported, or declared.

### Bi-directional awareness

The first, optional parameter of the `image()` notation is the directionality of the image. If included, and the image is used on an element with opposite directionality, the image will be flipped horizontally in horizontal writing modes. If the directionality is omitted, the image won't be flipped if the language direction is changed.

### Image fragments

One key difference between `url()` and `image()` is the ability to add a media fragment identifier — a starting point along the x and y axis, along with a width and height — onto the image source to display only a section of the source image. The section of the image defined in the parameter becomes a standalone image. The syntax looks like so:

```css
background-image: image("my-image.webp#xywh=0,20,40,60");
```

The background image of the element will be the portion of the image _myImage.webp_ that starts at the coordinate 0px, 20px (the top left-hand corner) and is 40px wide and 60px tall.

The `#xywh=#,#,#,#` media fragment syntax takes four comma separated numeric values. The first two represent the X and Y coordinates for the starting point of the box that will be created. The third value is the width of the box, and the last value is the height. By default, these are pixel values. The [spacial dimension definition in the media specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/#naming-space) indicates that percentages will be supported as well:

```plain
xywh=160,120,320,240        /* results in a 320x240 image at x=160 and y=120 */
xywh=pixel:160,120,320,240  /* results in a 320x240 image at x=160 and y=120 */
xywh=percent:25,25,50,50    /* results in a 50%x50% image at x=25% and y=25% */
```

The image fragments can be used in `url()` notation as well. The `#xywh=#,#,#,#` media fragment syntax is 'backwards compatible' in that a media fragment will be ignored if not understood, and won't break the source call when used with `url()`. If the browser doesn't understand the media fragments notation, it ignores the fragment, displaying the entire image.

Browsers that understand `image()` also understand the fragment notation. Therefore, if the fragment is not understood within `image()`, the image will be considered invalid.

### Color fallback

If a color is specified in `image()` along with your image sources, it acts as a fallback if the images are invalid and do not appear. In such cases, the `image()` function renders as if no image were included, generating a solid-color image. As a use case, consider a dark image being used as a background for some white text. A dark background color may be needed for foreground text to be legible, if the image does not render.

Omitting image sources while including a color is valid and creates a color swatch. Unlike declaring a {{CSSxRef("background-color")}}, which is placed under or behind all the background images, this can be used to put (generally semi-transparent) colors over other images.

The size of the color swatch can be set with the {{CSSxRef("background-size")}} property. This is different from the `background-color`, which sets a color to cover the entire element. Both `image(color)` and `background-color` placements are impacted by the {{CSSxRef("background-clip")}} and {{CSSxRef("background-origin")}} properties.

## Formal syntax

{{CSSSyntax}}

## Accessibility

Browsers do not provide any special information on background images to assistive technology. This is important primarily for screen readers, as a screen reader will not announce its presence and therefore convey nothing to its users. If the image contains information critical to understanding the page's overall purpose, it is better to describe it semantically in the document.

- [MDN Understanding WCAG, Guideline 1.1 explanations](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Guides/Understanding_WCAG/Perceivable#guideline_1.1_—_providing_text_alternatives_for_non-text_content)
- [Understanding Success Criterion 1.1.1 | W3C Understanding WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html)

This feature can help improve accessibility by providing a fallback color when an image fails to load. While this can and should be done by including a background-color on every background image, the CSS `image()` function allows adding allows only including background colors should an image fail to load, which means you can add a fall back color should a transparent PNG/GIF/WebP not load.

## Examples

### Directionally-sensitive images

```html
<ul>
  <li dir="ltr">Bullet is a right facing arrow on the left</li>
  <li dir="rtl">Bullet is the same arrow, flipped to point left.</li>
</ul>
```

```css
ul {
  list-style-image: image(ltr "rightarrow.png");
}
```

In the left-to-right list items — those with `dir="ltr"` set on the element itself or inheriting the directionality from an ancestor or default value for the page — the image will be used as-is. List items with `dir="rtl"` set on the `<li>` or inheriting the right-to-left directionality from an ancestor, such as documents set to Arabic or Hebrew, will have the bullet display on the right, horizontally flipped, as if `transform: scaleX(-1)` had been set. The text will also be displayed left-to-right.

{{EmbedLiveSample("Directionally-sensitive_images", "100%", 200)}}

### Displaying a section of the background image

```html
<div class="box">Hover over me. What cursor do you see?</div>
```

```css
.box:hover {
  cursor: image("sprite.png#xywh=32,64,16,16");
}
```

When the user hovers over the box, the cursor will change to display the 16x16 px section of the sprite image, starting at x=32 and y=64.

{{EmbedLiveSample("Displaying_a_section_of_the_background_image", "100%", 100)}}

### Putting color on top of a background image

```css hidden
.quarter-logo {
  height: 200px;
  width: 200px;
  border: 1px solid;
}
```

```css
.quarter-logo {
  background-image: image(rgb(0 0 0 / 25%)), url("firefox.png");
  background-size: 25%;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```

```html
<div class="quarter-logo">
  If supported, a quarter of this div has a darkened logo
</div>
```

The above will put a semi-transparent black mask over the Firefox logo background image. Had we used the {{cssxref("background-color")}} property instead, the color would have appeared behind the logo image instead of on top of it. Additionally, the entire container would have had the same background color. Because we used `image()` along with the {{CSSxRef("background-size")}} property (and prevented the image from repeating with the {{CSSxRef("background-repeat")}} property, the color swatch will only cover a quarter of the container.

The **`<image>`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [data type](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_and_units/CSS_data_types) represents a two-dimensional image.

## Syntax

The `<image>` data type can be represented with any of the following:

- An image denoted by the {{cssxref("url_value", "&lt;url&gt;")}} data type
- A {{CSSxRef("&lt;gradient&gt;")}} data type
- A part of the webpage, defined by the {{CSSxRef("element","element()")}} function

- Generated by a [paint worklet](/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS_Painting_API) with the {{CSSxRef("image/paint","paint()")}} function.

## Description

CSS can handle the following kinds of images:

- Images with _intrinsic dimensions_ (a natural size), like a JPEG, PNG, or other [raster format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics).
- Images with _multiple intrinsic dimensions_, existing in multiple versions inside a single file, like some .ico formats. (In this case, the intrinsic dimensions will be those of the image largest in area and the {{glossary("aspect ratio")}} most similar to the containing box.)
- Images with no intrinsic dimensions but with _an intrinsic aspect ratio_ between its width and height, like an SVG or other [vector format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics).
- Images with _neither intrinsic dimensions, nor an intrinsic aspect ratio_, like a CSS gradient.

CSS determines an object's _concrete size_ using (1) its _intrinsic dimensions_; (2) its _specified size_, defined by CSS properties like {{CSSxRef("width")}}, {{CSSxRef("height")}}, or {{CSSxRef("background-size")}}; and (3) its _default size_, determined by the kind of property the image is used with:

| Kind of Object (CSS Property)                                                                | Default object size                                                                                           |

The concrete object size is calculated using the following algorithm:

- If the specified size defines _both the width and the height_, these values are used as the concrete object size.
- If the specified size defines _only the width or only the height_, the missing value is determined using the intrinsic ratio, if there is any, the intrinsic dimensions if the specified value matches, or the default object size for that missing value.
- If the specified size defines _neither the width nor the height_, the concrete object size is calculated so that it matches the intrinsic aspect ratio of the image but without exceeding the default object size in any dimension. If the image has no intrinsic aspect ratio, the intrinsic aspect ratio of the object it applies to is used; if this object has none, the missing width or height are taken from the default object size.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all browsers support every type of image on every property. See the [browser compatibility section](#browser_compatibility) for details.

## Accessibility

Browsers do not provide any special information on background images to assistive technology. This is important primarily for screen readers, as a screen reader will not announce its presence and therefore convey nothing to its users. If the image contains information critical to understanding the page's overall purpose, it is better to describe it semantically in the document.

# paint()

The **`paint()`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [function](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_and_units/CSS_value_functions) defines an {{cssxref("&lt;image&gt;")}} value generated with a PaintWorklet.

## Syntax

```css
paint(workletName, ...parameters)
```

where:

- _workletName_
  - : The name of the registered worklet.
- _parameters_ {{optional_inline}}
  - : Optional additional parameters to pass to the paintWorklet

## Formal syntax

{{CSSSyntax}}

## Examples

### Basic CSS paint() usage

Given the following HTML:

```html live-sample___example-boxbg
<ul>
  <li>item 1</li>
  <li>item 2</li>
  <li>item 3</li>
  <li>item 4</li>
  <li>item 5</li>
  <li>item 6</li>
  <li>item 7</li>
  <li>item 8</li>
  <li>item 9</li>
  <li>item 10</li>
  <li>item N</li>
</ul>
```

In JavaScript, we register the [paint worklet](/en-US/docs/Web/API/PaintWorkletGlobalScope):

```js live-sample___example-boxbg
CSS.paintWorklet.addModule(
  "https://mdn.github.io/houdini-examples/cssPaint/intro/worklets/boxbg.js",
);
```

In the CSS, we define the `background-image` as a `paint()` type with the worklet name, `boxbg`, along with any variables (ex. `--box-color` and `--width-subtractor`) the worklet will use:

```css live-sample___example-boxbg
body {
  font: 1.2em / 1.2 sans-serif;
}
li {
  background-image: paint(boxbg);
  --box-color: hsl(55 90% 60%);
}

li:nth-of-type(3n) {
  --box-color: hsl(155 90% 60%);
  --width-subtractor: 20;
}

li:nth-of-type(3n + 1) {
  --box-color: hsl(255 90% 60%);
  --width-subtractor: 40;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("example-boxbg", "", "300px")}}

### CSS paint() with parameters

You can pass optional arguments in the CSS `paint()` function. In this example, we passed two arguments that control whether the `background-image` on a group of list items is `filled` or has a `stroke` outline, and the `width` of that outline:

```html hidden live-sample___example-highlight
<ul>
  <li>item 1</li>
  <li>item 2</li>
  <li>item 3</li>
  <li>item 4</li>
  <li>item 5</li>
  <li>item 6</li>
  <li>item 7</li>
  <li>item 8</li>
  <li>item 9</li>
  <li>item 10</li>
  <li>item N</li>
</ul>
```

```js hidden live-sample___example-highlight
CSS.paintWorklet.addModule(
  "https://mdn.github.io/houdini-examples/cssPaint/intro/worklets/hilite.js",
);
```

```css live-sample___example-highlight
body {
  font: 1.2em / 1.2 sans-serif;
}

li {
  --box-color: hsl(55 90% 60% / 100%);
  background-image: paint(hollow-highlights, stroke, 2px);
}

li:nth-of-type(3n) {
  --box-color: hsl(155 90% 60% / 100%);
  background-image: paint(hollow-highlights, filled, 3px);
}

li:nth-of-type(3n + 1) {
  --box-color: hsl(255 90% 60% / 100%);
  background-image: paint(hollow-highlights, stroke, 1px);
}
```

We've included a custom property in the selector block defining a boxColor. Custom properties are accessible to the PaintWorklet.

# !important

A `!` delimiter followed by the `important` keyword marks the declaration as important. The `!important` flag alters the rules selecting declarations inside the [cascade](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Cascade). A declaration that is not _important_ is called _normal_.

To mark a declaration important, add the _important flag_ (`!important`) after the value in the declaration. While white space is allowed between the delimiter and the keyword, the flag is generally written as `!important` without any white space.

```css-nolint
selector {
  property: value; /* normal declaration */
  property: value !important; /* important declaration (preferred) */
  property: value ! important; /* important declaration (not preferred) */
}
```

The `!important` comes after the value of the property value pair declaration, preceded by zero or more spaces. The important flag must be the last token in the declaration. In other words, there can be white space and comments between the flag and the declaration's ending semicolon, but nothing else.

## Impact on the cascade

When it comes to important declarations, the [cascade origin and layer orders](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Cascade) are reversed. Without the important flag, declarations in the author's style sheets override declarations in a user's style sheet, which override declarations in the user-agent's default style sheet.

When a declaration is important, the order of precedence is reversed. Declarations marked as important in the user-agent style sheets override all important declarations in the user style sheets. Similarly, all important declarations in the user style sheets override all important declarations in the author's style sheets. Finally, all important declarations take precedence over all animations.

> [!NOTE]
> All important declarations take precedence over all animations. `!important` is not valid within [@keyframes animation](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes) declarations.

Reversing the precedence order for important declarations ensures users with special needs, such as personalized color schemes or large fonts, can override author styles when needed by marking some declarations in their user's style sheet as important. It also guarantees malicious extensions can't override important user-agent styles, which might break functionality or negatively impact security.

Does anything have precedence over important declarations? Yes, [transitions](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_transitions). CSS transitions are a way to control the speed at which the property changes from one value to another. While transitioning from one value to another, a property will not match a specific important declaration.

```css
a {
  color: red !important;
  background-color: yellow;
  transition: all 2s linear;
}
a:hover {
  color: blue !important;
  background-color: orange !important;
}
```

In this example, the `color` and `background-color` properties will transition to the hovered state over two seconds. Even though default states are normal declarations and hover states are `!important` declarations, the transition does happen.

### Cascade layers

Within each of the three origins for style sheets – author, user, and user-agent – normal declarations in unlayered styles override layered style declarations, with the last declared having precedence over the layers declared before it. Important declarations reverse the order of precedence: important declarations in the first layer take precedence over important declarations in the next layer, and so on. Also, all the important declarations have precedence over important declarations made outside any layer.

### Inline styles

Inline styles are styles defined using the [`style`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/style) attributes. They can also be normal or important. Inline _normal_ styles take precedence over all _normal_ declarations, no matter the origin. Inline _important_ styles take precedence over all other _important_ author styles, no matter the layer, but important styles from user's or user-agent's style sheets and transitions override them.

### !important and specificity

While `!important` is not part of determining specificity, it is related. Important declarations override all other declarations from the same [origin and cascade layer](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Cascade).

```css
#myElement#myElement#myElement .myClass.myClass p:hover {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red !important;
}
```

This example displays a case of over-specifying a selector. No matter how high the selector [specificity](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Specificity) matches a normal declaration, an important declaration from the same source and cascade layer will always have precedence. In this case, the paragraph will always be red.

When two important declarations from the same origin and layer apply to the same element, browsers select and use the declaration with the highest specificity.

```css
#myElement p {
  color: green !important;
}

p {
  color: purple !important;
}
```

In this case, the selector specificity matters. Only if the selectors had the same specificity would source order matter.

## Impact on shorthand properties

Declaring a shorthand property with `!important` sets all of sub-properties as important. The two following selector style blocks are equivalent:

```css
p {
  background: blue !important;
}

p {
  background-image: none !important;
  background-position: 0 0 !important;
  background-size: auto auto !important;
  background-repeat: repeat !important;
  background-origin: padding-box !important;
  background-clip: border-box !important;
  background-attachment: scroll !important;
  background-color: blue !important;
}
```

This example shows one of the several reasons avoiding the important flag is generally recommended.

## Impact on custom properties

When the `!important` flag is added to a custom property value declaration, it makes the value assignment important. The `!important` flag is then stripped from the custom property value. The `!important` flag is not passed as part of the custom property value to the [`var()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/var) function.

```css
:root {
  --my-color: red !important;
  --my-color: blue;
}
p {
  color: var(--my-color);
}
blockquote {
  color: var(--my-color);
  color: purple;
}
```

```html hidden
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
<blockquote>This is a blockquote</blockquote>
```

In this example, the paragraph will be red, not blue, as the custom property value assignment is important. The blockquote will be purple, because the purple normal declaration comes after the normal red declaration.

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Impact_on_custom_properties', '500', '250') }}

## Best practices

Avoid using `!important` to override specificity. When intentionally creating important declarations for UI requirements, comment in your CSS code to explain to maintainers why they should not override that feature.

Even when working to override high-specificity styles not under your control, such as styles in a 3rd party plugin declared with an [id selector](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/ID_selectors), you don't need to use `!important`. Consider instead importing the 3rd party stylesheet script into a [named or anonymous layer](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer) as your first cascade layer, instead of using `!important`. As long as the external styles do not include important declarations, your styles will take precedence over the widget styles, no matter the specificity.

If you need to override an external stylesheet containing important declarations, create a cascade layer containing the needed overrides, and declare that layer first.

### Accessibility concerns

Important styles from a user stylesheet take precedence over the author style sheet's important declarations, meaning adding an `!important` flag to a site's styles will not prevent individual users with special requirements, such as large fonts, from being able to override your styles by adding important styles in their own user's style sheet.

This feature is supported in all browsers.

# CSS: Cascading Style Sheets

**Cascading Style Sheets** (**CSS**) is a [stylesheet](/en-US/docs/Web/API/StyleSheet) language used to describe the presentation of a document written in [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) or [XML](/en-US/docs/Web/XML/Guides/XML_introduction) (including XML dialects such as [SVG](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG), [MathML](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML) or {{Glossary("XHTML")}}). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

CSS is among the core languages of the **open web** and is standardized across Web browsers according to [W3C specifications](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/#specs). Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now just "CSS" with individual CSS modules having version numbers.

After CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress on different CSS modules started to differ so much, that it became more effective to [develop and release recommendations separately per module](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work). Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of [the latest stable state of the CSS specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/css/) and individual modules progress. CSS modules now have version numbers, or levels, such as [CSS Color Module Level 5](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-5/).

# inherit

The **`inherit`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) keyword causes the element to take the [computed value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Value_processing#computed_value) of the property from its parent element. It can be applied to any CSS property, including the CSS shorthand property {{cssxref("all")}}.

For [inherited properties](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Inheritance#inherited_properties), this reinforces the default behavior, and is only needed to override another rule.

> [!NOTE]
> Inheritance is always from the parent element in the document tree, even when the parent element is not the containing block.

## Examples

### Exclude selected elements from a rule

```css
/* Make second-level headers green */
h2 {
  color: green;
}

/* Leave those in the sidebar alone so they use their parent's color */
#sidebar h2 {
  color: inherit;
}
```

In this example, the `h2` elements inside the sidebar might be different colors. For example, consider one of them that would by the child of a `div` matched by the rule:

```css
div#current {
  color: blue;
}
```

Then, it would be blue.

/* Global values */
initial-letter: inherit;
initial-letter: initial;
initial-letter: revert;
initial-letter: revert-layer;
initial-letter: unset;
```

### Values

The keyword value `normal`, or a `<number>` optionally followed by an `<integer>`.

- `normal`
  - : No special initial-letter effect. Text behaves as normal.
- `<number>`
  - : Defines the size of the initial letter, in terms of how many lines it occupies. Negative values are not allowed.
- `<integer>`
  - : Defines the number of lines the initial letter should sink when the size of it is given. Values must be greater than zero. If omitted, it duplicates the size value, floored to the nearest positive whole number.

### Setting initial letter size

#### HTML

```html
<p class="normal">Initial letter is normal</p>
<p class="onefive">Initial letter occupies 1.5 lines</p>
<p class="three">Initial letter occupies 3 lines</p>
```

#### CSS

```css
.normal::first-letter {
  -webkit-initial-letter: normal;
  initial-letter: normal;
}

.onefive::first-letter {
  -webkit-initial-letter: 1.5;
  initial-letter: 1.5;

### Setting the sink value

In this example, all the initial letters are the same size, but with different sink values.

#### HTML

```html
<p class="four">Initial letter: Sink value = 4</p>
<p class="same">Initial letter: Sink value not declared (same as size)</p>
<p class="two">Initial letter: Sink value = 2</p>
<p class="one">Initial letter: Sink value = 1</p>
```

#### CSS

```css
.four::first-letter {
  -webkit-initial-letter: 3 4;
  initial-letter: 3 4;
}

.same::first-letter {
  -webkit-initial-letter: 3;
  initial-letter: 3;
}

.two::first-letter {

# initial

The **`initial`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) keyword applies the [initial (or default) value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Value_processing#initial_value) of a property to an element. It can be applied to any CSS property, including the CSS shorthand property {{cssxref("all")}}. With `all` set to `initial`, all CSS properties can be restored to their respective initial values in one go instead of restoring each one separately.

On [inherited properties](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Inheritance#inherited_properties), the initial value may be unexpected. You should consider using the {{cssxref("inherit")}}, {{cssxref("unset")}}, {{cssxref("revert")}}, or {{cssxref("revert-layer")}} keywords instead.

## Examples

### Using initial to reset color for an element

#### HTML

```html
<p>
  <span>This text is red.</span>
  <em>This text is in the initial color (typically black).</em>
  <span>This is red again.</span>
</p>
```

#### CSS

```css
p {
  color: red;
}

em {
  color: initial;
}
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample('Using_initial_to_reset_color_for_an_element')}}

With the `initial` keyword in this example, `color` value on the `em` element is restored to the initial value of [`color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color#formal_definition), as defined in the specification.

- Use the {{cssxref("inherit")}} keyword to make an element's property the same as its parent.
- Use the {{cssxref("revert")}} keyword to reset a property to the value established by the user-agent stylesheet (or by user styles, if any exist).
- Use the {{cssxref("revert-layer")}} keyword to reset a property to the value established in a previous cascade layer.
- Use the {{cssxref("unset")}} keyword to set a property to its inherited value if it inherits or to its initial value if not.
- The {{cssxref("all")}} property lets you reset all properties to their initial, inherited, reverted, or unset state at once.
# inline-size

The **`inline-size`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property defines the size of an element's block along the [inline axis](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Grid_Axis). If the {{cssxref("writing-mode")}} is horizontal, it corresponds to the {{cssxref("width")}}; if the writing mode is vertical, it corresponds to the {{cssxref("height")}}. A related property is {{cssxref("block-size")}}, which defines the other dimension of the element.

# inset-block-end

The **`inset-block-end`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property defines the logical block end offset of an element, which maps to a physical inset depending on the element's writing mode, directionality, and text orientation. It corresponds to the {{cssxref("top")}}, {{cssxref("right")}}, {{cssxref("bottom")}}, or {{cssxref("left")}} property depending on the values defined for {{cssxref("writing-mode")}}, {{cssxref("direction")}}, and {{cssxref("text-orientation")}}.

# inset-inline

The **`inset-inline`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property defines the logical start and end offsets of an element in the inline direction, which maps to physical offsets depending on the element's writing mode, directionality, and text orientation. It corresponds to the {{cssxref("top")}} and {{cssxref("bottom")}}, or {{cssxref("right")}} and {{cssxref("left")}} properties depending on the values defined for {{cssxref("writing-mode")}}, {{cssxref("direction")}}, and {{cssxref("text-orientation")}}.

This {{glossary("inset properties", "inset property")}} has no effect on non-positioned elements.

# <integer>

The **`<integer>`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [data type](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_and_units/CSS_data_types) is a special type of {{cssxref("number")}} that represents a positive or negative whole number. Integers can be used in numerous CSS properties and descriptors, such as the {{cssxref("column-count")}}, {{cssxref("counter-increment")}}, {{cssxref("grid-column")}}, {{cssxref("grid-row")}}, and {{cssxref("z-index")}} properties and the {{cssxref("@counter-style/range", "range")}} descriptor.

## Syntax

The `<integer>` data type consists of one or several decimal digits, 0 through 9 inclusive, optionally preceded by a single `+` or `-` sign. There is no unit associated with integers.

> [!NOTE]
> There is no official range of valid `<integer>` values, and the specifications do not specify a range.

## Interpolation

When animated, values of the `<integer>` data type are {{Glossary("interpolation", "interpolated")}} using discrete, whole steps. The calculation is done as if they were real, floating-point numbers; the discrete value is obtained using the [floor function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_function). The speed of the interpolation is determined by the [easing function](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/easing-function) associated with the animation.

## Examples

### Valid integers

```plain example-good
12          Positive integer (without a leading + sign)
+123        Positive integer (with a leading + sign)
-456        Negative integer
0           Zero
+0          Zero, with a leading +
-0          Zero, with a leading -
```

### Invalid integers

```plain example-bad
12.0        This is a <number>, not an <integer>, though it represents an integer.
12.         Decimal points are not allowed.
+---12      Only one leading +/- is allowed.
ten         Letters are not allowed.
_5          Special characters are not allowed.
\35         Escaped Unicode characters are not allowed, even if they are an integer (here: 5).
\4E94       Non-arabic numerals are not allowed, even when escaped (here: the Japanese 5, 五).
3e4         Scientific notation is not allowed.

# interpolate-size

{{seecompattable}}

The **`interpolate-size`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property allows you to enable [animations](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animations) and [transitions](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_transitions) between a [`<length-percentage>`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length-percentage) value and an [intrinsic size](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Intrinsic_Size) value such as `auto`, [`fit-content`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/fit-content), or [`max-content`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max-content).

This property is typically used to animate the {{cssxref("width")}} and/or {{cssxref("height")}} of a container between a `<length-percentage>` and the full size of its content (i.e., between "closed" and "open" or "hide" and "reveal" states) when animating a non-box-model CSS property, such as {{cssxref("transform")}}, is not a viable solution.

> [!NOTE]
> The behavior opted-into by `interpolate-size` cannot be enabled by default across the web because many sites in the wild use stylesheets that assume intrinsic size values cannot be animated. Enabling it by default would cause several backwards-compatibility issues (see relevant [CSS WG discussion](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/626#issuecomment-2071016522)).

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword values */
interpolate-size: allow-keywords;
interpolate-size: numeric-only;

/* Global values */
interpolate-size: inherit;
interpolate-size: initial;
interpolate-size: revert;
interpolate-size: revert-layer;
interpolate-size: unset;
```

### Values

- `allow-keywords`
  - : Enables [interpolation](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Interpolation) between a [`<length-percentage>`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length-percentage) value and an intrinsic size value, to allow animation between the two.
- `numeric-only`
  - : The default behavior — intrinsic size values cannot be interpolated.

## Description

Setting `interpolate-size: allow-keywords` enables interpolation between a [`<length-percentage>`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length-percentage) value and an intrinsic size value. Note that it does not enable animating between two intrinsic size values. One end of the animation must be a `<length-percentage>`.

The `interpolate-size` value is inherited, so animating to (or from) an intrinsic size value can be enabled for an entire document by setting it on the document root:

```css
:root {
  interpolate-size: allow-keywords;
}
```

If you want to limit the scope, you can set it on the relevant container element. The following enables interpolating intrinsic sizes only for {{htmlelement("main")}} and its descendants:

```css
main {
  interpolate-size: allow-keywords;
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The {{cssxref("calc-size()")}} function's return values can also be interpolated. In effect, including `calc-size()` in a property value automatically applies `interpolate-size: allow-keywords` to the selection. However, because `interpolate-size` is inherited as explained above, it is the preferred solution for enabling intrinsic size animations in most cases. You should only use `calc-size()` to enable intrinsic size animations if they also require calculations.

### Values that can be interpolated

The following intrinsic values can currently be opted-in to animations:

- `auto`
- {{cssxref("min-content")}}
- {{cssxref("max-content")}}
- {{cssxref("fit-content")}}
- `content` (for containers sized using {{cssxref("flex-basis")}}).

## Formal definition

{{cssinfo}}

## Formal syntax

{{csssyntax}}

## Examples

### Basic `interpolate-size` usage

This example demonstrates how to set `interpolate-size: allow-keywords` on a document to enable animations involving an intrinsic size. The demo features a character badge/"name tag", which can be hovered or focused to reveal information about the character. The reveal is handled by a {{cssxref("height")}} transition between a set length and `max-content`.

#### HTML

The HTML contains a single {{htmlelement("section")}} element with [`tabindex="0"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/tabindex) set on it so it can receive keyboard focus. The `<section>` contains {{htmlelement("header")}} and {{htmlelement("main")}} elements, each with their own child content.

```html
<section tabindex="0">
  <header>
    <h2>Tanuki</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>Tanuki is the silent phantom of MDN.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Height</strong>: 3.03m</li>
      <li><strong>Weight</strong>: 160kg</li>
      <li><strong>Tech Fu</strong>: 7</li>
      <li><strong>Bad Jokes</strong>: 9</li>
    </ul>
  </main>
</section>
```

#### CSS

```css hidden
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

section {
  font-family: "Helvetica", "Arial", sans-serif;
  width: 175px;
  border-radius: 5px;
  background: #eeeeee;
  box-shadow:
    inset 1px 1px 4px rgb(255 255 255 / 0.5),
    inset -1px -1px 4px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.5);
}

header {
  padding: 0.7rem;
  border-bottom: 2px solid #cccccc;
}

main {
  padding: 10px;
}

h2 {
  margin: 0;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-size: 1.1rem;
  text-align: center;
  letter-spacing: 1px;
}

p,
li {
  font-size: 0.8rem;
  line-height: 1.5;
}

p {
  margin-top: 0;
}
```

In the CSS, we first set `interpolate-size: allow-keywords` on the {{cssxref(":root")}}, to enable it for the whole document.

```css
:root {
  interpolate-size: allow-keywords;
}
```

We then set the `<section>`'s {{cssxref("height")}} to `2.5rem` and {{cssxref("overflow")}} to `hidden` so only the `<header>` is shown by default, then specify a `transition` that animates the `<section>` `height` over 1 second during state change. Finally, we set the `<section>` `height` on {{cssxref(":hover")}} and {{cssxref(":focus")}} to `max-content`.

```css
section {
  height: 2.5rem;
  overflow: hidden;
  transition: height ease 1s;
}

section:hover,
section:focus {
  height: max-content;
}
```

The rest of the CSS has been hidden for brevity.

#### Result

Try hovering over the `<section>` or focusing it via the keyboard — it will animate to its full height, revealing all the content.

# isolation

The **`isolation`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property determines whether an element must create a new {{glossary("stacking context")}}.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: isolation")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
isolation: auto;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
isolation: isolate;
```

  border: 1px solid black;
  margin: 2em;
}

#example-element * {
  mix-blend-mode: multiply;
  color: #8245a3;

# justify-content

The [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) **`justify-content`** property defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the {{Glossary("main axis")}} of a flex container and the [inline axis](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Logical_properties#inline_direction) of grid and multicol containers.

}

#example-element > div {

}
```

## Syntax

```css
/* Positional alignment */
justify-content: center;
justify-content: start;
justify-content: end;
justify-content: flex-start;
justify-content: flex-end;
justify-content: left;
justify-content: right;

/* Normal alignment */
justify-content: normal;

/* Distributed alignment */
justify-content: space-between;
justify-content: space-around;
justify-content: space-evenly;
justify-content: stretch;

/* Overflow alignment (for positional alignment only)*/
justify-content: safe center;
justify-content: unsafe center;

/* Global values */
justify-content: inherit;
justify-content: initial;
justify-content: revert;
justify-content: revert-layer;
justify-content: unset;
```

### Values

- `start`
  - : The items are packed flush to each other toward the start edge of the alignment container in the main axis.

- `end`
  - : The items are packed flush to each other toward the end edge of the alignment container in the main axis.

- `flex-start`
  - : The items are packed flush to each other toward the start edge of the alignment container on the flex container's main-start side.
    This only applies to flex layout items. For items that are not children of a flex container, this value is treated like `start`.

- `flex-end`
  - : The items are packed flush to each other at the end edge of the alignment container on the flex container's main-end side.
    This only applies to flex layout items. For items that are not children of a flex container, this value is treated like `end`.

- `center`
  - : The items are packed flush to each other toward the center of the alignment container along the main axis.

- `left`
  - : The items are packed flush to each other toward the left edge of the alignment container. When the property's horizontal axis is not parallel with the inline axis, such as when [`flex-direction: column;`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-direction) is set, this value behaves like `start`.

- `right`
  - : The items are packed flush to each other toward the right edge of the alignment container in the appropriate axis. If the property's axis is not parallel with the inline axis (in a grid container) or the main-axis (in a flexbox container), this value behaves like `start`.

- `normal`
  - : Behaves as `stretch`, except in the case of multi-column containers with a non-`auto` [`column-width`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/column-width), in which case the columns take their specified `column-width` rather than stretching to fill the container. As `stretch` behaves as `start` in flex containers, `normal` also behaves as `start`.

- `space-between`
  - : The items are evenly distributed within the alignment container along the main axis. The spacing between each pair of adjacent items is the same. The first item is flush with the main-start edge, and the last item is flush with the main-end edge.

- `space-around`
  - : The items are evenly distributed within the alignment container along the main axis. The spacing between each pair of adjacent items is the same. The empty space before the first and after the last item equals half of the space between each pair of adjacent items. If there is only one item, it will be centered.

- `space-evenly`
  - : The items are evenly distributed within the alignment container along the main axis. The spacing between each pair of adjacent items, the main-start edge and the first item, and the main-end edge and the last item, are all exactly the same.

- `stretch`
  - : If the combined size of the items along the main axis is less than the size of the alignment container, any `auto`-sized items have their size increased equally (not proportionally), while still respecting the constraints imposed by {{cssxref("max-height")}}/{{cssxref("max-width")}} (or equivalent functionality), so that the combined size exactly fills the alignment container along the main axis.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For [flexboxes](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox), the `stretch` value behaves as `flex-start` or `start`. This is because, in flexboxes, stretching is controlled using the {{CSSXref("flex-grow")}} property.

- `safe`
  - : If the item overflows the alignment container, then the item is aligned as if the alignment mode is `start`. The desired alignment will not be implemented.

- `unsafe`
  - : Even if the item overflows the alignment container, the desired alignment will be implemented. Unlike `safe`, which will ignore the desired alignment in favor of preventing overflow.

## Description

Defined in the [CSS box alignment](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_box_alignment) module, `justify-content` applies to multicol containers, flex containers, and grid containers. The property does not apply to and has no effect on block containers.

This property shares many keyword values with the {{cssxref("align-content")}} property, but not all! `justify-content` isn't involved in baseline alignment, and therefore does not take baseline values.

In [flex layouts](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout), the property defines how positive free space is distributed between or around flex items along the main axis. This property impacts the space between elements in a line, not the space between lines. The alignment is done after the lengths and auto margins are applied, which means that when one or more flex items in a line have a {{cssxref("flex-grow")}} factor greater than `0`, the property has no effect as there is no space to distribute along that line. Also, as stretching along the main axis is controlled by {{cssxref("flex")}}, the `stretch` value behaves as `flex-start`.

With [grid layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout), this property distributes available space between or around grid columns, not grid items. If the grid container is larger than the grid itself, the `justify-content` property can be used to justify the grid along the inline axis, aligning the grid columns.

Grid `auto` track sizes (and only `auto` track sizes) can be stretched by the `align-content` and `justify-content` properties. Therefore by default, an `auto` sized track will take up any remaining space in the grid container. As the grid's inline size has to be less than the grid container's inline size for there to be space to distribute, the property has no effect in this case.

## Examples

### Basic grid example

In this example, we have a grid that is narrower than its grid container, and we use `justify-content` to distribute the available space evenly around and between the grid columns.

#### HTML

The {{htmlelement("section")}} container, our grid container to-be, has 16 nested {{htmlelement("div")}}s that will become grid items.

```html
<section class="container">
  <div>A</div>
  <div>B</div>
  <div>C</div>
  <div>D</div>
  <div>E</div>
  <div>F</div>
  <div>G</div>
  <div>H</div>
  <div>I</div>
  <div>J</div>
  <div>K</div>
  <div>L</div>
  <div>M</div>
  <div>N</div>
  <div>O</div>
  <div>P</div>
</section>
```

#### CSS

```css hidden
.container {
  margin: 5px;
  border: 1px solid;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

div {
  line-height: 2em;
  border: 1px solid;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  text-align: center;
}
```

We set the container width to `500px` and specify three columns, each `80px` wide, meaning there is `260px` of available space to distribute between or around them. We then set `justify-content: space-evenly`, which means there will be `65px` of space before, between, and after each column.

We set different widths (and background colors) to demonstrate how the justification is applied to the columns.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid: auto-flow / repeat(3, 80px);
  width: 500px;
  justify-content: space-evenly;
}

div {
  background-color: pink;
  width: 80px;
}

div:nth-of-type(n + 9) {
  width: 35px;
  background-color: lightgreen;
}

div:nth-last-of-type(3) {
  width: 250px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Basic grid example", "100%", 220)}}

Note that `justify-contents` aligns the columns and has no effect on the items or alignment in grid areas. Grid items, even those that overflow their grid cell, do not impact column justification.

### The safe keyterm

This example demonstrates the `safe` keyterm. We specify four centered flex items that are not allowed to wrap, and as a result, overflow their single flex-line container. By adding `safe` to `center` in the `justify-content` property, overflowing content behaves as if the alignment mode is `start`

```html hidden
<p><code>justify-content: center;</code></p>
<section class="container safe">
  <div>A</div>
  <div>B</div>
  <div>C</div>
  <div>D</div>
</section>
<p><code>justify-content: safe center;</code></p>
<section class="container safe-center">
  <div>A</div>
  <div>B</div>
  <div>C</div>
  <div>D</div>
</section>
<p><code>justify-content: safe center;</code> with 3 items</p>
<section class="container safe-center">
  <div>A</div>
  <div>B</div>
  <div>C</div>
</section>
```

```css hidden
.container {
  margin: 5px auto;
  border: 1px dashed;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

div {
  line-height: 1em;
  border: 1px solid;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  text-align: center;
  background-color: pink;
}
```

The container is set to `center`, with every container other than the first having the `safe` keyword added:

```css
.container {
  align-items: baseline;
  display: flex;
  width: 350px;
  height: 2em;
}

.safe {
  justify-content: center;
}

.safe-center {
  justify-content: safe center;
}

div {
  flex: 0 0 100px;
}
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("the safe keyword", "100%", 260)}}

As an item overflows the alignment container, with `safe` included the alignment mode behaves as `start` and the `center` alignment is not implemented. The `safe` keyterm has no effect if the items do not overflow the container.

### Visualizing flex item distribution

This example includes a multi-line wrapping flex layout. The second flex item has a positive flex growth factor, consuming all the available free space in the first flex line.

#### CSS

```css hidden
#container {
  margin: 5px auto;
  border: 1px dashed black;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

div {
  line-height: 2em;
  border: 1px solid;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  text-align: center;
}
```

```css
#container {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: row wrap;
  justify-content: space-between; /* Can be changed in the live sample */
  width: 510px;
}

div {
  line-height: 2em;
  flex: 0 0 120px;
  background-color: pink;
}

div:nth-of-type(2) {
  flex-grow: 1;
  background-color: yellow;
}

div:nth-of-type(n + 9) {
  flex: 0 0 35px;
  background-color: lightgreen;
}
div:last-of-type {
  flex: 0 0 300px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

```html hidden
<section id="container">
  <div>A</div>
  <div>GROW</div>
  <div>C</div>
  <div>D</div>
  <div>E</div>
  <div>F</div>
  <div>G</div>
  <div>H</div>
  <div>I</div>
  <div>J</div>
  <div>K</div>
  <div>L</div>
  <div>M</div>
  <div>N</div>
  <div>O</div>
  <div>P</div>
</section>
<select id="justifyContent">
  <option value="start">start</option>
  <option value="end">end</option>
  <option value="flex-start">flex-start</option>
  <option value="flex-end">flex-end</option>
  <option value="center">center</option>
  <option value="left">left</option>
  <option value="right">right</option>
  <option value="space-between" selected>space-between</option>
  <option value="space-around">space-around</option>
  <option value="space-evenly">space-evenly</option>
  <option value="stretch">stretch</option>
</select>
```

```js hidden
const justifyContent = document.getElementById("justifyContent");
justifyContent.addEventListener("change", (evt) => {
  document.getElementById("container").style.justifyContent = evt.target.value;
});
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Visualizing_flex_item_distribution", "100%", 180)}}

Select different keywords from the drop-down menu to visualize the different `justify-content` keyword values. Because an item on the first line can grow, there is no available space on that line for the `justify-content` property to distribute. With the `space-between` value, the first item on each line is flush with the main-start edge, and the last item is flush with the main-end edge. As a result, if a line has only one item, it will be aligned with the main-start edge (as seen in the last line). This is not the case for other `space-*` values, such as `space-evenly` and `space-around`, which center one-item flex-lines.

# justify-items

The [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) **`justify-items`** property defines the default {{CSSxRef("justify-self")}} for all items of the box, giving them all a default way of justifying each box along the appropriate axis.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: justify-items")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
justify-items: stretch;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
justify-items: center;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
justify-items: start;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
justify-items: end;
```

```html interactive-example
<section class="default-example" id="default-example">
  <div class="example-container">
    <div class="transition-all" id="example-element">
      <div>One</div>
      <div>Two</div>
      <div>Three</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

```css interactive-example
#example-element {
  border: 1px solid #c5c5c5;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  grid-auto-rows: 40px;
  grid-gap: 10px;
  width: 220px;
}

#example-element > div {
  background-color: rgb(0 0 255 / 0.2);
  border: 3px solid blue;
}
```

The effect of this property is dependent of the layout mode we are in:

- In block-level layouts, it aligns the items inside their containing block on the inline axis.
- For absolutely-positioned elements, it aligns the items inside their containing block on the inline axis, accounting for the offset values of top, left, bottom, and right.
- In table cell layouts, this property is _ignored_ (see [Box alignment for block, absolutely positioned, and table layouts](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_box_alignment/Box_alignment_in_block_abspos_tables))
- In flexbox layouts, this property is _ignored_ (see [Box alignment in flexbox](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_box_alignment/Box_alignment_in_flexbox))
- In grid layouts, it aligns the items inside their grid areas on the inline axis (see [Box alignment in grid layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_box_alignment/Box_alignment_in_grid_layout))

## Syntax

```css
/* Basic keywords */
justify-items: normal;
justify-items: stretch;

/* Positional alignment */
justify-items: center; /* Pack items around the center */
justify-items: start; /* Pack items from the start */
justify-items: end; /* Pack items from the end */
justify-items: flex-start; /* Equivalent to 'start'. Note that justify-items is ignored in flexbox layouts. */
justify-items: flex-end; /* Equivalent to 'end'. Note that justify-items is ignored in flexbox layouts. */
justify-items: self-start;
justify-items: self-end;
justify-items: left; /* Pack items from the left */
justify-items: right; /* Pack items from the right */
justify-items: anchor-center;

/* Baseline alignment */
justify-items: baseline;
justify-items: first baseline;
justify-items: last baseline;

/* Overflow alignment (for positional alignment only) */
justify-items: safe center;
justify-items: unsafe center;

/* Legacy alignment */
justify-items: legacy right;
justify-items: legacy left;
justify-items: legacy center;

/* Global values */
justify-items: inherit;
justify-items: initial;
justify-items: revert;
justify-items: revert-layer;
justify-items: unset;
```

This property can take one of four different forms:

- Basic keywords: one of the keyword values `normal` or `stretch`.
- Baseline alignment: the `baseline` keyword, plus optionally one of `first` or `last`.
- Positional alignment: one of: `center`, `start`, `end`, `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `self-start`, `self-end`, `left`, or `right`. Plus optionally `safe` or `unsafe`.
- Legacy alignment: the `legacy` keyword, followed by one of `left` or `right`.

### Values

- `normal`
  - : The effect of this keyword is dependent of the layout mode we are in:
    - In block-level layouts, the keyword is a synonym of `start`.
    - In absolutely-positioned layouts, the keyword behaved like `start` on _replaced_ absolutely-positioned boxes, and as `stretch` on _all other_ absolutely-positioned boxes.
    - In table cell layouts, this keyword has no meaning as this property is _ignored_.
    - In flexbox layouts, this keyword has no meaning as this property is _ignored._
    - In grid layouts, this keyword leads to a behavior similar to the one of `stretch`, except for boxes with an aspect ratio or an intrinsic size where it behaves like `start`.
- `start`
  - : The item is packed flush to each other toward the start edge of the alignment container in the appropriate axis.
- `end`
  - : The item is packed flush to each other toward the end edge of the alignment container in the appropriate axis.
- `flex-start`
  - : For items that are not children of a flex container, this value is treated like `start`.
- `flex-end`
  - : For items that are not children of a flex container, this value is treated like `end`.
- `self-start`
  - : The item is packed flush to the edge of the alignment container of the start side of the item, in the appropriate axis.
- `self-end`
  - : The item is packed flush to the edge of the alignment container of the end side of the item, in the appropriate axis.
- `center`
  - : The items are packed flush to each other toward the center of the alignment container.
- `left`
  - : The items are packed flush to each other toward the left edge of the alignment container. If the property's axis is not parallel with the inline axis, this value behaves like `start`.
- `right`
  - : The items are packed flush to each other toward the right edge of the alignment container in the appropriate axis. If the property's axis is not parallel with the inline axis, this value behaves like `start`.
- `baseline`, `first baseline`, `last baseline`
  - : Specifies participation in first- or last-baseline alignment: aligns the alignment baseline of the box's first or last baseline set with the corresponding baseline in the shared first or last baseline set of all the boxes in its baseline-sharing group.
    The fallback alignment for `first baseline` is `start`, the one for `last baseline` is `end`.
- `stretch`
  - : If the combined size of the items is less than the size of the alignment container, any `auto`-sized items have their size increased equally (not proportionally), while still respecting the constraints imposed by {{CSSxRef("max-height")}}/{{CSSxRef("max-width")}} (or equivalent functionality), so that the combined size exactly fills the alignment container.
- `anchor-center`
  - : In the case of [anchor-positioned](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning) elements, aligns the items to the center of the associated anchor element in the inline direction. See [Centering on the anchor using `anchor-center`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning/Using#centering_on_the_anchor_using_anchor-center).
- `safe`
  - : If the size of the item overflows the alignment container, the item is instead aligned as if the alignment mode were `start`.
- `unsafe`
  - : Regardless of the relative sizes of the item and alignment container, the given alignment value is honored.
- `legacy`
  - : Makes the value inherited by the box descendants. Note that if a descendant has a `justify-self: auto` value, the `legacy` keyword is not considered by the descend, only the `left`, `right`, or `center` value associated to it.

### Basic demonstration

In this example, we have a 2 x 2 grid layout. Initially the grid container is given a `justify-items` value of `stretch` (the default), which causes the grid items to stretch across the entire width of their cells.

If you hover or tab onto the grid container however, it is given a `justify-items` value of `center`, which causes the grid items to span only as wide as their content width, and align in the center of their cells.

```html
<article class="container" tabindex="0">

  <span>Second child</span>
  <span>Third child</span>

The effect of this property is dependent of the layout mode we are in:

- In block-level layouts, it aligns an item inside its containing block on the inline axis.
- For absolutely-positioned elements, it aligns an item inside its containing block on the inline axis, accounting for the offset values of top, left, bottom, and right.
- In table cell layouts, this property is _ignored_. Read more about [alignment in block, absolute positioned and table layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_box_alignment/Box_alignment_in_block_abspos_tables).
- In flexbox layouts, this property is _ignored_. Read more about [alignment in flexbox](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_box_alignment/Box_alignment_in_flexbox).
- In grid layouts, it aligns an item inside its grid area on the inline axis. Read more about [alignment in grid layouts](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_box_alignment/Box_alignment_in_grid_layout).

```

This property can take one of three different forms:

- Basic keywords: one of the keyword values `normal`, `auto`, or `stretch`.
- Baseline alignment: the `baseline` keyword, plus optionally one of `first` or `last`.
- Positional alignment:
  - one of: `center`, `start`, `end`, `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `self-start`, `self-end`, `left`, or `right`.
  - Plus optionally `safe` or `unsafe`.

### Values

- `auto`
  - : The value used is the value of the `justify-items` property of the parents box, unless the box has no parent, or is absolutely positioned, in these cases, `auto` represents `normal`.

    - In block-level layouts, the keyword is a synonym of `start`.
    - In absolutely-positioned layouts, the keyword behaves like `start` on _replaced_ absolutely-positioned boxes, and as `stretch` on _all other_ absolutely-positioned boxes.
    - In table cell layouts, this keyword has no meaning as this property is _ignored_.
    - In flexbox layouts, this keyword has no meaning as this property is _ignored._
    - In grid layouts, this keyword leads to a behavior similar to the one of `stretch`, except for boxes with an aspect ratio or an intrinsic size where it behaves like `start`.

### Basic demonstration

In the following example we have a 2 x 2 grid layout. Initially the grid container is given a `justify-items` value of `stretch` — the default — which causes the grid items to stretch across the entire width of their cells.

The second, third, and fourth grid items are then given different values of `justify-self`, to show how these override the `justify-items` value. These values cause the grid items to span only as wide as their content width, and align in different positions across their cells.

# Breadcrumb navigation

Breadcrumb navigation helps the user to understand their location in the website by providing a {{glossary("breadcrumb")}} trail back to the start page. The items typically display inline, with a separator between each item, indicating the hierarchy between individual pages.

![Links displayed inline with separators](breadcrumb-navigation.png)

## Requirements

Display the hierarchy of the site by displaying inline links, with a separator between the items, indicating the hierarchy between individual pages, with the current page appearing last.

## Recipe

Click "Play" in the code blocks below to edit the example in the MDN Playground:

```html live-sample___breadcrumb-example
<nav aria-label="Breadcrumb" class="breadcrumb">
  <ol>
    <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Category</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Sub Category</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Type</a></li>
    <li><span aria-current="page">Product</span></li>
  </ol>
</nav>
```

```css live-sample___breadcrumb-example
body {
  font: 1.2em sans-serif;
}

.breadcrumb {
  padding: 0 0.5rem;
}

.breadcrumb ol {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  list-style: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  align-items: end;
}

.breadcrumb li:not(:last-child)::after {
  display: inline-block;
  margin: 0 0.25rem;
  content: "→";
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("breadcrumb-example", "", "100px")}}

> [!NOTE]
> The example above uses a complex selector to insert content before every `li` except the last one. This could also be achieved using a complex selector targeting all `li` elements except the first:
>
> ```css
> .breadcrumb li:not(:first-child)::before {
>   content: "→";
> }
> ```
>
> Feel free to choose the solution that you prefer.

## Choices made

To display list items inline, we use [flexbox layout](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Flexbox), thus demonstrating how a line of CSS can give us our navigation. The separators are added using [CSS generated content](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_generated_content). You could change these to any separator that you like.

## Accessibility concerns

We used the [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) and [`aria-current`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-current) attributes to help assistive technology users understand what this navigation is and where the current page is in the structure. See the related links for more information.

Be aware that the separator arrows `→` added via the {{cssxref("content")}} CSS property in the example above are exposed to assistive technologies (AT), including screen readers and braille displays. For a quieter solution, use a decorative {{HTMLElement("img")}} in your HTML with an empty `alt` attribute. An ARIA [`role`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles) set to [`none`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/none_role) or [`presentation`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/presentation_role) will also prevent the image from being exposed to AT.

Alternatively, silence the [CSS generated content](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_generated_content) by including an empty string as alternative text, preceded by a slash (`/`); for example, `content: url("arrow.png") / "";`.

If including generated separators that will be exposed to AT, opt for creating the generated content using the {{cssxref("::after")}} pseudo-element selector instead of {{cssxref("::before")}}, so the separator content is announced after the HTML content instead of before it.

# Card

This pattern is a list of "card" components with optional footers. A card contains a title, an image, a description or other content, and an attribution or footer. Cards are generally displayed within a group or collection.

![Three card components in a row](cards.png)

## Requirements

Create a group of cards, with each card component containing a heading, image, content, and, optionally, a footer.

Each card in the group of cards should be the same height. The optional card footer should stick to the bottom of the card.

The cards in the group should line up in two dimensions — both vertically and horizontally.

```css live-sample___card-example

  background-color: #333333;
  color: white;
  padding: 0.5rem;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("card-example", "", "950px")}}

## Choices made

Each card is laid out using [CSS grid layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout) despite the layout being one-dimensional. This enables the use of content sizing for the grid tracks. To set up a single-column grid we can use the following:

```css
.card {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: max-content 200px 1fr;
}
```

{{cssxref("display", "display: grid")}} converts the element into a grid container. The three values of the {{cssxref("grid-template-rows")}} property divide the grid into a minimum of three rows, defining the height of the first three children of the card, in order.

Each `card` contains a {{HTMLElement("header")}}, {{HTMLElement("img")}}, and {{HTMLElement("div")}}, in that order, with some also containing a {{HTMLElement("footer")}}.

The heading row, or track, is set to {{cssxref("max-content")}}, which prevents it from stretching. The image track is set to 200 pixels tall. The third track, where the content lives, is set to `1fr`. This means it will fill any additional space.

Any children beyond the three with explicitly defined sizes create rows in the implicit grid, which fits the content added to it. These are auto-sized by default. If a card contains a footer, it is auto-sized. The footer, when present, sticks to the bottom of the grid. The footer is auto-sized to fit its content; the content `<div>` then stretches take up any additional space.

The following ruleset creates the grid of cards:

```css
.cards {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(230px, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;
}
```

The {{cssxref("grid-template-columns")}} property defines the widths of the grid columns. In this case, we set the grid to auto-fill, with repeated columns that are minimally `230px` but allowed to grow to fill the available space. The {{cssxref("gap")}} property sets a gap of `20px` between adjacent rows and adjacent columns.

> [!NOTE]
> The various elements in separate cards do not align with each other, as each card is an independent grid. Lining up the components in each card with the same components in adjacent cards can be done with [subgrid](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Subgrid).

## Alternative methods

[Flexbox](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout) can also be used to lay out each card. With flexbox, the dimensions of each card's rows are set with the {{cssxref("flex")}} property on each row, rather than on the card container.

With flexbox, the dimensions of the flex items are defined on the children rather than the parent. Whether you choose to use grid or flexbox depends on your preference, whether you prefer controlling the tracks from the container or prefer adding rules to the items.

We chose grid for the cards as, generally, you want cards to be lined up both vertically and horizontally. Additionally, lining up the components within each card to the components of adjacent cards can be done with subgrid. Flex has no hack-free equivalent to subgrid.

## Accessibility concerns

Depending on the content of your card, there may be things you could or should do to enhance accessibility. See [Inclusive components: Card](https://inclusive-components.design/cards/) by Heydon Pickering, for a very detailed explanation of these issues.

# Center an element

In this recipe, you will see how to center one box inside another by using [flexbox](#using_flexbox) and [grid](#using_grid), centering content both horizontally and vertically.

![an element centered inside a larger box](cookbook-center.png)

## Requirements

To place an item into the center of another box horizontally and vertically.

## Recipe

Click "Play" in the code blocks below to edit the example in the MDN Playground:

```html live-sample___center-example
<div class="container">
  <div class="item">I am centered!</div>
</div>
```

```css live-sample___center-example
.item {
  border: 2px solid rgb(95 97 110);
  border-radius: 0.5em;
  padding: 20px;
  width: 10em;
}

.container {
  border: 2px solid rgb(75 70 74);
  border-radius: 0.5em;
  font: 1.2em sans-serif;

  height: 200px;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("center-example", "", "250px")}}

## Using flexbox

To center a box within another box, first turn the containing box into a [flex container](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox#the_flex_container) by setting its {{cssxref("display")}} property to `flex`. Then set {{cssxref("align-items")}} to `center` for vertical centering (on the block axis) and {{cssxref("justify-content")}} to `center` for horizontal centering (on the inline axis). And that's all it takes to center one box inside another!

### HTML

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="item">I am centered!</div>
</div>
```

### CSS

```css
div {
  border: solid 3px;
  padding: 1em;
  max-width: 75%;
}

.item {
  border: 2px solid rgb(95 97 110);
  border-radius: 0.5em;
  padding: 20px;
  width: 10em;
}

.container {
  height: 8em;
  border: 2px solid rgb(75 70 74);
  border-radius: 0.5em;
  font: 1.2em sans-serif;

  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

We set a height for the container to demonstrate that the inner item is indeed vertically centered within the container.

### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Using_flexbox", "", "200px")}}

Instead of applying `align-items: center;` on the container, you can also vertically center the inner item by setting {{cssxref("align-self")}} to `center` on the inner item itself.

## Using grid

Another method you can use for centering one box inside another is to first make the containing box a [grid container](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Basic_concepts_of_grid_layout#grid_container) and then set its {{cssxref("place-items")}} property to `center` to center align its items on both the block and inline axes.

### HTML

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="item">I am centered!</div>
</div>
```

### CSS

```css
div {
  border: solid 3px;
  padding: 1em;
  max-width: 75%;
}

.item {
  border: 2px solid rgb(95 97 110);
  border-radius: 0.5em;
  padding: 20px;
  width: 10em;
}

.container {
  height: 8em;
  border: 2px solid rgb(75 70 74);
  border-radius: 0.5em;
  font: 1.2em sans-serif;

  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
```

### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Using_grid", "", "200px")}}

Instead of applying `place-items: center;` on the container, you can achieve the same centering by setting {{cssxref("place-content", "place-content: center;")}} on the container or by applying either {{cssxref("place-self", "place-self: center")}} or {{cssxref("margin", "margin: auto;")}} on the inner item itself.

# Column layouts

You will often need to create a layout which has a number of columns, and CSS provides several ways to do this. Whether you use [Multi-column](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_multicol_layout), [Flexbox](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout), or [Grid](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout) layout will depend on what you are trying to achieve, and in this recipe we explore these options.

![three different styles of layouts which have two columns in the container.](cookbook-multiple-columns.png)

## Requirements

There are a number of design patterns you might want to achieve with your columns:

- [A continuous thread of content broken up into newspaper-style columns](#a_continuous_thread_of_content_—_multi-column_layout).
- [A single row of items arranged as columns, with all heights being equal](#a_single_row_of_items_with_equal_heights_—_flexbox).
- [Multiple rows of columns lined up by row and column](#lining_items_up_in_rows_and_columns_—_grid_layout).

## The recipes

You need to choose different layout methods in order to achieve your requirements.

### A continuous thread of content — multi-column layout

If you create columns using multi-column layout your text will remain as a continuous stream filling each column in turn. The columns must all be the same size, and you are unable to target an individual column or the content of an individual column.

You can control the gaps between columns with the {{cssxref("column-gap")}} or {{cssxref("gap")}} properties, and add a rule between columns using {{cssxref("column-rule")}}.

Click "Play" in the code blocks below to edit the example in the MDN Playground:

```html live-sample___multi-column-layout-example
<div class="container">
  <p>
    Veggies es bonus vobis, proinde vos postulo essum magis kohlrabi welsh onion
    daikon amaranth tatsoi tomatillo melon azuki bean garlic.
  </p>
  <p>
    Gumbo beet greens corn soko endive gumbo gourd. Parsley shallot courgette
    tatsoi pea sprouts fava bean collard greens dandelion okra wakame tomato.
    Dandelion cucumber earthnut pea peanut soko zucchini.
  </p>
  <p>
    Turnip greens yarrow ricebean rutabaga endive cauliflower sea lettuce
    kohlrabi amaranth water spinach avocado daikon napa cabbage asparagus winter
    purslane kale. Celery potato scallion desert raisin horseradish spinach
  </p>
</div>
```

```css live-sample___multi-column-layout-example
.container {
  border: 2px solid rgb(75 70 74);
  border-radius: 0.5em;
  padding: 20px;
  font: 1.2em sans-serif;

  column-width: 10em;
  column-rule: 1px solid rgb(75 70 74);
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("multi-column-layout-example", "", "350px")}}

In this example, we used the {{cssxref("column-width")}} property to set a minimum width that the columns need to be before the browser adds an additional column. The {{cssxref("columns")}} shorthand property can be used to set the `column-width` and {{cssxref("column-count")}} properties, either of which can define the maximum number of columns allowed.

Use multicol when:

- You want your text to display in newspaper-like columns.
- You have a set of small items you want to break into columns.
- You do not need to target individual column boxes for styling.

### A single row of items with equal heights — flexbox

Flexbox can be used to break content into columns by setting {{cssxref("display", "display: flex;")}} to make a parent element a flex-container. Just adding this one property turns all the children (child elements, pseudo-elements, and text nodes) into flex items along a single line. Setting the same {{cssxref("flex")}} shorthand property with a single numeric value distributes all the available space equally, generally making all the flex items the same size as long as none have non-wrapping content forcing the item to be larger.

Margins or the `gap` property can be used to create gaps between items, but there is currently no CSS property that adds rules between flex items.

```html live-sample___columns-flexbox-example
<div class="container">
  <p>
    Veggies es bonus vobis, proinde vos postulo essum magis kohlrabi welsh onion
    daikon amaranth tatsoi tomatillo melon azuki bean garlic.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gumbo beet greens corn soko endive gumbo gourd. Parsley shallot courgette
    tatsoi pea sprouts fava bean collard greens dandelion okra wakame tomato.
    Dandelion cucumber earthnut pea peanut soko zucchini.
  </p>

  <p>
    Turnip greens yarrow ricebean rutabaga endive cauliflower sea lettuce
    kohlrabi amaranth water spinach avocado daikon napa cabbage asparagus winter
    purslane kale. Celery potato scallion desert raisin horseradish spinach
    carrot soko.
  </p>
</div>
```

```css live-sample___columns-flexbox-example
.container {
  border: 2px solid rgb(75 70 74);
  border-radius: 0.5em;
  padding: 20px 10px;
  font: 1.2em sans-serif;

  display: flex;
}

.container > * {
  padding: 10px;
  border: 2px solid rgb(95 97 110);
  border-radius: 0.5em;

  margin: 0 10px;
  flex: 1;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("columns-flexbox-example", "", "400px")}}

To create a layout with flex items that wrap onto new rows, set the {{cssxref("flex-wrap")}} property on the container to `wrap`. Note that each flex line distributes space for that line only. Items in one line will not necessarily line up with items on other lines, as you'll see in the example below. This is why flexbox is described as one-dimensional. It is designed for controlling layout as a row or a column, but not both at the same time.

```html live-sample___columns-flexbox-wrapping-example
<div class="container">
  <p>
    Veggies es bonus vobis, proinde vos postulo essum magis kohlrabi welsh onion
    daikon amaranth tatsoi tomatillo melon azuki bean garlic.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gumbo beet greens corn soko endive gumbo gourd. Parsley shallot courgette
    tatsoi pea sprouts fava bean collard greens dandelion okra wakame tomato.
    Dandelion cucumber earthnut pea peanut soko zucchini.
  </p>

  <p>
    Turnip greens yarrow ricebean rutabaga endive cauliflower sea lettuce
    kohlrabi amaranth water spinach avocado daikon napa cabbage asparagus winter
    purslane kale. Celery potato scallion desert raisin horseradish spinach
    carrot soko.
  </p>
</div>
```

```css live-sample___columns-flexbox-wrapping-example
.container {
  border: 2px solid rgb(75 70 74);
  border-radius: 0.5em;
  padding: 20px 10px;
  width: 500px;
  font: 1.2em sans-serif;

  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.container > * {
  padding: 10px;
  border: 2px solid rgb(95 97 110);
  border-radius: 0.5em;

  margin: 0 10px;
  flex: 1 1 200px;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("columns-flexbox-wrapping-example", "", "450px")}}

Use flexbox:

- For single rows or columns of items.
- When you want to do alignment on the cross axis after laying out your items.
- When you are happy for wrapped items to share out space along their line only and not line up with items in other lines.

### Lining items up in rows and columns — grid layout

If you want a two-dimensional grid where items line up in rows _and_ columns, then you should choose CSS grid layout. Similar to how flexbox works on the direct children of the flex container, grid layout works on the direct children of the grid container. Just set {{cssxref("display", "display: grid;")}} on the container. Properties set on this container — like {{cssxref("grid-template-columns")}} and {{cssxref("grid-template-rows")}} — define how the items are distributed along rows and columns.

.container > * {

```

{{EmbedLiveSample("grid-layout-example", "", "450px")}}

Use grid:

- For multiple rows or columns of items.
- When you want to be able to align the items on the block and inline axes.
- When you want items to line up in rows and columns.

If you would like to contribute an example for the Layout Cookbook, then this page explains the steps to take to have your example published.

## What makes a good recipe?

**The simplest possible version of any useful web design pattern**. Each line of CSS that you include should be there to help demonstrate the pattern, so leave out anything there purely to make the example look pretty. The idea is that someone can take the pattern and use it in a site with their own styles.

A recipe consists of:

- A live example, stored in the [CSS Examples GitHub repo](https://github.com/mdn/css-examples).
- A downloadable version of that example, also stored in the CSS Examples repo.
- A page in the [CSS layout cookbook](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Layout_cookbook) section of the site, which should include the following components:
  1. Introduction
  2. Requirements
  3. Recipe
  4. Decisions
  5. Useful fallbacks or alternative methods (when relevant)
  6. Accessibility concerns
  7. Browser compatibility (only for CSS properties not fully supported)
  8. Additional resources

## Steps to publish a recipe

To create a recipe and add it to the CSS layout cookbook, follow these steps:

1. [Build a pattern](#1._build_a_pattern)
2. [Create a live example](#2._create_a_live_example)
3. [Create a downloadable version](#3._create_a_downloadable_version)
4. [Open a pull request with your example](#4._open_a_pull_request_with_your_example)
5. [Create your page](#5._create_your_page)

### 1. Build a pattern

Before turning your example into a recipe, start by creating your pattern as a basic HTML page. Think about what you are trying to demonstrate and keep it as simple as possible. Use descriptive words like "container" or "item" if adding class names.

Ensure that you've tested the HTML and CSS across multiple browsers, viewport sizes, and devices. Also ensure that any CSS styling follows accessibility guidelines. While it's okay to use CSS properties with limited support, be sure to include browser support information when creating the page, particularly in the browser compatibility section. In some cases, creating a second version of your example with fallback support can be helpful.

### 2. Create a live example

The live examples on cookbook pages, such as for [centering an element](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Layout_cookbook/Center_an_element), and elsewhere on MDN allow readers to play with the code and change relevant parts without being overwhelmed with all of the code. Your recipe will be demonstrated by way of one or more examples.

Fork the [CSS Examples repo](https://github.com/mdn/css-examples) and then take a look in the `css-cookbook` folder. There is a [cookbook-template.html](https://github.com/mdn/css-examples/blob/main/css-cookbook/cookbook-template.html) file. Copy this file and use it as a starting point. Save this in the `css-cookbook` directory with a name that makes sense for your pattern. The template contains comments to guide you in adding various parts at the appropriate places.

The important parts of this template are as follows:

- There is a stylesheet for the editor panels with some basic body styling and a JavaScript file for the editor functionality. Leave these files as they are.

- The `<head>` contains two style blocks. The first style block is for elements that readers do not need to change to play with the example. The second style block contains items that readers might want to play with. We typically add all our CSS to the first block, then choose the rules to move to the second block. The rules in the second block should be those that are fundamental to the pattern, perhaps those where a reader can change a CSS value and see the pattern update.

- You need to add the HTML for your component twice: first inside the section with the class `preview`, and then inside the `<textarea>` with the class `playable-html`.

- The editable CSS from the second `<head>` block must also be copied into the `playable-css` section.

A working example is [center.html](https://github.com/mdn/css-examples/blob/main/css-cookbook/center.html), which is embedded on the page [Center an element](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Layout_cookbook/Center_an_element). You can use this to see how to add the various bits correctly.

If you've forked the repo and have our CSS and JavaScript files with your example, opening your live example in a browser should display everything working exactly as it would appear on an MDN page.

#### Useful tips

- Do not indent the CSS and HTML inside the text areas; instead, align the code with the start of the lines. This will look better when it is rendered.
- If any images are required, put them in the directory with the examples. You are welcome to use any images already present.
- You can adjust the height of the text areas by changing the height in the inline styles.

### 3. Create a downloadable version

As the examples include all of our live example code, we want to provide readers with just the code they need for their example, omitting any unnecessary items. Create a copy of your live example, and add `--download` to its name. For example, the download version of `center.html` is `center--download.html`. This file will be similar to your initial example. It should be a basic version of your pattern as a single HTML page.

It can be handy to include the body CSS rules from our included stylesheet. Take a look at [`cookbook-template--download.html`](https://github.com/mdn/css-examples/blob/main/css-cookbook/cookbook-template--download.html) as a guide; these rules are provided as a starting point.

### 4. Open a pull request with your example

Open a pull request (PR) on the [CSS Examples repo](https://github.com/mdn/css-examples/pulls). This allows us to help you with any changes to the example that may be needed before you create your page. Plus, the example will need to be live to be included. This is why it makes sense to first create the code examples and then the explanatory guide. In your PR, explain the pattern and what you are demonstrating. See our [guidelines for opening a pull request](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Pull_requests#open_a_pull_request).

### 5. Create your page

After your example PR is merged, open a pull request to create a new page in the [Layout Cookbook directory](https://github.com/mdn/content/tree/main/files/en-us/web/css/layout_cookbook).
Use our [template for Cookbook pages](https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/css/layout_cookbook/contribute_a_recipe/cookbook_template/index.md?plain=1).
The template explains the requirements of each section, and you can refer to other cookbook examples for more help.

Remember to add a link to your new recipe on the main [Layout cookbook](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Layout_cookbook) page.

If you have any questions or want someone to take a look at your page, get in touch via any of our [communication channels](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels).

# Grid wrapper

The grid wrapper pattern is useful for aligning grid content within a central wrapper while also allowing items to break out and align to the edge of the containing element or page.

## Requirements

Items placed on the grid should be able to align to a horizontally-centered max-width wrapper or the outer edges of the grid, or both.

## Recipe

Click "Play" in the code blocks below to edit the example in the MDN Playground:

```html live-sample___grid-wrapper-example
<div class="grid">
  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>
      This item aligns to a central “wrapper” – columns that have a maximum
      width.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="full-width">
    <p>This item aligns to the edge of the grid container.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="left-edge">
    <p>
      This item aligns to the left edge of the grid container and the right edge
      of the wrapper.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="right-wrapper">
    <p>This item aligns to the right edge of the “wrapper” columns.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css live-sample___grid-wrapper-example
body {
  font: 1.2em sans-serif;
}
.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: minmax(20px, 1fr) repeat(6, minmax(0, 60px)) minmax(
      20px,
      1fr
    );
  grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px, auto);
  grid-gap: 10px;
}

.grid > * {
  border: 2px solid rgb(95 97 110);
  border-radius: 0.5em;
  padding: 20px;
}

.full-width {
  grid-column: 1 / -1;
}

.wrapper {
  grid-column: 2 / -2;
}

.left-edge {
  grid-column: 1 / -2;
}

.right-wrapper {
  grid-column: 4 / -2;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("grid-wrapper-example", "", "550px")}}

## Choices made

This recipe uses the CSS grid {{cssxref("minmax", "minmax()")}} function to define the grid track sizes in the {{cssxref("grid-template-columns")}} property. For the central columns with a maximum width, we can set a minimum value of `0` or greater and a maximum value that specifies the maximum size the column tracks will grow to. Using [relative](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#relative_length_units_based_on_font) or [absolute](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#absolute_length_units) {{cssxref("length")}} units (pixels, ems, rems) will create a fixed maximum size for the central wrapper, whereas using {{cssxref("percentage")}} values or [viewport units](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#relative_length_units_based_on_viewport) will cause the wrapper to grow or shrink in response to its context.

The outer two columns have a maximum size of `1fr`, meaning that they will each expand to fill the remaining available space in the grid container.

## Useful fallbacks or alternative methods

To center the grid horizontally on the page you can set a `max-width` along with left and right `auto` {{cssxref("margin")}}s:

```css
.grid {
  max-width: 96vw; /* Limits the width to 96% of the width of the viewport */
  margin: 0 auto; /* horizontally centers the container */
}
```

## Accessibility concerns

Although CSS grid enables positioning items anywhere (within reason), ensuring that your underlying markup follows a logical order is important (see [CSS grid layout and accessibility](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Grid_layout_and_accessibility) for more details).

# CSS layout cookbook

The CSS layout cookbook aims to bring together recipes for common layout patterns, things you might need to implement in your own sites. In addition to providing code you can use as a starting point in your projects, these recipes highlight the different ways layout specifications can be used, and the choices you can make as a developer.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to CSS layout then you might first like to take a look at our [CSS layout learning module](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout), as this will give you the basic grounding you need to make use of the recipes here.

## Contribute a Recipe

As with all of MDN we would love you to contribute a recipe in the same format as the ones shown above. See the [guide for adding Layout Cookbook recipes](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Layout_cookbook/Contribute_a_recipe) for a template and guidelines for writing your own example.
# List group with badges

In this recipe we will create a list group pattern with badges that indicate a count.

![A list of items with a badge indicating a count displayed to the right of the text.](list-group-badges.png)

## Requirements

The list items should be displayed with the badges. The badge should be aligned right and vertically centered. The badge must be centered vertically whether there is a single line of content or multiple lines of text.

## Recipe

Click "Play" in the code blocks below to edit the example in the MDN Playground:

```html live-sample___list-group-badges-example
<ul class="list-group">
  <li>
    Item One
    <span class="badge">2</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    Item Two
    <span class="badge">10</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    Item Three
    <span class="badge">9</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    Item Four
    <span class="badge">0</span>
  </li>
</ul>
```

```css live-sample___list-group-badges-example
body {
  font: 1.2em / 1.5 sans-serif;
  padding: 0;
  margin: 1em;
}
.list-group {
  list-style: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  border: 1px solid #cccccc;
  border-radius: 0.5em;
  width: 20em;
}

.list-group li {
  border-top: 1px solid #cccccc;
  padding: 0.5em;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}

.list-group li:first-child {
  border-top: 0;
}

.list-group .badge {
  background-color: rebeccapurple;
  color: white;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 80%;
  border-radius: 10em;
  min-width: 1.5em;
  padding: 0.25em;
  text-align: center;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("list-group-badges-example", "", "250px")}}

## Choices made

Flexbox makes this particular pattern straightforward and also facilitates making changes to the layout.

To ensure the text and badge line up correctly, I use the {{cssxref("justify-content")}} property with a value of `space-between`. This places any extra space between the items. In the live example, if you remove this property, you will see the badge move to the end of the text on items with text shorter than the one line.

To align the content horizontally, I use the {{cssxref("align-items")}} property to align the text and badge on the cross axis. If you want the badge to align to the top of the content instead, change this to `align-items: flex-start`.

# Recipe: Media objects

The _Media Object_ is a pattern we see all over the web. It refers to a two-column box with an image on one side and descriptive text on the other, e.g., a social media post.

![Example of a media object with profile image on the left side and lorem ipsum text to the right filling up 80% of the space](media-object.png)

## Requirements

Media Object pattern needs some or all of the following characteristics:

- Stacked on Mobile, two columns on Desktop.
- The image can be on the left or right.
- The image might be small or large.
- Media Objects can be nested.
- The Media Object should clear the contents no matter which side is tallest.

    grid-template-columns: 1fr fit-content(250px);
    grid-template-areas:
      "content image"
      "footer image";
  }

  .img {
    grid-area: image;
  }

  .content {
    grid-area: content;
  }

  .footer {
    grid-area: footer;
  }
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("media-objects-example", "", "1500px")}}

## Choices made

I have chosen to use [grid layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout) for the media object as it allows me to control the layout in two dimensions when I need to. This means that when we have a footer, with short content above, the footer can be pushed down to the bottom of the media object.

Another reason to use grid layout is in order that I can use {{cssxref("fit-content")}} for the track sizing of the image. By using `fit-content` with a maximum size of 200 pixels, when we have a small image such as the icon, the track only gets as large as the size of that image — the `max-content` size. If the image is larger, the track stops growing at 200 pixels and as the image has a {{cssxref("max-width")}} of 100% applied, it scales down so that it continues to fit inside the column.

By using {{cssxref("grid-template-areas")}} to achieve the layout, I can see the pattern in the CSS. I define my grid once the viewport is 500 pixels wide, so on smaller devices the media object stacks.

An option for the pattern is to flip it to switch the image to the other side — this is done by adding the `media-flip` class, which defines a flipped grid template causing the layout to be mirrored.

When we nest one media object inside another we need to place it into the second track in the regular layout, and the first track when flipped.

# Pagination

This cookbook pattern demonstrates the navigation pattern used to display pagination, where the user can move between pages of content such as search results.

![Links to sets of pages in a paged listing](pagination.png)

## Requirements

The pagination pattern typically displays items in a row. To ensure that the pagination is understandable by people using a screen reader, we mark the items up as a list inside a {{htmlelement("nav")}} element, and then use CSS to display the layout visually as a row.

Typically, the pagination component will be centered horizontally underneath the content.

## Recipe

Click "Play" in the code blocks below to edit the example in the MDN Playground:

```html live-sample___pagination-example
<nav aria-label="pagination">
  <ul class="pagination">
    <li>
      <a href="">
        <span aria-hidden="true">&laquo;</span>
        <span class="visuallyhidden">previous set of pages</span>
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href=""><span class="visuallyhidden">page </span>1</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="" aria-current="page">
        <span class="visuallyhidden">page </span>2
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href=""> <span class="visuallyhidden">page </span>3 </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href=""> <span class="visuallyhidden">page </span>4 </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="">
        <span class="visuallyhidden">next set of pages</span
        ><span aria-hidden="true">&raquo;</span>
      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

```css live-sample___pagination-example
.visuallyhidden {
  border: 0;
  clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
  height: auto;
  margin: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
  padding: 0;
  position: absolute;
  width: 1px;
  white-space: nowrap;
}

nav {
  border-top: 1px solid #eeeeee;
  margin-top: 1em;
  padding-top: 0.5em;
  font: 1.2em sans-serif;

  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}

.pagination {
  list-style: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  display: flex;
}

.pagination li {
  margin: 0 1px;
}

.pagination a {
  display: block;
  padding: 0.5em 1em;
  border: 1px solid #999999;
  border-radius: 0.2em;
  text-decoration: none;
}

.pagination a[aria-current="page"] {
  background-color: #333333;
  color: white;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("pagination-example")}}

## Choices made

This pattern is laid out using [flexbox](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout) — one flex container nested inside another. The {{htmlelement("nav")}} element is designated a flex container in order that we can center the list inside using the {{cssxref("justify-content")}} property.

The list itself also becomes a flex container to lay the items out as a row. To space the items out we can either use a {{cssxref("margin")}} on the flex items or add a {{cssxref("gap")}} on the flex container.

```css
.pagination {
  list-style: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  display: flex;
  gap: 2px;
}
```

## Accessibility concerns

We want to ensure that a person using a screen reader understands what this navigation does, and where they will go when clicking a link. To help with this we have added [`aria-label="pagination"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) on the `<nav>` element.

We have also added some additional content that would be read by a screen reader but is hidden visually, and set the [`aria-hidden`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-hidden) attribute on the paging arrows.

The "See Also" section at the end of this document has links to related accessibility topics.

# Split navigation

The **split navigation** is a navigation pattern where one or more elements are separated from the rest of the navigation items.

![Items separated into two groups.](split-navigation.png)

## Requirements

A common navigation pattern is to have one element pushed away from the others. We can use flexbox to achieve this, without needing to make the two sets of items into two separate flex containers.

## Recipe

Click "Play" in the code blocks below to edit the example in the MDN Playground:

```html live-sample___split-navigation-example
<nav>
  <ul class="main-nav">
    <li><a href="">About</a></li>
    <li><a href="">Products</a></li>
    <li><a href="">Our Team</a></li>
    <li class="push"><a href="">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

```css live-sample___split-navigation-example
.main-nav {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
  font: 1.2em sans-serif;

  display: flex;
}

.main-nav a {
  padding: 0.5em 1em;
  display: block;
}

.push {
  margin-left: auto;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("split-navigation-example")}}

## Choices made

This pattern combines auto margins with flexbox to split the items.

An auto margin absorbs all available space in the direction it is applied. This is how centering a block with auto margins works — you have a margin on each side of the block trying to take up all of the space, thus pushing the block into the middle.

In this case the left auto margin takes up any available space and pushes the item over to the right. You could apply the class `push` to any item in the list.

# Sticky footers

A sticky footer pattern is one where the footer of your page "sticks" to the bottom of the viewport in cases where the content is shorter than the viewport height. We'll look at a couple of techniques for creating one in this recipe.

## Requirements

The sticky footer pattern needs to meet the following requirements:

- Footer sticks to the bottom of the viewport when content is short.
- If the content of the page extends past the viewport bottom, the footer gets pushed down, always sitting below the content as normal.

## The recipe

Click "Play" in the code blocks below to edit the example in the MDN Playground:

```html live-sample___sticky-footer-example
<div class="wrapper">
  <header class="page-header">This is the header</header>
  <main class="page-body">
    <p contenteditable>
      The footer sticks to the bottom even though this paragraph is short. Add
      content to this editable area to see the footer push down when needed to
      fit the content.
    </p>
  </main>
  <footer class="page-footer">Sticky footer</footer>
</div>
```

```css live-sample___sticky-footer-example
* {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}

html {
  height: 100%;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  height: 100%;
  font: 1.2em sans-serif;
}

.wrapper {
  min-height: 100%;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
}

.page-header,
.page-footer {
  background-color: rgb(75 70 74);
  color: white;
  padding: 20px;
}

.page-body {
  padding: 20px;
}

.page-body p {
  border: 1px solid grey;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("sticky-footer-example", "", "400px")}}

> [!NOTE]
> In this example and the following one we are using a wrapper set to `min-height: 100%`. You can also achieve this for a full page by setting a {{cssxref("min-height")}} of `100vh` on the {{htmlelement("body")}} and then using it as your grid container.

## Choices made

In the above example we achieve the sticky footer using [CSS grid layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout). The `.wrapper` has a minimum height of `100%` which means it is as tall as the container it is in. We then create a single column grid layout with three rows, one row for each part of our layout.

[Grid auto-placement](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Auto-placement_in_grid_layout) will place our items in source order and so the header goes into the first auto sized track, the main content into the `1fr` track and the footer into the final auto sized track. The `1fr` track will take up all available space and so grows to fill the gap.

## Alternate method

You can also use [flexbox](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout) to create a sticky footer.

```html live-sample___sticky-footer-flexbox-example
<div class="wrapper">
  <header class="page-header">This is the header</header>
  <main class="page-body">
    <p contenteditable>
      The footer sticks to the bottom even though this paragraph is short. Add
      content to this editable area to see the footer push down when needed to
      fit the content.
    </p>
  </main>
  <footer class="page-footer">Sticky footer</footer>
</div>
```

```css live-sample___sticky-footer-flexbox-example
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

html,
body {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  height: 100%;
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  font: 1.2em sans-serif;
}

.wrapper {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  min-height: 100%;

  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.page-header,
.page-footer {
  background-color: rgb(75 70 74);
  color: white;
  padding: 20px;

  flex-grow: 0;
  flex-shrink: 0;
}

.page-body {
  padding: 20px;

  flex-grow: 1;
}

.page-body p {
  border: 1px solid grey;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("sticky-footer-flexbox-example", "", "400px")}}

The flexbox example starts out in the same way, but we use `display:flex` rather than `display:grid` on the `.wrapper`; we also set {{cssxref("flex-direction")}} to `column`. Then we set our main content to [`flex-grow: 1`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-grow) and the other two elements to [`flex-shrink: 0`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-shrink) — this prevents them from shrinking smaller when content fills the main area.

# left

The **`left`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property participates in specifying the horizontal position of a [positioned element](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position). This {{glossary("inset properties", "inset property")}} has no effect on non-positioned elements.

left: 10%;

/* Keyword value */
left: auto;

/* Global values */
left: inherit;

left: unset;
```

### Values

- {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}}
  - : A negative, null, or positive {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}}:
    - for _absolutely positioned elements_, it represents the distance to the left edge of the containing block.
    - for _anchor-positioned elements_, the {{cssxref("anchor()")}} function resolves to a {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}} value relative to the position of the associated _anchor element_'s left or right edge (see [Using inset properties with `anchor()` function values](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning/Using#using_inset_properties_with_anchor_function_values)), and the {{cssxref("anchor-size()")}} function resolves to a {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}} value relative to the associated anchor element's width or height (see [Setting element position based on anchor size](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning/Using#setting_element_position_based_on_anchor_size)).
    - for _relatively positioned elements_, it represents the distance that the element is moved to the right of its normal position.

- {{cssxref("&lt;percentage&gt;")}}
  - : A {{cssxref("&lt;percentage&gt;")}} of the containing block's width.
- `auto`
  - : Specifies that:
    - for _absolutely positioned elements_, the position of the element is based on the {{Cssxref("right")}} property, while `width: auto` is treated as a width based on the content; or if `right` is also `auto`, the element is positioned where it should horizontally be positioned if it were a static element.
    - for _relatively positioned elements_, the distance of the element from its normal position is based on the {{Cssxref("right")}} property; or if `right` is also `auto`, the element is not moved horizontally at all.

## Description

The effect of `left` depends on how the element is positioned (i.e., the value of the {{cssxref("position")}} property):

- When `position` is set to `absolute` or `fixed`, the `left` property specifies the distance between the element's outer margin of left edge and the inner border of left edge of its containing block. (The containing block is the ancestor to which the element is relatively positioned.) If the positioned element has an associated [_anchor element_](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning/Using), and the property value includes an {{cssxref("anchor()")}} function, `left` positions the left edge of the positioned element relative to the position of the specified [`<anchor-side>`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/anchor#anchor-side) edge. The `left` property is [compatible](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/anchor#compatibility_of_inset_properties_and_anchor-side_values) with the `left`, `right`, `start`, `end`, `self-start`, `self-end`, `center`, and `<percentage>` values.
- When `position` is set to `relative`, the `left` property specifies the distance the element's left edge is moved to the right from its normal position.
- When `position` is set to `sticky`, the `left` property is used to compute the sticky-constraint rectangle.
- When `position` is set to `static`, the `left` property has _no effect_.

When both `left` and {{cssxref("right")}} are defined, and width constraints don't prevent it, the element will stretch to satisfy both. If the element cannot stretch to satisfy both, the position of the element is _overspecified_. When this is the case, the `left` value has precedence when the container is left-to-right; the `right` value has precedence when the container is right-to-left.

#### HTML

```html
<p>You can use percentages and lengths in so many places.</p>
```

#### CSS

```css
p {
  /* length-percentage examples */
  width: 75%;
  height: 200px;
  margin: 3rem;
  padding: 1%;
  border-radius: 10px 10%;
  font-size: 250%;
  line-height: 1.5em;

  /* length examples */
  text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px red;

  text-size-adjust: 20%;
}
```

#### Result

### Use in calc()

Where a `<length-percentage>` is specified as an allowable type, this means that the percentage resolves to a length and therefore can be used in a {{cssxref("calc", "calc()")}} expression. Therefore, all of the following values are acceptable for {{cssxref("width")}}:

```css example-good
width: 200px;
width: 20%;
width: calc(100% - 200px);
```

# <length>

The **`<length>`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [data type](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_and_units/CSS_data_types) represents a distance value. Lengths can be used in numerous CSS properties, such as {{Cssxref("width")}}, {{Cssxref("height")}}, {{Cssxref("margin")}}, {{Cssxref("padding")}}, {{Cssxref("border-width")}}, {{Cssxref("font-size")}}, and {{Cssxref("text-shadow")}}.

> [!NOTE]
> Although {{cssxref("&lt;percentage&gt;")}} values are usable in some of the same properties that accept `<length>` values, they are not themselves `<length>` values. See {{cssxref("&lt;length-percentage&gt;")}}.

## Syntax

The `<length>` data type consists of a {{cssxref("&lt;number&gt;")}} followed by one of the units listed below. As with all CSS dimensions, there is no space between the number and the unit literal. Specifying the length unit is optional if the number is `0`.

> [!NOTE]
> Some properties allow negative `<length>` values, while others do not.

The [specified value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Value_processing#specified_value) of a length (_specified length_) is represented by its quantity and unit. The [computed value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Value_processing#computed_value) of a length (_computed length_) is the specified length resolved to an absolute length, and its unit is not distinguished.

The `<length>` units can be relative or absolute. Relative lengths represent a measurement in terms of some other distance. Depending on the unit, this distance can be the size of a specific character, the [line height](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/line-height), or the size of the {{Glossary("viewport")}}. Style sheets that use relative length units can more easily scale from one output environment to another.

> [!NOTE]
> Child elements do not inherit the relative values as specified for their parent; they inherit the computed values.

## Relative length units

CSS relative length units are based on font, container, or viewport sizes.

### Relative length units based on font

Font lengths define the `<length>` value in terms of the size of a particular character or font attribute in the font currently in effect in an element or its parent.

> [!NOTE]
> These units, especially `em` and the root relative `rem`, are often used to create scalable layouts, which maintain the vertical rhythm of the page even when the user changes the font size.

- `cap`
  - : Represents the "cap height" (nominal height of capital letters) of the element's {{Cssxref("font")}}.
- `ch`
  - : Represents the width or, more precisely, the {{Glossary("advance measure")}} of the glyph `0` (zero, the Unicode character U+0030) in the element's {{Cssxref("font")}}.
    In cases where determining the measure of the `0` glyph is impossible or impractical, it must be assumed to be `0.5em` wide by `1em` tall.
- `em`
  - : Represents the calculated {{Cssxref("font-size")}} of the element. If used on the {{Cssxref("font-size")}} property itself, it represents the _inherited_ font-size of the element.
- `ex`
  - : Represents the [x-height](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-height) of the element's {{Cssxref("font")}}. In fonts with the `x` letter, this is generally the height of lowercase letters in the font; `1ex ≈ 0.5em` in many fonts.
- `ic`
  - : Equal to the used {{Glossary("advance measure")}} of the "水" glyph (CJK water ideograph, U+6C34), found in the font used to render it.
- `lh`
  - : Equal to the computed value of the {{Cssxref("line-height")}} property of the element on which it is used, converted to an absolute length. This unit enables length calculations based on the theoretical size of an ideal empty line. However, the size of actual line boxes may differ based on their content.

### Relative length units based on root element's font

Root element font relative length units define the `<length>` value in terms of the size of a particular character or font attribute of the [root](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root) element:

- `rcap`
  - : Equal to the "cap height" (nominal height of capital letters) of the root element's {{Cssxref("font")}}.
- `rch`
  - : Equal to the width or the {{Glossary("advance measure")}} of the glyph `0` (zero, the Unicode character U+0030) in the root element's {{Cssxref("font")}}.
- `rem`
  - : Represents the {{Cssxref("font-size")}} of the root element (typically {{HTMLElement("html")}}). When used within the root element {{Cssxref("font-size")}}, it represents its initial value. A common browser default is `16px`, but user-defined preferences may modify this.
- `rex`
  - : Represents the x-height of the root element's {{Cssxref("font")}}.
- `ric`
  - : Equal to the value of [`ic`](#ic) unit on the root element's font.
- `rlh`
  - : Equal to the value of [`lh`](#lh) unit on the root element's font. This unit enables length calculations based on the theoretical size of an ideal empty line. However, the size of actual line boxes may differ based on their content.

### Relative length units based on viewport

The **viewport-percentage length units** are based on four different viewport sizes: small, large, dynamic, and default. The allowance for the different viewport sizes is in response to browser interfaces expanding and retracting dynamically and hiding and showing the content underneath.

- **Small viewport units**
  - : When you want the smallest possible viewport in response to browser interfaces expanding dynamically, you should use the small viewport size. The small viewport size allows the content you design to fill the entire viewport when browser interfaces are expanded. Choosing this size might also possibly leave empty spaces when browser interfaces retract.

    For example, an element that is sized using viewport-percentage units based on the small viewport size, the element will fill the screen perfectly without any of its content being obscured when all the dynamic browser interfaces are shown. When those browser interfaces are hidden, however, there might be extra space visible around the element. Therefore, the small viewport-percentage units are "safer" to use in general, but might not produce the most attractive layout after a user starts interacting with the page.

    The small viewport size is represented by the `sv` prefix and results in the `sv*` viewport-percentage length units. The sizes of the small viewport-percentage units are fixed, and therefore stable, unless the viewport itself is resized.

- **Large viewport units**
  - : When you want the largest possible viewport in response to browser interfaces retracting dynamically, you should use the large viewport size. The large viewport size allows the content you design to fill the entire viewport when browser interfaces are retracting. You need to be aware that the content might get hidden when browser interfaces expand.

    For example, on mobile phones where screen real-estate is at a premium, browsers often hide part or all of the title and address bar after a user starts scrolling the page. When an element is sized using a viewport-percentage unit based on the large viewport size, the content of the element will fill the entire visible page when these browser interfaces are hidden. However, when these retractable browser interfaces are shown, they can hide the content that is sized or positioned using the _large_ viewport-percentage units.

    The large viewport unit is represented by the `lv` prefix and results in the `lv*` viewport-percentage units. The sizes of the large viewport-percentage units are fixed and therefore stable, unless the viewport itself is resized.

- **Dynamic viewport units**
  - : When you want the viewport to be automatically sized in response to browser interfaces dynamically expanding or retracting, you can use the dynamic viewport size. The dynamic viewport size allows the content you design to fit exactly within the viewport, irrespective of the presence of dynamic browser interfaces.

    The dynamic viewport unit is represented by the `dv` prefix and results in the `dv*` viewport-percentage units. The sizes of the dynamic viewport-percentage units are not stable, even when the viewport itself is unchanged.

    > [!NOTE]
    > While the dynamic viewport size can give you more control and flexibility, using viewport-percentage units based on the dynamic viewport size can cause the content to resize while a user is scrolling a page. This can lead to degradation of the user interface and cause a performance hit.

- **Default viewport units**
  - : The default viewport size is defined by the browser. The behavior of the resulting viewport-percentage unit could be equivalent to the viewport-percentage unit based on the small viewport size, the large viewport size, an intermediate size between the two, or the dynamic viewport size.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For example, a browser might implement the default viewport-percentage unit for height (`vh`) that is equivalent to the large viewport-percentage height unit (`lvh`). If so, this could obscure content on a full-page display while the browser interface is expanded. Currently, all default viewport units (`vh`, `vw`, etc.) are equivalent to their large viewport counterparts (`lvh`, `lvw`, etc.).

Viewport-percentage lengths define `<length>` values in percentage relative to the size of the initial [containing block](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Containing_block), which in turn is based on either the size of the {{Glossary("viewport")}} or the page area, i.e., the visible portion of the document. When the height or width of the initial containing block is changed, the elements that are sized based on them are scaled accordingly. There is a viewport-percentage length unit variant corresponding to each of the viewport sizes, as described below.

> [!NOTE]
> Viewport lengths are invalid in {{cssxref("@page")}} declaration blocks.

- `vh`
  - : Represents a percentage of the height of the viewport's initial [containing block](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Containing_block). `1vh` is 1% of the viewport height. For example, if the viewport height is `300px`, then a value of `70vh` on a property will be `210px`.

    The respective viewport-percentage units for small, large, and dynamic viewport sizes are `svh`, `lvh`, and `dvh`. `vh` is equivalent to `lvh`, representing the viewport-percentage length unit based on the large viewport size.

- `vw`
  - : Represents a percentage of the width of the viewport's initial [containing block](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Containing_block). `1vw` is 1% of the viewport width. For example, if the viewport width is `800px`, then a value of `50vw` on a property will be `400px`.

    For small, large, and dynamic viewport sizes, the respective viewport-percentage units are `svw`, `lvw`, and `dvw`.
    `vw` is equivalent to `lvw`, representing the viewport-percentage length unit based on the large viewport size.

- `vmax`
  - : Represents in percentage the largest of `vw` and `vh`.

    For small, large, and dynamic viewport sizes, the respective viewport-percentage units are `svmax`, `lvmax`, and `dvmax`.
    `vmax` is equivalent to `lvmax`, representing the viewport-percentage length unit based on the large viewport size.

- `vmin`
  - : Represents in percentage the smallest of `vw` and `vh`.

    For small, large, and dynamic viewport sizes, the respective viewport-percentage units are `svmin`, `lvmin`, and `dvmin`.
    `vmin` is equivalent to `lvmin`, representing the viewport-percentage length unit based on the large viewport size.

- `vb`
  - : Represents the percentage of the size of the initial [containing block](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Containing_block), in the direction of the root element's [block axis](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_logical_properties_and_values).

    For small, large, and dynamic viewport sizes, the respective viewport-percentage units are `svb`, `lvb`, and `dvb`, respectively.
    `vb` is equivalent to `lvb`, representing the viewport-percentage length unit based on the large viewport size.

- `vi`
  - : Represents a percentage of the size of the initial [containing block](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Containing_block), in the direction of the root element's [inline axis](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_logical_properties_and_values).

    For small, large, and dynamic viewport sizes, the respective viewport-percentage units are `svi`, `lvi`, and `dvi`.
    `vi` is equivalent to `lvi`, representing the viewport-percentage length unit based on the large viewport size.

### Container query length units

When applying styles to a container using container queries, you can use container query length units.
These units specify a length relative to the dimensions of a query container.
Components that use units of length relative to their container are more flexible to use in different containers without having to recalculate concrete length values.

If no eligible container is available for the query, the container query length unit defaults to the [small viewport unit](#small_viewport_units) for that axis (`sv*`).

For more information, see [Container queries](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_containment/Container_queries).

- `cqw`
  - : Represents a percentage of the width of the query container. `1cqw` is 1% of the query container's width. For example, if the query container's width is `800px`, then a value of `50cqw` on a property will be `400px`.

- `cqh`
  - : Represents a percentage of the height of the query container. `1cqh` is 1% of the query container's height. For example, if the query container's height is `300px`, then a value of `10cqh` on a property will be `30px`.

- `cqi`
  - : Represents a percentage of the inline size of the query container. `1cqi` is 1% of the query container's inline size. For example, if the query container's inline size is `800px`, then a value of `50cqi` on a property will be `400px`.

- `cqb`
  - : Represents a percentage of the block size of the query container. `1cqb` is 1% of the query container's block size. For example, if the query container's block size is `300px`, then a value of `10cqb` on a property will be `30px`.

- `cqmin`
  - : Represents a percentage of the smaller value of either the query container's inline size or block size. `1cqmin` is 1% of the smaller value of either the query container's inline size or block size. For example, if the query container's inline size is `800px` and its block size is `300px`, then a value of `50cqmin` on a property will be `150px`.

- `cqmax`
  - : Represents a percentage of the larger value of either the query container's inline size or block size. `1cqmax` is 1% of the larger value of either the query container's inline size or block size. For example, if the query container's inline size is `800px` and its block size is `300px`, then a value of `50cqmax` on a property will be `400px`.

## Absolute length units

**Absolute length units** represent a physical measurement when the physical properties of the output medium are known, such as for print layout. This is done by anchoring one of the units to a **physical unit** or the **visual angle unit** and then defining the others relative to it. Physical units include `cm`, `in`, `mm`, `pc`, `pt`, `px`, and `Q`.The anchoring is done differently for low-resolution devices, such as screens, versus high-resolution devices, such as printers.

For low-dpi devices, the unit `px` represents the physical _reference pixel_; other units are defined relative to it. Thus, `1in` is defined as `96px`, which equals `72pt`. The consequence of this definition is that on such devices, dimensions described in inches (`in`), centimeters (`cm`), or millimeters (`mm`) don't necessarily match the size of the physical unit with the same name.

For high-dpi devices, inches (`in`), centimeters (`cm`), and millimeters (`mm`) are the same as their physical counterparts. Therefore, the `px` unit is defined relative to them (1/96 of `1in`).

> [!NOTE]
> Many users increase their {{Glossary("user agent")}}'s default font size to make text more legible. Absolute lengths can cause accessibility problems because they are fixed and do not scale according to user settings. For this reason, prefer relative lengths (such as `em` or `rem`) when setting `font-size`.

- `px`
  - : One pixel. For screen displays, it traditionally represents one {{glossary("device pixel")}} (dot). However, for _printers_ and _high-resolution screens_, one CSS pixel implies multiple device pixels. `1px` = `1in / 96`.
- `cm`
  - : One centimeter. `1cm` = `96px / 2.54`.
- `mm`
  - : One millimeter. `1mm` = `1cm / 10`.
- `Q`
  - : One quarter of a millimeter. `1Q` = `1cm / 40`.
- `in`
  - : One inch. `1in` = `2.54cm` = `96px`.
- `pc`
  - : One pica. `1pc` = `12pt` = `1in / 6`.
- `pt`
  - : One point. `1pt` = `1in / 72`.

## Interpolation

When animated, values of the `<length>` data type are interpolated as real, floating-point numbers. The {{glossary("interpolation")}} happens on the calculated value. The speed of the interpolation is determined by the [easing function](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/easing-function) associated with the animation.

## Examples

### Comparing different length units

The following example provides you with an input field in which you can enter a `<length>` value (e.g., `300px`, `50%`, `30vw`) to set the width of a result bar that will appear below it once you've pressed the <kbd>Enter</kbd> or the <kbd>Return</kbd> key.

This allows you to compare and contrast the effects of different length units.

# letter-spacing

The **`letter-spacing`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets the horizontal spacing behavior between text characters. This value is added to the natural spacing between characters while rendering the text. Positive values of `letter-spacing` causes characters to spread farther apart, while negative values of `letter-spacing` bring characters closer together.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: letter-spacing")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
letter-spacing: normal;
```

```css interactive-example-choice

  font-family: "Amstelvar", serif;
}
```

## Syntax

/* Keyword value */
letter-spacing: normal;

/* <length> values */
letter-spacing: 0.3em;

letter-spacing: 0.3px;

/* Global values */
letter-spacing: inherit;
letter-spacing: initial;
letter-spacing: revert;
letter-spacing: revert-layer;
letter-spacing: unset;
```

### Values

- `normal`
  - : The normal letter spacing for the current font. Unlike a value of `0`, this keyword allows the {{glossary("user agent")}} to alter the space between characters in order to justify text.
- {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}}
  - : Specifies extra inter-character space _in addition to_ the default space between characters. Values may be negative, but there may be implementation-specific limits. User agents may not further increase or decrease the inter-character space in order to justify text.

## Accessibility

A large positive or negative `letter-spacing` value will make the word(s) the styling is applied to unreadable. For text styled with a very large positive value, the letters will be so far apart that the word(s) will appear like a series of individual, unconnected letters. For text styled with a very large negative value, the letters will overlap each other to the point where the word(s) may be unrecognizable.

Legible letter-spacing must be determined on a case-by-case basis, as different font families have different character widths. There is no one value that can ensure all font families automatically maintain their legibility.

## Internationalization concerns

Some written languages should not have any letter spacing applied. For instance, languages that use the Arabic script expect connected letters to remain visually connected, as in the following example. Applying letter spacing will lead the text to look broken.

### Defining the color of filter lighting

This example demonstrates the basic use case of `lighting-color`, and how the CSS `lighting-color` property takes precedence over the `lighting-color` attribute.

#### HTML

We have an SVG with two {{SVGElement("filter")}} elements, one with a `<feDiffuseLighting>` and one with a `<feSpecularLighting>` child. Each includes the SVG `lighting-color` attribute defining the lighting color as `red`. Both of these children have a {{SVGElement("fePointLight")}}, the required child that sets the light source. We included two {{SVGElement("rect")}} elements with a filter attribute; this is where the filters will be displayed.

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 420 120" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <filter id="flood1">
    <feDiffuseLighting lighting-color="red">
      <fePointLight x="75" y="30" z="10" />
    </feDiffuseLighting>
  </filter>
  <filter id="flood2">
    <feSpecularLighting specularExponent="5" lighting-color="red">
      <fePointLight x="225" y="75" z="5" />
    </feSpecularLighting>
  </filter>

  <rect id="r1" filter="url(#flood1)" />
  <rect id="r2" filter="url(#flood2)" />
</svg>
```

#### CSS

We define the size and position of our `<rect>` using the CSS {{cssxref("height")}}, {{cssxref("width")}}, {{cssxref("x")}}, and {{cssxref("y")}} properties. We also add a background image to the SVG to make any color alpha transparency more apparent:

```css
svg {
  background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(
    45deg,
    transparent 0 9px,
    #cccccc 0px 10px
  );
}

rect {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  x: 10px;
  y: 10px;
}

#r2 {
  x: 150px;
}
```

We then apply different lighting color values to the filter's child elements using the CSS `lighting-color` property. We use a named color and a 3-digit hexadecimal color, but we can use any valid CSS color syntax:

```css
feDiffuseLighting {
  lighting-color: blue;
}

feSpecularLighting {
  lighting-color: #ff0099;
}
```

#### Results

{{EmbedLiveSample("Defining the color of filter lighting", "300", "220")}}

The attributes defined the color of both light filters as `red`, but these values were overridden by the CSS `lighting-color` values.

# line-clamp

The **`line-clamp`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property allows limiting of the contents of a {{Glossary("block")}} to the specified number of lines.

> [!NOTE]
> For legacy support, the vendor-prefixed `-webkit-line-clamp` property only works in combination with the {{cssxref("display")}} property set to `-webkit-box` or `-webkit-inline-box` and the {{cssxref("box-orient", "-webkit-box-orient")}} property set to `vertical`. Despite these prefixed properties being deprecated, the co-dependency of these three properties is a fully specified behavior and will continue to be supported.

In most cases you will also want to set {{cssxref("overflow")}} to `hidden`, otherwise the contents won't be clipped but an ellipsis will still be shown after the specified number of lines.

When applied to anchor elements, the truncating can happen in the middle of the text, not necessarily at the end.

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword value */
line-clamp: none;

/* <integer> values */
line-clamp: 3;
line-clamp: 10;

/* Global values */
line-clamp: inherit;
line-clamp: initial;
line-clamp: revert;
line-clamp: revert-layer;
line-clamp: unset;
```

### Values

- `none`
  - : This value specifies that the content won't be clamped.
- {{cssxref("integer")}}
  - : This value specifies the number of lines after which the content will be clamped. It must be greater than 0.

# line-height-step

{{SeeCompatTable}}

The **`line-height-step`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets the step unit for line box heights. When the property is set, line box heights are rounded up to the closest multiple of the unit.

## Syntax

```css
/* Point values */
line-height-step: 18pt;

/* Global values */
line-height-step: inherit;
line-height-step: initial;
line-height-step: revert;
line-height-step: revert-layer;
line-height-step: unset;
```

The `line-height-step` property is specified as any one of the following:

- a `<length>`.

### Values

- `<length>`
  - : The specified {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}} is used in the calculation of the line box height step.

## Formal definition

{{cssinfo}}

## Formal syntax

{{csssyntax}}

## Examples

### Setting step unit for line box height

In the following example, the height of line box in each paragraph is rounded up to the step unit. The line box in `<h1>` does not fit into one step unit and thus occupies two, but it is still centered within the two step unit.

```css
:root {
  font-size: 12pt;
  --my-grid: 18pt;
  line-height-step: var(--my-grid);
}
h1 {
  font-size: 20pt;
  margin-top: calc(2 * var(--my-grid));
}
```

The result of these rules is shown below in the following screenshot:

# line-height

The **`line-height`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets the height of a line box in horizontal [writing modes](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/writing-mode#vertical-rl). In vertical writing modes, it sets the width of a line box. It's commonly used to set the distance between lines of text. On block-level elements in horizontal writing modes, it specifies the preferred height of line boxes within the element, and on non-[replaced](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Replaced_elements) inline elements, it specifies the height that is used to calculate line box height.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: line-height")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
line-height: normal;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
line-height: 2.5;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
line-height: 3em;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
line-height: 150%;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
line-height: 32px;
```

```html interactive-example
<section id="default-example">
  <div class="transition-all" id="example-element">
    Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western
    spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun.
  </div>
</section>
```

```css interactive-example
#example-element {
  font-family: "Georgia", serif;
  max-width: 200px;
}
```

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword value */
line-height: normal;

/* Unitless values: use this number multiplied
by the element's font size */
line-height: 3.5;

/* <length> values */
line-height: 3em;

/* <percentage> values */
line-height: 34%;

/* Global values */
line-height: inherit;
line-height: initial;
line-height: revert;
line-height: revert-layer;
line-height: unset;
```

The `line-height` property is specified as any one of the following:

- a `<number>`
- a `<length>`
- a `<percentage>`
- the keyword `normal`.

### Values

- `normal`
  - : Depends on the user agent. Desktop browsers (including Firefox) use a default value of roughly **`1.2`**, depending on the element's `font-family`.
- `<number>` (unitless)
  - : The used value is this unitless {{cssxref("&lt;number&gt;")}} multiplied by the element's own font size. The computed value is the same as the specified `<number>`. In most cases, **this is the preferred way** to set `line-height` and avoid unexpected results due to inheritance.
- `<length>`
  - : The specified {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}} is used in the calculation of the line box height. Values given in **em** units may produce unexpected results (see example below).
- `<percentage>`
  - : Relative to the font size of the element itself. The computed value is this {{cssxref("&lt;percentage&gt;")}} multiplied by the element's computed font size. **Percentage** values may produce unexpected results (see the second example below).

## Accessibility

Use a minimum value of `1.5` for `line-height` for main paragraph content. This will help people experiencing low vision conditions, as well as people with cognitive concerns such as Dyslexia. If the page is zoomed to increase the text size, using a unitless value ensures that the line height will scale proportionately.

[W3C Understanding WCAG 2.2](https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/#visual-presentation)

## Formal definition

{{cssinfo}}

## Formal syntax

{{csssyntax}}

## Examples

### Basic example

```css
/* All rules below have the same resultant line height */

/* number/unitless */
div {
  line-height: 1.2;
  font-size: 10pt;
}

/* length */
div {
  line-height: 1.2em;
  font-size: 10pt;
}

/* percentage */
div {
  line-height: 120%;
  font-size: 10pt;
}

/* font shorthand */
div {
  font:
    10pt/1.2 "Bitstream Charter",
    "Georgia",
    serif;
}
```

It is often more convenient to set `line-height` by using the {{cssxref("font")}} shorthand as shown above, but this requires the `font-family` property to be specified as well.

### Prefer unitless numbers for line-height values

This example shows why it is better to use {{cssxref("&lt;number&gt;")}} values instead of {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}} values. We will use two {{HTMLElement("div")}} elements. The first div, with the green border, uses a unitless `line-height` value. The second div, with the red border, uses a `line-height` value defined in `em`s.

#### HTML

```html
<div class="box green">
  <h1>Avoid unexpected results by using unitless line-height.</h1>
  Length and percentage line-heights have poor inheritance behavior.
</div>

<div class="box red">
  <h1>Avoid unexpected results by using unitless line-height.</h1>
  Length and percentage line-heights have poor inheritance behavior
</div>

<!-- The first <h1> line-height is calculated from its own font-size   (30px × 1.1) = 33px -->
<!-- The second <h1> line-height results from the red div's font-size  (15px × 1.1) = 16.5px, probably not what you want -->
```

#### CSS

```css
.green {
  line-height: 1.1;
  border: solid limegreen;
}

.red {
  line-height: 1.1em;
  border: solid red;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 30px;
}

.box {
  width: 18em;
  display: inline-block;
  vertical-align: top;
  font-size: 15px;
}
```

### Space between lines in vertical writing modes

The `line-height` property can be used to adjust space between vertical lines in vertical writing modes.

```html hidden
<div class="haiku">
  古池や蛙飛び込む水の音<br />
  ふるいけやかわずとびこむみずのおと<br />
  富士の風や扇にのせて江戸土産<br />

# <line-style>

The **`<line-style>`** {{glossary("enumerated")}} value type represents keyword values that define the style of a line, or the lack of a line. The `<line-style>` keyword values are used in the following longhand and shorthand [border](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_backgrounds_and_borders) and [column](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_multicol_layout) properties:

- {{cssxref("border")}}, {{cssxref("border-style")}}
- {{cssxref("border-block")}}, {{cssxref("border-block-style")}}
- {{cssxref("border-block-end")}}, {{cssxref("border-block-end-style")}}
- {{cssxref("border-block-start")}}, {{cssxref("border-block-start-style")}}
- {{cssxref("border-bottom")}}, {{cssxref("border-bottom-style")}}

- {{cssxref("border-top")}}, {{cssxref("border-top-style")}}
- {{cssxref("column-rule")}}, {{cssxref("column-rule-style")}}

## Syntax

### Values

The `<line-style>` enumerated type is specified using one of the values listed below:

- `none`
  - : Displays no line. The computed value of the line width is `0` even if a width value is specified. In the case of table cell and border collapsing, the `none` value has the _lowest_ priority. If any other conflicting border is set, it will be displayed. The `none` value is similar to `hidden`.
- `hidden`
  - : Displays no line. The computed width of the line is `0` even if a width value is specified. In the case of table cell and border collapsing, the `hidden` value has the _highest_ priority. If any other conflicting border is set, it won't be displayed. The `hidden` value is similar to `none`, but `hidden` is not a valid value for outline styles.
- `dotted`
  - : Displays a series of round dots. The radius of the dots is half the computed value of the line's width. The spacing of the dots is not defined by the specification and is implementation-specific.
- `dashed`
  - : Displays a series of short square-ended dashes or line segments. The exact size and length of the segments are not defined by the specification and are implementation-specific.
- `solid`
  - : Displays a single, straight solid line.
- `double`
  - : Displays two straight lines with some space between them. The length of the lines adds up to the pixel size defined by the line's width.
- `groove`
  - : Displays a border with a carved appearance. This value is the opposite of `ridge`.
- `ridge`
  - : Displays a border with an extruded appearance. This value is the opposite of `groove`.
- `inset`
  - : Displays a border that makes the element appear embedded. This value is the opposite of `outset`. When applied to a table cell border and {{cssxref("border-collapse")}} is set to `collapsed`, this value behaves like `groove`.
- `outset`
  - : Displays a border that makes the element appear embossed. This value is the opposite of `inset`. When applied to a table cell with {{cssxref("border-collapse")}} set to `collapsed`, this value behaves like `ridge`.

> [!NOTE]
> When `<outline-style>` is used as the value type for {{cssxref("outline")}} and {{cssxref("outline-style")}} properties, it is similar to `<line-style>`, but does not support `hidden` and includes the `auto` value. When `auto` is set, the user-agent defined `<line-style>` value is used.

## Formal syntax

{{CSSSyntaxRaw(`<line-style> = none | hidden | dotted | dashed | solid | double | groove | ridge | inset | outset`)}}

## Examples

The first example demonstrates all the `<line-style>` keyword values. The second example demonstrates how some line style colors may display in unexpected ways.

### Defining line styles

This example shows all the `<line-style>` values as values for the CSS {{cssxref("border-style")}} and {{cssxref("column-rule-style")}} properties.

#### HTML

This example uses multiple {{HTMLElement( "div" )}} elements, each with a class representing the `<line-style>` value that is being demonstrated.

```html
<div class="{line-style}">
  <p>{line-style}</p>
  <p>a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z</p>
</div>
```

```html hidden
<div class="none">
  <p>none</p>
  <p>a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z</p>
</div>
<div class="hidden">
  <p>hidden</p>
  <p>a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z</p>
</div>
<div class="dotted">

  <p>a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z</p>
</div>
<div class="double">
  <p>double</p>
  <p>a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z</p>
</div>
<div class="groove">

  <p>a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z</p>
</div>
<div class="inset">
  <p>inset</p>
  <p>a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z</p>
</div>
<div class="outset">
  <p>outset</p>
  <p>a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z</p>
</div>
```

#### CSS

In the CSS for this example, the border and the column-rule for all the `<p>` elements is defined to have a width of `7px` and the style value of `double`. For each paragraph, the `double` value is then overridden by specifying a different `<line-style>` value for the `border-style` and `column-rule-style` properties.

```css hidden
div {
  display: flex;
  gap: 1em;
  list-style: none;
  align-items: center;
}
div:first-of-type {
  display: none;
}

p:first-of-type {
  text-align: center;
  line-height: 5em;
}
p {
  width: 10em;
  height: 5em;
  background-color: palegoldenrod;
}
```

```css
p {
  padding: 5px;
  border: double 7px #bada55;
}
p + p {
  columns: 3;
  column-gap: 20px;
  column-rule: double 7px;
  border-color: black;
}
.none p {
  border-style: none;
  column-rule-style: none;
}
.hidden p {
  border-style: hidden;
  column-rule-style: hidden;
}
.dotted p {
  border-style: dotted;
  column-rule-style: dotted;
}
.dashed p {
  border-style: dashed;
  column-rule-style: dashed;
}
.solid p {
  border-style: solid;
  column-rule-style: solid;
}
.double p {
  border-style: double;
  column-rule-style: double;
}
.groove p {
  border-style: groove;
  column-rule-style: groove;
}
.ridge p {
  border-style: ridge;
  column-rule-style: ridge;
}
.inset p {
  border-style: inset;
  column-rule-style: inset;
}
.outset p {
  border-style: outset;
  column-rule-style: outset;
}
```

Notice that the black border is not always black.

### Defining line styles and colors

This example demonstrates line-style and color choice. With some `<line-style>` keyword values, the color of the line may not be what you expect. To create the required "3D" effect of `groove`, `ridge`, `inset`, and `outset` styles when displaying these values in black or white, user agents use different color calculations than any other color-line combinations.

#### CSS

The four sides of each `<div>` have a different `<line-style>` value, and each list item has a different {{cssxref("color_value", "&lt;color>")}} value. We use [generated content](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content) to display the CSS declared inline.

```css hidden live-sample___line_style_colors
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 1em;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  font-family: monospace;
}
```

```css live-sample___line_style_colors
div {
  border-width: 10px;
  border-style: inset groove ridge outset;
  padding: 5px;
}
```

#### JavaScript

The JavaScript dynamically creates {{HTMLElement( "div" )}} elements, each with a different `border-color` set.

```js live-sample___line_style_colors
// prettier-ignore
const colors = [
  "#000000", "#000001", "#ffffff",
  "#ff00ff", "#ffff00", "#00ffff",
  "#cc33cc", "#cccc33", "#33cccc",
  "#ff0000", "#00ff00", "#0000ff",
  "#cc3333", "#33cc33", "#3333cc",
  "#993333", "#339933", "#333399",
];

for (const c of colors) {
  const div = document.createElement("div");
  div.style.borderColor = c;
  div.textContent = c;
  document.body.appendChild(div);
}
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("line_style_colors", "500", "200")}}

Notice that the almost-black color of `#000001` may be different from the actual black, and the contrast between the dark and light edges is more noticeable when using lighter colors.

# list-style-position

The **`list-style-position`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets the position of the {{cssxref("::marker")}} relative to a list item.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: list-style-position")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
list-style-position: inside;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
list-style-position: outside;
```

```html interactive-example
<section class="default-example" id="default-example">
  <div>
    <p>NASA Notable Missions</p>
    <ul class="transition-all" id="example-element">
      <li>Apollo 11: First Human Landing</li>
      <li>City in Space: The International Space Station</li>
      <li>Great Observatory: The Hubble Space Telescope</li>
      <li>Everlasting Mars Rovers</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>
```

```css interactive-example
.default-example {
  font-size: 1.2rem;
}

#example-element {
  width: 100%;
  background: #be094b;
  color: white;
}

section {
  text-align: left;
  flex-direction: column;
}

hr {
  width: 50%;
  color: lightgray;
  margin: 0.5em;
}

.note {
  font-size: 0.8rem;
}

.note a {
  color: #009e5f;
}

@counter-style space-counter {
  symbols: "\1F680" "\1F6F8" "\1F6F0" "\1F52D";
  suffix: " ";
}
```

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword values */
list-style-position: inside;
list-style-position: outside;

/* Global values */
list-style-position: inherit;
list-style-position: initial;
list-style-position: revert;
list-style-position: revert-layer;
list-style-position: unset;
```

The `list-style-position` property is specified as one of the keyword values listed below.

### Values

- `inside`
  - : The {{cssxref("::marker")}} is the first element among the list item's contents.
- `outside`
  - : The {{cssxref("::marker")}} is outside the principal block box. This is the default value for {{cssxref("list-style")}}.

## Description

This property is applied to list items, i.e., elements with `{{cssxref("display")}}: list-item;`. [By default](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/rendering.html#lists) this includes {{HTMLElement("li")}} elements. Because this property is inherited, it can be set on the parent element (normally {{HTMLElement("ol")}} or {{HTMLElement("ul")}}) to let it apply to all list items.

If a block element is the first child of a list element declared as `list-style-position: inside`, then the block element is placed on the line after the marker-box.

It is often more convenient to use the shorthand {{cssxref("list-style")}}.

# list-style-type

The **`list-style-type`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets the marker (such as a disc, character, or custom counter style) of a list item element.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: list-style-type")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
list-style-type: space-counter;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
list-style-type: disc;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
list-style-type: circle;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
list-style-type: "\1F44D";
```

    <ul class="transition-all unhighlighted" id="example-element">
      <li>Apollo</li>
      <li>Hubble</li>

  <div class="note">

      <code>space-counter</code> is defined with
      <a
        href="//developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/@counter-style"
        target="_parent"
        ><code>@counter-style</code></a
      >
    </p>
  </div>
</section>
```

```css interactive-example
.default-example {
  font-size: 1.2rem;
}

#example-element {
  width: 100%;
  background: #be094b;
  color: white;
}

section {
  text-align: left;
  flex-direction: column;
}

hr {
  width: 50%;
  color: lightgray;
  margin: 0.5em;
}

.note {
  font-size: 0.8rem;
}

.note a {
  color: #009e5f;
}

@counter-style space-counter {
  symbols: "\1F680" "\1F6F8" "\1F6F0" "\1F52D";
  suffix: " ";
}
```

The marker will be [`currentColor`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#currentcolor_keyword), the same as the computed [color](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) of the element it applies to.

Only a few elements ({{HTMLElement("li")}} and {{HTMLElement("summary")}}) have a default value of `display: list-item`. However, the `list-style-type` property may be applied to any element whose {{cssxref("display")}} value is set to `list-item`. Moreover, because this property is inherited, it can be set on a parent element (commonly {{HTMLElement("ol")}} or {{HTMLElement("ul")}}) to make it apply to all list items.

## Syntax

```css
/* Partial list of types */
list-style-type: disc;
list-style-type: circle;
list-style-type: square;
list-style-type: decimal;
list-style-type: georgian;
list-style-type: trad-chinese-informal;
list-style-type: kannada;

/* <string> value */
list-style-type: "-";

/* Identifier matching an @counter-style rule */
list-style-type: custom-counter-style;

/* Keyword value */
list-style-type: none;

/* Global values */
list-style-type: inherit;
list-style-type: initial;
list-style-type: revert;
list-style-type: revert-layer;
list-style-type: unset;
```

The `list-style-type` property may be defined as any one of:

- a `<custom-ident>` value,
- a `symbols()` value,
- a `<string>` value, or
- the keyword `none`.

Note that:

- Some types require a suitable font installed to display as expected.
- The `cjk-ideographic` is identical to `trad-chinese-informal`; it exists for legacy reasons.

### Values

Refer to the [All list style types](#all_list_style_types) example to see the above values in action. Details of all the available counter styles used by various cultures around the world can be found in [Ready-made Counter Styles](https://w3c.github.io/predefined-counter-styles/).

### Non-standard extensions

A few predefined types are supported by Mozilla (Firefox) with a `-moz-` prefix.

- `ethiopic-halehame`: `-moz-ethiopic-halehame`
- `ethiopic-halehame-am`: `-moz-ethiopic-halehame-am`
- `ethiopic-halehame-ti-er`: `-moz-ethiopic-halehame-ti-er`
- `ethiopic-halehame-ti-et`: `-moz-ethiopic-halehame-ti-et`
- `ethiopic-numeric`: `-moz-ethiopic-numeric`
- `hangul`: `-moz-hangul`
- `hangul-consonant`: `-moz-hangul-consonant`
- `urdu`: `-moz-urdu`

See the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) to check which browsers support which extension.

## Accessibility

Safari will not recognize an ordered or unordered list as a list in the accessibility tree if it has a `list-style-type` value of `none`. This can be resolved by adding `role="list"` to the list's opening tag. To learn more about this and potential workarounds, see [`list-style`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style#accessibility).

# list-style

The **`list-style`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [shorthand property](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Shorthand_properties) allows you to set all the list style properties at once.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: list-style")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
list-style: square;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
list-style: inside;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
list-style: url("/shared-assets/images/examples/rocket.svg");
```

```css interactive-example-choice
list-style: none;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
list-style: georgian inside url("/shared-assets/images/examples/rocket.svg");
```

```css interactive-example-choice
list-style: georgian outside url("/non-existent.svg");
```

```html interactive-example
<section class="default-example" id="default-example">
  <div>
    <p>NASA Notable Missions</p>
    <ul class="transition-all" id="example-element">
      <li>Apollo</li>
      <li>Hubble</li>
      <li>Chandra</li>
      <li>Cassini-Huygens</li>
      <li>Spitzer</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>
```

```css interactive-example
.default-example {
  font-size: 1.2rem;
}

#example-element {
  width: 100%;
  background: #be094b;
  color: white;
}

section {
  text-align: left;
  flex-direction: column;
}

hr {
  width: 50%;
  color: lightgray;
  margin: 0.5em;
}

.note {
  font-size: 0.8rem;
}

.note a {
  color: #009e5f;
}

@counter-style space-counter {
  symbols: "\1F680" "\1F6F8" "\1F6F0" "\1F52D";
  suffix: " ";
}
```

The values of this property are applied to list items, including {{HTMLElement("li")}} elements and elements with `{{cssxref("display")}}: list-item;`. Because this property is inherited, it can be set on a parent element (normally {{HTMLElement("ol")}} or {{HTMLElement("ul")}}) to make the same list styling apply to all the nested items.

## Constituent properties

This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:

- [`list-style-image`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style-image)
- [`list-style-position`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style-position)
- [`list-style-type`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style-type)

## Syntax

```css
/* type */
list-style: square;

/* image */
list-style: url("../img/shape.png");

/* position */
list-style: inside;

/* two values */
list-style: georgian outside;
list-style: url("img/pip.svg") inside;

/* three values */
list-style: lower-roman url("img/shape.png") outside;

/* Keyword value */
list-style: none;

/* Global values */
list-style: inherit;
list-style: initial;
list-style: revert;
list-style: revert-layer;
list-style: unset;
```

The `list-style` property is specified as one, two, or three values in any order. If {{cssxref("list-style-type")}} and {{cssxref("list-style-image")}} are both set, the `list-style-type` is used as a fallback if the image is unavailable.

### Values

- {{cssxref("list-style-type")}}
  - : A `<counter-style>`, {{cssxref("string")}}, or `none`. If omitted in the shorthand, the default `disc` value is used. See {{cssxref("list-style-type")}}.
- {{cssxref("list-style-image")}}
  - : An {{cssxref("image")}} or `none`. If omitted, the default `none` value is used. See {{cssxref("list-style-image")}}.
- {{cssxref("list-style-position")}}
  - : Either `inside` or `outside`. If omitted, the default `outside` value is used. See {{cssxref("list-style-position")}}.
- `none`
  - : No list style is used.

## Accessibility

Safari does not recognize ordered or unordered lists as lists in the accessibility tree if they have a `list-style` value of `none`, unless the list is nested within the {{HTMLElement("nav")}} navigation element. This [behavior is intentional](https://webkit.org/b/170179#c1) and is not considered a bug.

To ensure lists are announced as lists, include [`role="list"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/list_role) to {{HTMLElement("ol")}} and {{HTMLElement("ul")}} elements, especially if the list is not nested in a `<nav>`. This restores list semantics without affecting the design:

```html
<ul role="list">
  <li>An item</li>
  <li>Another item</li>
</ul>
```

If an ARIA `role` is not an option for your code, CSS can be used instead. Adding non-empty [pseudo-content](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content) such as text or images before each list item can restore list semantics, but impacts the visual appearance. Safari determines if the added pseudo-content suffices as accessible content, restoring list semantics if so. Generally, Safari considers text and images as sufficient, which is why the `content: "+ ";` shown below works (but requires additional styling to not affect the design).

```css
ul {
  list-style: none;
}

ul li::before {
  content: "+ ";
}
```

A declaration of `content: "";` (an empty string) is ignored, as are `content` values that contain only spaces, such as `content: " ";`.

These CSS workarounds should only be used when an HTML solution is unavailable, and only after testing to ensure that they don't result in unexpected behaviors that may negatively impact user experience.

# log()

The **`log()`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [function](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_and_units/CSS_value_functions) is an exponential function that returns the logarithm of a number.

[Logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm) is the inverse of exponentiation. It is the number that a fixed base has to be raised to in order to yield the number passed as the first parameter.

In CSS, when a single parameter is passed, the natural logarithm `e`, or approximately `2.7182818`, is used, though the base can be set to any value with an optional second parameter.

## Syntax

```css
/* A <number> value */
width: calc(100px * log(7.389)); /* 200px */
width: calc(100px * log(8, 2)); /* 300px */
width: calc(100px * log(625, 5)); /* 400px */
```

### Parameters

The `log(value [, base]?)` function accepts two comma-separated values as its parameters.

- `value`
  - : A calculation which resolves to a {{cssxref("&lt;number&gt;")}} greater than or equal to 0. Representing the value to be taken the log of.

- `base`
  - : Optional. A calculation which resolves to a {{cssxref("&lt;number&gt;")}} greater than or equal to 0. Representing the base of the logarithm. If not defined, the default logarithmic base `e` is used.

### Return value

The logarithm of `value`, when `base` is defined.

The natural logarithm (base `e`) of `value`, when `base` is not defined.

## Formal syntax

{{CSSSyntax}}

## Examples

### Using the `log()` function on a logarithmic scale

This example illustrates how the `log()` function can be used to visualize data values by using a [logarithmic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_scale). The width of each bar in this example is relative to its data value on a logarithmic scale with base 10. On each element, its value is assigned to a [CSS custom property](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascading_variables/Using_CSS_custom_properties) named `--value`, which is then used by the `.bar` class to calculate its width.

#### HTML

```html
<div class="bar" style="--value: 50">50</div>
<div class="bar" style="--value: 100">100</div>
<div class="bar" style="--value: 500">500</div>
<div class="bar" style="--value: 10000">10,000</div>
<div class="bar" style="--value: 2000000">2,000,000</div>
```

#### CSS

```css
.bar {
  width: calc(log(var(--value), 10) * 2em);
}
```

```css hidden
.bar {
  height: 2em;
  background-color: tomato;
  color: white;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  margin: 0.25em 0;
}
```

# margin-block-end

The **`margin-block-end`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property defines the logical block end margin of an element, which maps to a physical margin depending on the element's writing mode, directionality, and text orientation.

# margin-bottom

The **`margin-bottom`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets the [margin area](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_box_model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model#margin_area) on the bottom of an element. A positive value places it farther from its neighbors, while a negative value places it closer.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: margin-bottom")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
margin-bottom: 1em;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
margin-bottom: 10%;
```

![The effect of the CSS margin-bottom property on the element box](margin-bottom.svg)

This property has no effect on _non-[replaced](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Replaced_elements)_ inline elements, such as {{HTMLElement("span")}} or {{HTMLElement("code")}}.

## Syntax

```css
/* <length> values */
margin-bottom: 10px; /* An absolute length */
margin-bottom: 1em; /* relative to the text size */
margin-bottom: 5%; /* relative to the nearest block container's width */
margin-bottom: anchor-size(width);
margin-bottom: calc(anchor-size(--my-anchor self-block, 20px) / 3);

/* Keyword values */
margin-bottom: auto;

/* Global values */
margin-bottom: inherit;
margin-bottom: initial;
margin-bottom: revert;
margin-bottom: revert-layer;
margin-bottom: unset;
```

The `margin-bottom` property is specified as the keyword `auto`, or a `<length>`, or a `<percentage>`. Its value can be positive, zero, or negative.

### Values

- {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}}
  - : The size of the margin as a fixed value.
    - For _anchor-positioned elements_, the {{cssxref("anchor-size()")}} function resolves to a {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}} value relative to the associated _anchor element_'s width or height (see [Setting element margin based on anchor size](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning/Using#setting_element_margin_based_on_anchor_size)).

- {{cssxref("&lt;percentage&gt;")}}
  - : The size of the margin as a percentage, relative to the inline size (_width_ in a horizontal language, defined by {{cssxref("writing-mode")}}) of the [containing block](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Containing_block).
- `auto`
  - : The browser selects a suitable value to use. See {{cssxref("margin")}}.

# margin-inline-end

The **`margin-inline-end`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property defines the logical inline end margin of an element, which maps to a physical margin depending on the element's writing mode, directionality, and text orientation. In other words, it corresponds to the {{cssxref("margin-top")}}, {{cssxref("margin-right")}}, {{cssxref("margin-bottom")}} or {{cssxref("margin-left")}} property depending on the values defined for {{cssxref("writing-mode")}}, {{cssxref("direction")}}, and {{cssxref("text-orientation")}}.

# margin-inline

The **`margin-inline`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [shorthand property](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Shorthand_properties) is a shorthand property that defines both the logical inline start and end margins of an element, which maps to physical margins depending on the element's writing mode, directionality, and text orientation.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: margin-inline")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
margin-inline: 5% 10%;
writing-mode: horizontal-tb;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
margin-inline: 10px 40px;

  </div>
</section>
```

```css interactive-example
#container {
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  display: flex;
  align-content: flex-start;
  justify-content: flex-start;
}

.col {
  width: 33.33%;
  border: solid #ce7777 10px;
  background-color: #2b3a55;
  color: white;
  flex-shrink: 0;
}

#example-element {
  border: solid 10px #ffbf00;
  background-color: #2b3a55;
  unicode-bidi: bidi-override;
}
```

## Constituent properties

This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:

- {{cssxref("margin-inline-start")}}
- {{cssxref("margin-inline-end")}}

## Syntax

```css
/* <length> values */
margin-inline: 10px 20px; /* An absolute length */
margin-inline: 1em 2em; /* relative to the text size */
margin-inline: 5% 2%; /* relative to the nearest block container's width */
margin-inline: 10px; /* sets both start and end values */
margin-inline: anchor-size(width);
margin-inline: calc(anchor-size(self-block) / 5) auto;

/* Keyword values */
margin-inline: auto;

/* Global values */
margin-inline: inherit;
margin-inline: initial;
margin-inline: revert;
margin-inline: revert-layer;
margin-inline: unset;
```

This property corresponds to the {{CSSxRef("margin-top")}} and {{CSSxRef("margin-bottom")}}, or the {{CSSxRef("margin-right")}} and {{CSSxRef("margin-left")}} properties, depending on the values defined for {{CSSxRef("writing-mode")}}, {{CSSxRef("direction")}}, and {{CSSxRef("text-orientation")}}.

The `margin-inline` property may be specified using one or two values.

- When **one** value is specified, it applies the same margin to **both start and end**.
- When **two** values are specified, the first margin applies to the **start**, the second to the **end**.

### Values

The `margin-inline` property takes the same values as the {{CSSxRef("margin", "", "#values")}} property.

# margin-left

The **`margin-left`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets the [margin area](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_box_model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model#margin_area) on the left side of an element. A positive value places it farther from its neighbors, while a negative value places it closer.

```css interactive-example-choice
margin-left: 1em;
```

```css interactive-example-choice

.col {
  width: 33.33%;
  border: solid #5b6dcd 10px;

#example-element {

}
```

The vertical margins of two adjacent boxes may fuse. This is called [_margin collapsing_](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_box_model/Mastering_margin_collapsing).

In the rare cases where width is overconstrained (i.e., when all of `width`, `margin-left`, `border`, `padding`, the content area, and `margin-right` are defined), `margin-left` is ignored, and will have the same calculated value as if the `auto` value was specified.

## Syntax

```css
/* <length> values */
margin-left: 10px; /* An absolute length */
margin-left: 1em; /* relative to the text size */
margin-left: 5%; /* relative to the nearest block container's width */
margin-left: anchor-size(self-inline);
margin-left: calc(anchor-size(--my-anchor width, 20px) / 4);

/* Keyword values */
margin-left: auto;

/* Global values */
margin-left: inherit;
margin-left: initial;
margin-left: revert;
margin-left: revert-layer;
margin-left: unset;
```

The `margin-left` property is specified as the keyword `auto`, or a `<length>`, or a `<percentage>`. Its value can be positive, zero, or negative.

### Values

- {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}}
  - : The size of the margin as a fixed value.
    - For _anchor-positioned elements_, the {{cssxref("anchor-size()")}} function resolves to a {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}} value relative to the associated _anchor element_'s width or height (see [Setting element margin based on anchor size](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning/Using#setting_element_margin_based_on_anchor_size)).

- {{cssxref("&lt;percentage&gt;")}}
  - : The size of the margin as a percentage, relative to the inline size (_width_ in a horizontal language, defined by {{cssxref("writing-mode")}}) of the [containing block](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Containing_block).
- `auto`
  - : The left margin receives a share of the unused horizontal space, as determined mainly by the layout mode that is used. If the values of `margin-left` and `margin-right` are both `auto`, the calculated space is evenly distributed. This table summarizes the different cases:

# margin-right

The **`margin-right`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets the [margin area](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_box_model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model#margin_area) on the right side of an element. A positive value places it farther from its neighbors, while a negative value places it closer.

```css interactive-example-choice
margin-right: 1em;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
margin-right: 10%;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
margin-right: 10px;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
margin-right: 0;
```

```html interactive-example
<section id="default-example">
  <div id="container">
    <div class="col"></div>
    <div class="col transition-all" id="example-element"></div>
    <div class="col"></div>
  </div>
</section>
```

```css interactive-example
#container {
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  display: flex;
  align-content: flex-start;
  justify-content: flex-start;
}

.col {
  width: 33.33%;
  border: solid #5b6dcd 10px;
  background-color: rgb(229 232 252 / 0.6);

}
```

The vertical margins of two adjacent boxes may fuse. This is called [_margin collapsing_](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_box_model/Mastering_margin_collapsing).

## Syntax

```css
/* <length> values */
margin-right: 20px; /* An absolute length */
margin-right: 1em; /* relative to the text size */
margin-right: 5%; /* relative to the nearest block container's width */
margin-right: anchor-size(self-block);
margin-right: calc(anchor-size(--my-anchor height, 20px) / 4);

/* Keyword values */
margin-right: auto;

/* Global values */
margin-right: inherit;
margin-right: initial;
margin-right: revert;
margin-right: revert-layer;
margin-right: unset;
```

The `margin-right` property is specified as the keyword `auto`, or a `<length>`, or a `<percentage>`. Its value can be positive, zero, or negative.

### Values

- {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}}
  - : The size of the margin as a fixed value.
    - For _anchor-positioned elements_, the {{cssxref("anchor-size()")}} function resolves to a {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}} value relative to the associated _anchor element_'s width or height (see [Setting element margin based on anchor size](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning/Using#setting_element_margin_based_on_anchor_size)).

- {{cssxref("&lt;percentage&gt;")}}
  - : The size of the margin as a percentage, relative to the inline size (_width_ in a horizontal language, defined by {{cssxref("writing-mode")}}) of the [containing block](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Containing_block).
- `auto`
  - : The right margin receives a share of the unused horizontal space, as determined mainly by the layout mode that is used. If the values of `margin-left` and `margin-right` are both `auto`, the calculated space is evenly distributed. This table summarizes the different cases:

# margin-top

The **`margin-top`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets the [margin area](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_box_model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model#margin_area) on the top of an element. A positive value places it farther from its neighbors, while a negative value places it closer.

# margin-trim

{{SeeCompatTable}}

The `margin-trim` property allows the container to trim the margins of its children where they adjoin the container's edges.

## Syntax

```css
margin-trim: none;
margin-trim: block;
margin-trim: block-start;
margin-trim: block-end;
margin-trim: inline;
margin-trim: inline-start;
margin-trim: inline-end;

/* Global values */
margin-trim: inherit;
margin-trim: initial;
margin-trim: revert;
margin-trim: revert-layer;
margin-trim: unset;
```

### Values

- `none`
  - : Margins are not trimmed by the container.

- `block`
  - : Margins provided to the block children where they adjoin the container's edges are trimmed to zero without affecting the margins provided to the container.

- `block-start`
  - : Margin of the first block child with the container's edge is trimmed to zero.

- `block-end`
  - : Margin of last block child with the container's edge is trimmed to zero.

- `inline`
  - : Margins provided to the inline children where they adjoin the container's edges are trimmed to zero, without affecting the spacing at the beginning and end of the row.

- `inline-start`
  - : Margin between the container's edge and the first inline child is trimmed to zero.

- `inline-end`
  - : Margin between the container's edge and the last inline child is trimmed to zero.

### Basic usage

Once support is implemented for this property, it will probably work like so:

When you've got a container with some inline children and you want to put a margin between each child but not have it interfere with the spacing at the end of the row, you might do something like this:

```css
article {
  background-color: red;
  margin: 20px;
  padding: 20px;
  display: inline-block;
}

article > span {
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 10px;
  margin-right: 20px;
  margin-left: 30px;
}
```

The problem here is that you'd end up with 20px too much spacing at the right of the row, so you'd maybe do this to fix it:

```css
span:last-child {
  margin-right: 0;
  margin-left: 0;
}
```

It is a pain having to write another rule to achieve this, and it is also not very flexible. Instead, `margin-trim` could fix it:

```css
article {
  margin-trim: inline-end;
  /* … */
}
```

Similarly, to remove left margin with the container's edge:

```css
article {
  margin-trim: inline-start;
  /* … */
}
```

# margin

The **`margin`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) shorthand property sets the [margin area](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_box_model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model#margin_area) on all four sides of an element.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: margin")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
margin: 1em;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
margin: 5% 0;
```

```css interactive-example-choice

```

  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  display: flex;
  align-content: flex-start;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: flex-start;
}

.row {
  height: 33.33%;
  display: inline-block;
  border: solid #ce7777 10px;
  background-color: #2b3a55;
  flex-shrink: 0;
}

#example-element {
  border: solid 10px #ffbf00;
  background-color: #2b3a55;
}
```

## Constituent properties

This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:

- {{cssxref("margin-top")}}
- {{cssxref("margin-right")}}
- {{cssxref("margin-bottom")}}
- {{cssxref("margin-left")}}

## Syntax

```css
/* apply to all four sides */
margin: 1em;
margin: -3px;

/* top and bottom | left and right */
margin: 5% auto;

/* top | left and right | bottom */
margin: 1em auto 2em;

/* top | right | bottom | left */
margin: 2px 1em 0 auto;

/* anchor-size() values */
margin: 5% anchor-size(width);
margin: calc(anchor-size(width) / 4) 1em 0
  anchor-size(--my-anchor self-inline, 50px);

/* Keyword values */
margin: auto;

/* Global values */
margin: inherit;
margin: initial;
margin: revert;
margin: revert-layer;
margin: unset;
```

The `margin` property may be specified using one, two, three, or four values. Each value is a {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}}, a {{cssxref("&lt;percentage&gt;")}}, or the keyword `auto`. Negative values draw the element closer to its neighbors than it would be by default.

- When **one** value is specified, it applies the same margin to **all four sides**.
- When **two** values are specified, the first margin applies to the **top and bottom**, the second to the **left and right**.
- When **three** values are specified, the first margin applies to the **top**, the second to the **right and left**, the third to the **bottom**.
- When **four** values are specified, the margins apply to the **top**, **right**, **bottom**, and **left** in that order (clockwise).

### Values

- {{cssxref("length")}}
  - : The size of the margin as a fixed value.
    - For _anchor-positioned elements_, the {{cssxref("anchor-size()")}} function resolves to a {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}} value relative to the associated _anchor element_'s width or height (see [Setting element margin based on anchor size](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning/Using#setting_element_margin_based_on_anchor_size)).

- {{cssxref("percentage")}}
  - : The size of the margin as a percentage, relative to the inline size (_width_ in a horizontal language, defined by {{cssxref("writing-mode")}}) of the [containing block](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Containing_block).
- `auto`
  - : The browser selects a suitable margin to use. For example, in certain cases this value can be used to center an element.

## Description

This property can be used to set a margin on all four sides of an element. Margins create extra space _around_ an element, unlike {{cssxref("padding")}}, which creates extra space _within_ an element.

The top and bottom margins have no effect on _non-[replaced](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Replaced_elements)_ inline elements, such as {{HTMLElement("span")}} or {{HTMLElement("code")}}.

### Horizontal centering

You can horizontally center an element within its parent by setting `margin: 0 auto;`.

A more common method to center an element horizontally is by setting `display: flex;` and [`justify-content: center;`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content) on a container, which [centers its flex item](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Aligning_items_in_a_flex_container) children.

### Margin collapsing

Elements' top and bottom margins are sometimes collapsed into a single margin that is equal to the larger of the two margins. See [Mastering margin collapsing](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_box_model/Mastering_margin_collapsing) for more information.

# marker-end

The **`marker-end`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property points to a marker that will be drawn on the last vertex of the element's path; that is, at its ending vertex. The marker must have been defined using an SVG {{SVGElement('marker')}} element, and can only be referenced with a {{cssxref("url_value", "&lt;url&gt;")}} value. The value of the CSS property overrides any values of the `marker-end` attribute in the SVG.

For many marker-supporting shapes, the first and last vertices are the same point: for example, the top left corner of a {{SVGElement('rect')}}. In such shapes, if both the first and last markers are defined, two markers will be drawn at that point, though they may not face the same direction.

> [!NOTE]
> The `marker-end` property will only have an effect for elements that can use SVG markers. See {{SVGAttr("marker-end")}} for a list.

## Syntax

```css
marker-end: none;
marker-end: url("markers.svg#arrow");

/* Global values */
marker-end: inherit;
marker-end: initial;
marker-end: revert;
marker-end: revert-layer;
marker-end: unset;
```

### Values

- `none`
  - : This means no marker will be drawn at the last vertex of the element's path.

- `<marker-ref>`
  - : A {{cssxref("url_value", "&lt;url&gt;")}} that refers to a marker defined by an SVG {{SVGElement('marker')}} element, to be drawn at the last vertex of the element's path. If the URL reference is invalid, no marker will be drawn at the path's last vertex.

# marker-mid

The **`marker-mid`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property points to a marker that will be drawn on the middle vertices of the element's path; that is, at each of its vertices between the start and end vertices. The marker must have been defined using an SVG {{SVGElement('marker')}} element, and can only be referenced with a {{cssxref("url_value", "&lt;url&gt;")}} value. The value of the CSS property overrides any values of the `marker-mid` attribute in the SVG.

The direction each marker points is defined as the direction halfway between the direction at the end of the preceding path segment and the direction of the start of the following path segment. This can be thought of as the cross product of the vectors defined by the two path directions.

> [!NOTE]
> The `marker-mid` property will only have an effect for elements that can use SVG markers. See {{SVGAttr("marker-mid")}} for a list.

## Syntax

```css
marker-mid: none;
marker-mid: url("markers.svg#arrow");

/* Global values */
marker-mid: inherit;
marker-mid: initial;
marker-mid: revert;
marker-mid: revert-layer;
marker-mid: unset;
```

### Values

- `none`
  - : This means no marker will be drawn at each middle vertex of the element's path.

- `<marker-ref>`
  - : A {{cssxref("url_value", "&lt;url&gt;")}} that refers to a marker defined by an SVG {{SVGElement('marker')}} element, to be drawn at each middle vertex of the element's path. If the URL reference is invalid, no marker will be drawn at the path's middle vertices.

# marker-start

The **`marker-start`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property points to a marker that will be drawn on the first vertex of the element's path; that is, at its starting vertex. The marker must have been defined using an SVG {{SVGElement('marker')}} element, and can only be referenced with a {{cssxref("url_value", "&lt;url&gt;")}} value. The value of the CSS property overrides any values of the `marker-start` attribute in the SVG.

For many marker-supporting shapes, the first and last vertices are in the same place: for example, the top left corner of a {{SVGElement('rect')}}. In such shapes, if both the first and last markers are defined, two markers will be drawn at that point, though they may not point in the same direction.

> [!NOTE]

# marker

The **`marker`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property points to a marker that will be drawn on the first, middle, and last vertices of the element's path; that is, at all of its vertices. The marker must have been defined using an SVG {{SVGElement('marker')}} element, and can only be referenced with a {{cssxref("url_value", "&lt;url&gt;")}} value. The value of the CSS property overrides any values of the `marker-start`, `marker`, and `marker-end` attributes in the SVG.

For many marker-supporting shapes, the first and last vertices are in the same place: for example, the top left corner of a {{SVGElement('rect')}}. In such shapes, if both the first and last markers are defined, two markers will be drawn at that point, though they may not point in the same direction.

For the middle vertices, the direction each marker points is defined as the direction halfway between the direction at the end of the preceding path segment and the direction of the start of the following path segment.

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword values */
mask-border-mode: luminance;
mask-border-mode: alpha;

/* Global values */
mask-border-mode: inherit;
mask-border-mode: initial;
mask-border-mode: revert;

# mask-border-outset

The **`mask-border-outset`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property specifies the distance by which an element's [mask border](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask-border) is set out from its border box.

## Syntax

```css
/* <length> value */
mask-border-outset: 1rem;

/* <number> value */
mask-border-outset: 1.5;

/* top and bottom | left and right */
mask-border-outset: 1 1.2;

/* top | left and right | bottom */
mask-border-outset: 30px 2 45px;

/* top | right | bottom | left */
mask-border-outset: 7px 12px 14px 5px;

/* Global values */
mask-border-outset: inherit;
mask-border-outset: initial;
mask-border-outset: revert;
mask-border-outset: revert-layer;
mask-border-outset: unset;
```

The `mask-border-outset` property may be specified as one, two, three, or four values. Each value is a {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}} or {{cssxref("&lt;number&gt;")}}. Negative values are invalid.

- When **one** value is specified, it applies the same outset to **all four sides**.
- When **two** values are specified, the first outset applies to the **top and bottom**, the second to the **left and right**.
- When **three** values are specified, the first outset applies to the **top**, the second to the **left and right**, the third to the **bottom**.
- When **four** values are specified, the outsets apply to the **top**, **right**, **bottom**, and **left** in that order (clockwise).

### Values

- {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}}
  - : The size of the mask border outset as a dimension.
- {{cssxref("&lt;number&gt;")}}
  - : The size of the mask border outset as a multiple of the corresponding {{cssxref("border-width")}}.

### Basic usage

This property doesn't appear to be supported anywhere yet. When it eventually starts to be supported, it will serve to move the mask away from the inner edge of the element's border box — you can use it to make the mask start from part way across the border, rather than the inside of it.

```css
mask-border-outset: 1rem;
```

Chromium-based browsers support an outdated version of this property — `mask-box-image-outset` — with a prefix:

```css
-webkit-mask-box-image-outset: 1rem;
```

# mask-border-repeat

The **`mask-border-repeat`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property specifies how the images for the sides and the middle part of the [mask border image](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask-border) are scaled and tiled.

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword value */
mask-border-repeat: stretch;
mask-border-repeat: repeat;
mask-border-repeat: round;
mask-border-repeat: space;

/* top and bottom | left and right */
mask-border-repeat: round stretch;

/* Global values */
mask-border-repeat: inherit;
mask-border-repeat: initial;
mask-border-repeat: revert;
mask-border-repeat: revert-layer;
mask-border-repeat: unset;
```

The `mask-border-repeat` property may be specified using one or two values chosen from the list of values below.

- When **one** value is specified, it applies the same behavior on **all four sides**.
- When **two** values are specified, the first applies to the **top and bottom**, the second to the **left and right**.

### Values

- `stretch`
  - : The source image's edge regions are stretched to fill the gap between each border.
- `repeat`
  - : The source image's edge regions are tiled (repeated) to fill the gap between each border. Tiles may be clipped to achieve the proper fit.
- `round`
  - : The source image's edge regions are tiled (repeated) to fill the gap between each border. Tiles may be stretched to achieve the proper fit.
- `space`
  - : The source image's edge regions are tiled (repeated) to fill the gap between each border. Extra space will be distributed in between tiles to achieve the proper fit.

### Basic usage

This property doesn't appear to be supported anywhere yet.

```css
mask-border-repeat: round;
```

Chromium-based browsers support an outdated version of this property — `mask-box-image-repeat` — with a prefix:

```css
-webkit-mask-box-image-repeat: round;

# mask-border-slice

The **`mask-border-slice`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property divides the image set by {{cssxref("mask-border-source")}} into regions. These regions are used to form the components of an element's [mask border](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask-border).

## Syntax

```css
/* All sides */
mask-border-slice: 30%;

/* top and bottom | left and right */
mask-border-slice: 10% 30%;

/* top | left and right | bottom */
mask-border-slice: 30 30% 45;

/* top | right | bottom | left */
mask-border-slice: 7 12 14 5;

/* Using the `fill` keyword */
mask-border-slice: 10% fill 7 12;

/* Global values */
mask-border-slice: inherit;
mask-border-slice: initial;
mask-border-slice: revert;
mask-border-slice: revert-layer;
mask-border-slice: unset;
```

The `mask-border-slice` property may be specified using one to four `<number-percentage>` values to represent the position of each image slice. Negative values are invalid; values greater than their corresponding dimension are clamped to `100%`.

- When **one** position is specified, it creates all four slices at the same distance from their respective sides.
- When **two** positions are specified, the first value creates slices measured from the **top and bottom**, the second creates slices measured from the **left and right**.
- When **three** positions are specified, the first value creates a slice measured from the **top**, the second creates slices measured from the **left and right**, the third creates a slice measured from the **bottom**.
- When **four** positions are specified, they create slices measured from the **top**, **right**, **bottom**, and **left** in that order (clockwise).

The optional `fill` value, if used, can be placed anywhere in the declaration.

### Values

- {{cssxref("&lt;number&gt;")}}
  - : Represents an edge offset in _pixels_ for raster images and _coordinates_ for vector images. For vector images, the number is relative to the element's size, not the size of the source image, so percentages are generally preferable in these cases.
- {{cssxref("&lt;percentage&gt;")}}
  - : Represents an edge offset as a percentage of the source image's size: the width of the image for horizontal offsets, the height for vertical offsets.
- `fill`
  - : Preserves the middle image region. Its width and height are sized to match the top and left image regions, respectively.

## Description

The slicing process creates nine regions in total: four corners, four edges, and a middle region. Four slice lines, set a given distance from their respective sides, control the size of the regions.

![The nine regions defined by the border-image or border-image-slice properties](border-image-slice.png)

The above diagram illustrates the location of each region.

- Zones 1-4 are corner regions. Each one is used a single time to form the corners of the final border image.
- Zones 5-8 are edge regions. These are [repeated, scaled, or otherwise modified](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask-border-repeat) in the final border image to match the dimensions of the element.
- Zone 9 is the middle region. It is discarded by default, but is used like a background image if the keyword `fill` is set.

The {{cssxref("mask-border-repeat")}}, {{cssxref("mask-border-width")}}, and {{cssxref("mask-border-outset")}} properties determine how these regions are used to form the final mask border.

### Basic usage

`mask-border-slice` serves to define the size of the slices taken from the source image, and is used to create the border mask.

```css

```

Chromium-based browsers support an outdated version of this property — `mask-box-image-slice` — with a prefix:

The {{cssxref("mask-border-slice")}} property is used to divide the source image into regions, which are then dynamically applied to the final mask border.

## Syntax

# mask-border-width

The **`mask-border-width`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets the width of an element's [mask border](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask-border).

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword value */
mask-border-width: auto;

/* <length> value */
mask-border-width: 1rem;

/* <percentage> value */
mask-border-width: 25%;

/* <number> value */
mask-border-width: 3;

/* top and bottom | left and right */
mask-border-width: 2em 3em;

/* top | left and right | bottom */
mask-border-width: 5% 15% 10%;

/* Global values */
mask-border-width: inherit;
mask-border-width: initial;
mask-border-width: revert;
mask-border-width: revert-layer;
mask-border-width: unset;
```

The `mask-border-width` property may be specified using one, two, three, or four values chosen from the list of values below.

- When **one** value is specified, it applies the same width to **all four sides**.
- When **two** values are specified, the first width applies to the **top and bottom**, the second to the **left and right**.
- When **three** values are specified, the first width applies to the **top**, the second to the **left and right**, the third to the **bottom**.
- When **four** values are specified, the widths apply to the **top**, **right**, **bottom**, and **left** in that order (clockwise).

### Values

- `<length-percentage>`
  - : The width of the mask border, specified as a {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}} or a {{cssxref("&lt;percentage&gt;")}}. Percentages are relative to the _width_ of the border area for horizontal offsets and the _height_ of the border area for vertical offsets. Must not be negative.
- `<number>`
  - : The width of the mask border, specified as a multiple of the corresponding {{cssxref("border-width")}}. Must not be negative.
- `auto`
  - : The width of the mask border is made equal to the intrinsic width or height (whichever is applicable) of the corresponding {{cssxref("mask-border-slice")}}. If the image does not have the required intrinsic dimension, the corresponding `border-width` is used instead.

## Formal definition

## Examples

### Basic usage

`mask-border-width` defines the width of the border mask — setting this to a different value to [`mask-border-slice`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask-border-slice) will cause the slices to be scaled to fit the border mask.

```css
/* Final mask scaled down to 20px wide */
mask-border-slice: 30 fill;
mask-border-width: 20px;
```

Chromium-based browsers support an outdated version of this property — `mask-box-image-width` — with a prefix:

## Examples

### Setting a bitmap-based mask border

In this example, we will mask an element's border with a diamond pattern. The source for the mask is a ".png" file of 90 by 90 pixels, with three diamonds going vertically and horizontally:

<img src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/mask-border-diamonds.png" alt="The image used for the mask examples on this page. The mask is a transparent square with three rows of three diamonds each. The diamonds are a very light, almost white, shade of grey. The middle part between the diamonds is also solid grey. The parts between the outside of the diamonds and the edge of the image are transparent." loading="lazy" style="background-color: black;">

To match the size of a single diamond, we will use a value of 90 divided by 3, or `30`, for slicing the image into corner and edge regions. A repeat value of `round` will make the mask slices fit evenly, i.e., without clipping or gaps.

```html live-sample___mask-border-example
<div class="masked">
  This element is surrounded by a bitmap-based mask border! Pretty neat, isn't
  it?
</div>
```

```css-nolint live-sample___mask-border-example
.masked {
  width: 200px;
  background-color: lavender;
  border: 18px solid salmon;
  padding: 10px;

  -webkit-mask-box-image: url("https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/mask-border-diamonds.png")
    30 fill /          /* slice */
    20px /             /* width */
    1px                /* outset */
    round;             /* repeat */

  mask-border:
    url("https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/mask-border-diamonds.png")
    30 fill /        /* slice */
    20px /           /* width */
    1px              /* outset */
    round;           /* repeat */
}
```

# mask-clip

The **`mask-clip`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property determines the area which is affected by a mask. The painted content of an element must be restricted to this area.

## Syntax

```css
/* <coord-box> values */
mask-clip: content-box;
mask-clip: padding-box;
mask-clip: border-box;
mask-clip: fill-box;
mask-clip: stroke-box;
mask-clip: view-box;

/* Keyword values */
mask-clip: no-clip;

/* Multiple values */
mask-clip: padding-box, no-clip;
mask-clip: view-box, fill-box, border-box;

/* Global values */
mask-clip: inherit;
mask-clip: initial;
mask-clip: revert;
mask-clip: revert-layer;
mask-clip: unset;
```

### Values

The property accepts a comma-separated list of keyword values. Each value is a `<coord-box>` or `no-clip`:

- `content-box`
  - : The painted content is clipped to the content box.
- `padding-box`
  - : The painted content is clipped to the padding box.
- `border-box`
  - : The painted content is clipped to the border box.
- `fill-box`
  - : The painted content is clipped to the object bounding box.
- `stroke-box`
  - : The painted content is clipped to the stroke bounding box.
- `view-box`
  - : Uses the nearest SVG viewport as reference box. If a [`viewBox`](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/viewBox) attribute is specified for the element creating the SVG viewport, the reference box is positioned at the origin of the coordinate system established by the `viewBox` attribute and the dimension of the reference box is set to the width and height values of the `viewBox` attribute.
- `no-clip`
  - : The painted content is not clipped.
- `border`
  - : This keyword behaves the same as `border-box`.
- `padding`
  - : This keyword behaves the same as `padding-box`.
- `content`
  - : This keyword behaves the same as `content-box`.
- `text`
  - : This keyword clips the mask image to the text of the element.

## Description

The `mask-clip` property defines the area of the element that is affected by the applied mask.

For mask layer images that do not reference an SVG {{svgelement("mask")}} element, the `mask-clip` property defines the mask painting area, or the area affected by the mask. The painted content of the element will be restricted to this area.

The `mask-clip` property has no affect on a mask layer image that references a `<mask>` element. The `<mask>` element's {{svgAttr("x")}}, {{svgAttr("y")}}, {{svgAttr("width")}}, {{svgAttr("height")}}, and {{svgAttr("maskUnits")}} attributes determine the mask painting area when the source of the {{cssxref("mask-image")}} is a `<mask>`.

An element can have multiple mask layers applied. The number of layers is determined by the number of comma-separated values in the `mask-image` property value (even if a value is `none`). Each `mask-clip` value in the comma-separated list of values is matched up with the `mask-image` values, in order. If the number of values in the two properties differs, any excess values of `mask-clip` are not used, or, if `mask-clip` has fewer values than `mask-image`, the `mask-clip` values are repeated.

## Examples

### Clipping a mask to the border box

This examples demonstrates three `mask-clip` values.

#### HTML

We include three elements, each with a different `<coord-box>` value as a class name.

```html live-sample___mask-clip-example
<div class="border-box"></div>
<div class="padding-box"></div>
<div class="content-box"></div>
```

#### CSS

The CSS defines the element to have a background, border, padding, and margin, along with a mask image, with each `<div>` having a different `<coord-box>`. We generated content with the name of the class, moving that text up 10px to prevent it from being masked out of view.

```css live-sample___mask-clip-example
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: #8cffa0;
  margin: 10px;
  border: 20px solid #8ca0ff;
  padding: 20px;
  mask-image: url("https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/mdn.svg");
  mask-size: 100% 100%;
}
.content-box {
  mask-clip: content-box;
}
.border-box {
  mask-clip: border-box;
}
.padding-box {
  mask-clip: padding-box;
}
div::before {
  content: attr(class);
  position: relative;
  top: -10px;
}
```

```css hidden live-sample___mask-clip-example
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: row wrap;
}
```

# mask-composite

The **`mask-composite`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property represents a compositing operation used on the current mask layer with the mask layers below it.

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword values */
mask-composite: add;
mask-composite: subtract;
mask-composite: intersect;
mask-composite: exclude;

/* Global values */
mask-composite: inherit;
mask-composite: initial;
mask-composite: revert;
mask-composite: revert-layer;
mask-composite: unset;
```

### Values

The property accepts a comma-separated list of `<compositing-operator>` keyword values, each representing a Porter-Duff compositing operator which defines the compositing operation used on the current mask layer with the mask layers below it, including:

- `add`
  - : The associated mask image is placed over all mask layers below it (with the corresponding compositing operators applied). This is the default value.
- `subtract`
  - : The associated mask image is placed, where it falls outside of all mask layers below it (with the corresponding compositing operators applied).
- `intersect`
  - : The parts of the associated mask image that overlap all composited mask layers below it replace those previously composited layers.
- `exclude`
  - : The non-overlapping regions of the associated mask image and the mask layers below it, with their corresponding compositing operators applied, are combined.

## Description

When an element has multiple mask layers applied, the `mask-composite` property can be used to define how the multiple masks interact with each other, or are combined, in creating the final mask effect.

The number of layers is determined by the number of comma-separated values in the `mask-image` property value (even if a value is `none`). Each `mask-composite` value in the comma-separated list of values is matched up with a `mask-image` value, in order. If the number of values in `mask-composite` are equal to or greater than the number of `mask-image` values, the extra values are ignored. If the `mask-composite` property doesn't have enough comma-separated values to match the number of layers, the list of values are repeated until there are enough.

For processing, the _source layer_, which is current or associated mask layer image, is either added to (the default), subtracted from, intersected with, or is excluded from, the destination layers. The _destination layers_ are the mask layers below the source with their corresponding compositing operators applied; this includes all the previous layers, composed in order of appearance within the comma-separated list of masks. All mask layers below the current mask layer must be composited before applying the compositing operation for the current mask layer. Mask layer images are transformed to alpha masks for processing before being combined by the defined compositing value.

The multiple mask layers applied to any element or pseudo-element act as if they are rendered into an isolated group. In other words, the mask layers are composited with other mask layers, not with the element's content or the content behind the element.

## Examples

### Basic usage

This example demonstrates the basic usage of the `mask-composite` property.

#### HTML

We include an HTML {{htmlelement("div")}} element, that we will then style.

```html
<div></div>
```

#### CSS

We provide size and color our `<div>`, then add two {{cssxref("mask-image")}}s, and make their size match that of the element they're masking with the {{cssxref("mask-size")}} property. Lastly, we subtract the second mask image from the first mask image with the `mask-composite` property set to `subtract`.

```css
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;

  mask-image:
    url("https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/mdn.svg"),
    url("https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/mask-star.svg");
  mask-size: 100% 100%;

  mask-composite: subtract;
}
```

#### Results

{{EmbedLiveSample("basic usage", "", "150px")}}

### Value comparison

This example demonstrates the `mask-composite` property's four `<compositing-operator>` keyword values, along with comparing the effects of [`alpha` and `luminance`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask-type) mask modes.

#### HTML

We have a {{htmlelement("table")}} that contains eight images. The `<table>` has been hidden for brevity.

```html hidden
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="4">mask-type: alpha</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>

      </td>
      <td>
        <img
          src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/progress-pride-flag.jpg"

      </td>
      <td>
        <img
          src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/progress-pride-flag.jpg"
          alt="Pride flag" />
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

```html
<img
  src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/progress-pride-flag.jpg"
  alt="Pride flag" />
```

And an SVG with 4 masks; an alpha heart and circle and a luminance heart and circle. The heart masks are defined using solid colors. The circle masks are created using semi-transparent white and black {{SVGAttr("stroke")}} and {{SVGAttr("fill")}} colors.

```html
<svg height="0" width="0">
  <mask id="heartAlpha" class="alpha">
    <path
      d="M20,70 A40,40,0,0,1,100,70 A40,40,0,0,1,180,70 Q180,130,100,190 Q20,130,20,70 Z"
      fill="green"
      stroke="white"
      stroke-width="20" />
  </mask>
  <mask id="circleAlpha" class="alpha">
    <circle
      cx="130"
      cy="130"
      r="50"
      fill="rgb(0 0 0 / 0.5)"
      stroke="rgb(255 255 255 / 0.5)"
      stroke-width="20" />
  </mask>
  <mask id="heartLuminance" class="luminance">
    <path
      d="M20,70 A40,40,0,0,1,100,70 A40,40,0,0,1,180,70 Q180,130,100,190 Q20,130,20,70 Z"
      fill="green"
      stroke="white"
      stroke-width="20" />
  </mask>
  <mask id="circleLuminance" class="luminance">
    <circle
      cx="130"
      cy="130"
      r="50"
      fill="rgb(0 0 0 / 0.5)"
      stroke="rgb(255 255 255 / 0.5)"
      stroke-width="20" />
  </mask>
</svg>
```

#### CSS

First we style the `<mask>` elements, providing each mask with a {{cssxref("mask-type")}} property value of either `alpha` or `luminance`.

```css
mask.luminance {
  mask-type: luminance;
}

mask.alpha {
  mask-type: alpha;
}
```

We then apply the heart and circle masks as the comma-separated {{cssxref("mask-image")}} property values. These are applied to each {{htmlelement("img")}} element, with all the images in a row getting the same masks.

```css
/* apply the mask images */
tr.alphaMaskType img {
  mask-image: url("#heartAlpha"), url("#circleAlpha");
}

tr.luminanceMaskType img {
  mask-image: url("#heartLuminance"), url("#circleLuminance");
}
```

Finally, we compose the masks using the `mask-composite` property, applying the four different enumerated `mask-composite` values by table column.

```css
/* property we're testing */
td:nth-of-type(1) img {
  mask-composite: add;
}
td:nth-of-type(2) img {
  mask-composite: subtract;
}
td:nth-of-type(3) img {
  mask-composite: intersect;
}
td:nth-of-type(4) img {
  mask-composite: exclude;
}
```

The table styles have been hidden for the sake of brevity.

```css hidden
mask {
  height: 50%;
}

table,
td,
th {
  border: 1px solid;
}
th {
  font-family: monospace;
}
th {
  color: green;
}
body > img {
  display: none;
}
```

# mask-image

The **`mask-image`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets the image that is used as the mask layer for an element, hiding sections of the element on which the masking image is set based on the alpha channel of the mask image and, depending on the {{cssxref("mask-mode")}} property value, the luminance of the mask image's colors.

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword value */
mask-image: none;

/* <mask-source> value */
mask-image: url("masks.svg#mask1");

/* <image> values */
mask-image: linear-gradient(black, transparent);
mask-image: image(url("mask.png"), skyblue);

/* Multiple values */
mask-image: url("mask.png"), linear-gradient(black 25%, transparent 35%);

/* Global values */
mask-image: inherit;
mask-image: initial;
mask-image: revert;
mask-image: revert-layer;
mask-image: unset;
```

### Values

- `none`
  - : This keyword is interpreted as a transparent black image layer.

- `<mask-source>`
  - : A {{cssxref("url_value", "&lt;url&gt;")}} reference to a {{SVGElement("mask")}} or to a CSS image.

- {{cssxref("&lt;image&gt;")}}
  - : An image value used as a mask image layer.

## Description

The `mask-image` property provides a mask that hides part of the element to which it is applied. The value is a comma-separated list of mask references. Each mask reference is an `<image>`, a `<mask-source>`, or the keyword `none`.

An `<image>` can be any type of image, including generated images such as [CSS gradients](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient).

If only one value is specified in the `mask-image` property value, and that value is `none`, no masking effect will be apparent. If multiple values are specified, a `none` value included in the list may have no direct effect, however, other `mask-*` values in the same list position will apply to a transparent black mask layer and have no visual effect.

Only image sources served over HTTP and HTTPS protocols are accepted as `<image>` values due to the [CORS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS) policy. Images served locally, including relative or absolute `file://` protocols, are not accepted, and will render as transparent black. To test URL image sources locally, [set up a local server](/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Tutorials/CycleTracker/Secure_connection#localhost).

A mask will be counted as a transparent black image layer, not revealing anything, in the following cases:

- The mask image is empty (zero width or zero height).
- The mask image fails to download.
- The browser does not support the mask image format.
- The mask image doesn't exist.
- The mask value doesn't point to a mask image.

The default value of the {{cssxref("mask-mode")}} property is `match-source`, which means the mode is defined by the mode of the mask image itself. The mask image's mode is generally `alpha` except when the mask source is an SVG {{svgelement("mask")}} element, in which case the mode is `luminance` unless the mode is changed to `alpha` via the CSS {{cssxref("mask-type")}} property or SVG {{svgattr("mask-type")}} attribute.

The `mask-mode` value is significant, because it determines whether the masking effect depends on the image source's alpha channel values alone or a combination of those and the mask's luminance (the lightness/darkness of the colors that make up the `mask-image`):

- In all cases, the alpha transparency of the mask matters; element areas masked by opaque sections of the `mask-image` will be rendered, while areas masked by transparent image sections are hidden.
- When the `mask-mode` value is set or resolves to `alpha`, only the alpha-channel of the colors matter; the hue, lightness, etc., don't matter.
- If the `mask-mode` property is set or defaults to `luminance`, the masking value is the luminance value of each color multiplied by its alpha value. The `mask-mode` will resolve to `luminance` if explicitly set to that value, or if the property is set to `match-source` and the `mask-image` source is an SVG {{svgelement("mask")}} that does not have its {{cssxref("mask-type")}} property or {{svgattr("mask-type")}} attribute explicitly set to `alpha`.

## Examples

### Gradient as a mask image

In this example, we use an `<image>` value as a mask, defining a CSS [radial gradient](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/radial-gradient) as our mask image to create a round image with a soft edge.

#### HTML

We include an HTML {{htmlelement("img")}} element, which will also be used in all other examples.

```html live-sample___example-image live-sample___first-example
<img
  src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/progress-pride-flag.jpg"
  alt="Pride flag" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("example-image", "100%", 250)}}

#### CSS

We use the CSS {{CSSxRef("gradient/radial-gradient")}} function to create a mask that has a black circle with a radius that is half the width of the mask, before transitioning to being transparent over 10%.

```css live-sample___first-example
img {
  mask-image: radial-gradient(black 50%, transparent 60%);
}
```

#### Results

{{EmbedLiveSample("first-example", "100%", 250)}}

The part of the original element that is masked by the black circle is fully opaque, fading to transparent as the mask fades to transparent.

### Image resource as a mask image

In this example, the `<mask-source>` used as our mask image is an external SVG.

#### HTML

We include the same image as the previous example. We've also included the image we will be using as the mask; a star whose {{cssxref("fill-opacity")}} is `0.5`, or 50% opaque.

```html
<img
  src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/progress-pride-flag.jpg"
  alt="Pride flag" />

<img
  src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/mask-star.svg"
  alt="A star" />
```

#### CSS

We use `mask-star.svg` as a mask image on our first image:

```css
img:first-of-type {
  mask-image: url("https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/mask-star.svg");
}
```

#### Results

{{EmbedLiveSample("Image resource as a mask image", "100%", 250)}}

The mask is semi-opaque, which is why the colors are not as vibrant as the previous example. The part of the image that is visible is 50% opaque; the opacity of the mask applied.
The mask is smaller than the image, so repeats by default. We could have used {{cssxref("mask-repeat")}} to control the repeating or {{cssxref("mask-size")}} to change the size of the mask, which we do in the next example.

### Multiple masks

This example demonstrates applying multiple masks.

```html hidden
<img
  src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/progress-pride-flag.jpg"
  alt="Pride flag" />
```

#### CSS

We apply two masks — the same semi-transparent SVG as in the previous example, and a {{CSSxRef("gradient/repeating-radial-gradient")}}. We control the size of the masks using the {{cssxref("mask-size")}} property. Because our first mask is not sized at 100%, we make sure our masks are centered and don't repeat with the {{cssxref("mask-position")}} and {{cssxref("mask-repeat")}} properties, respectively.

```css
img {
  mask-size: 95%, 100%;
  mask-position: center;
  mask-repeat: no-repeat;
  mask-image:
    url("https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/mask-star.svg"),
    repeating-radial-gradient(transparent 0 5px, black 5px 10px);
}
```

#### Results

{{EmbedLiveSample("multiple masks", "100%", 250)}}

### Masking with SVG `<mask>`

This example demonstrates using SVG {{svgelement("mask")}} elements as masks. In this case, the color of the mask matters as the {{cssxref("mask-type")}} value for SVG masks defaults to `luminance`, which means white opaque areas (100% luminance) will be masked and visible, transparent and black areas (0% luminance) will be clipped, and anything in between will be partially masked.

#### HTML

We've included an `id` for each of our four images, and an SVG that contains an equal number of `<mask>` elements.

```html
<img
  id="green"
  src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/progress-pride-flag.jpg"
  alt="Pride flag" />
<img
  id="stroke"
  src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/progress-pride-flag.jpg"
  alt="Pride flag" />
<img
  id="both"
  src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/progress-pride-flag.jpg"
  alt="Pride flag" />
<img
  id="alphaMode"
  src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/progress-pride-flag.jpg"
  alt="Pride flag" />

<svg height="0" width="0">
  <mask id="greenMask">
    <path
      d="M20,70 A40,40,0,0,1,100,70 A40,40,0,0,1,180,70 Q180,130,100,190 Q20,130,20,70 Z"
      fill="green" />
  </mask>
  <mask id="strokeMask">
    <path
      d="M20,70 A40,40,0,0,1,100,70 A40,40,0,0,1,180,70 Q180,130,100,190 Q20,130,20,70 Z"
      fill="none"
      stroke="white"
      stroke-width="20" />
  </mask>
  <mask id="bothMask">
    <path
      d="M20,70 A40,40,0,0,1,100,70 A40,40,0,0,1,180,70 Q180,130,100,190 Q20,130,20,70 Z"
      fill="green"
      stroke="white"
      stroke-width="20" />
  </mask>
  <mask id="black">
    <path
      d="M20,70 A40,40,0,0,1,100,70 A40,40,0,0,1,180,70 Q180,130,100,190 Q20,130,20,70 Z"
      fill="black" />
  </mask>
</svg>
```

```html hidden
<p>
  <label>
    <input type="checkbox" />
    Set the <code>mask-mode</code> to <code>alpha</code>.
  </label>
</p>
```

#### CSS

We apply a different `<mask>` to each `<img>`. No part of the last image, with the `black` fill, will be visible by default. In this case, while all colors used in this example are fully opaque, the `mask-mode` defaults to `match-type`, which resolves to `luminance` in this case.

```css
#green {
  mask-image: url("#greenMask");
}
#stroke {
  mask-image: url("#strokeMask");
}
#both {
  mask-image: url("#bothMask");
}
#alphaMode {
  mask-image: url("#black");
}

body:has(:checked) img {
  mask-mode: alpha;
}
```

The luminance values of `black`, `white`, and `green` are `0`, `100`, and [`46.228`](https://www.colorhexa.com/008000), respectively. This means the areas where the mask is white will be visible, whereas areas where the mask is black or fully transparent will be clipped (not visible). Areas where the mask is green will be visible but lighter, equivalent to having a white mask that is 46.228% opaque.

#### Results

{{EmbedLiveSample("SVG elements as masks", "100%", 540)}}

Toggle the checkbox to toggle the value of the `mask-mode` between `alpha` (checked) and the initial value, which resolves to `luminance` (unchecked). When `alpha` is used, the color of the mask doesn't matter; all that matters is the alpha-transparency. When the value resolves to `luminance`, `white` areas are visible, `black` areas are not, and `green` areas are visible but at an opacity that matches the luminance of the color `green`. When `mask-mode` is set to `alpha`, the colors are equivalent as they are all fully opaque.

# mask-mode

The **`mask-mode`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property is set on the element being masked. It sets whether the mask reference defined by the {{cssxref("mask-image")}} is treated as a luminance or alpha mask.

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword values */
mask-mode: alpha;
mask-mode: luminance;
mask-mode: match-source;

/* Multiple values */
mask-mode: alpha, match-source;

/* Global values */
mask-mode: inherit;
mask-mode: initial;
mask-mode: revert;
mask-mode: revert-layer;
mask-mode: unset;
```

### Values

The `mask-mode` property can take multiple comma-separated `<masking-mode>` keyword values, including:

- `alpha`
  - : Indicates that the alpha (transparency) values of the mask image should be used.

- `luminance`
  - : Indicates that the [luminance (brightness)](#understanding_luminance) values of the mask image should be used.

- `match-source`
  - : Indicates that the type of mask is determined by the source. This is the default property value.
    - If the {{cssxref("mask-image")}} references an SVG {{svgelement("mask")}}, its {{cssxref("mask-type")}} property value is used, or it's {{SVGAttr("mask-type")}} attribute, if present. If neither is explicitly set, this value defaults to `luminance`.
    - If the mask image source is an {{cssxref("image")}} or a {{cssxref("gradient")}}, the `alpha` values of the mask image are used.

## Description

A mask transfers its transparency, and depending on the mask type, it's luminance, to the element it is masking.
If the mask is of type {{cssxref("&lt;image&gt;")}}, by default the alpha values of the mask image determine the visibility of each part of the masked element: where the mask is opaque, the corresponding part of the masked element is visible; where the mask is translucent, the element is as well, with those areas of the element being hidden. This is the default behavior for `<image>` masks when the `mask-mode` property is set to or defaults to `match-source`, and it is always the case when the `mask-mode` is explicitly set to `alpha`.

### Understanding luminance

In the case of `luminance` masks, the visibility of the masked element depends on both the opacity of the mask and the lightness of the color of the opaque areas. White (100% luminance) opaque areas (alpha = 1) will be masked and visible, and black areas (0% luminance) transparent (alpha = 0) will be clipped. Areas with colors in between white and black and with partial opacity will be partially masked, reflecting the luminance and alpha transparency of each color making up the mask.

The opacity of a `luminance` mask is determined by the `R`, `G`, `B`, and `A` values of an `rgb()` color using the formula:

`((0.2125 * R) + (0.7154 * G) + (0.0721 * B)) * A`

For example, the color `green` is `#008000` or `rgb(0% 50% 0% / 1)`. In a `luminance` mask, any area masked by a solid `green` mask will be `35.77%` opaque. If the `mask-mode` for this mask is set to `alpha`, since `green` is a fully opaque color, the masked area will be `100%` opaque.

### Multiple values

Each `mask-mode` value is a comma-separated list of values. When multiple values are present, each value corresponds to a mask layer in the same position in the {{cssxref("mask-image")}} property. The values define whether the associated mask images are treated as a `luminance` or an `alpha` mask.

### Understanding `match-source`

In the case of `match-source`, whether `luminance` or `alpha` is used depends on the mask mode of the mask source. If the `mask-image` property values is a reference to an SVG {{svgelement("mask")}} element, the `<mask>` element's {{cssxref("mask-type")}} property value is used. If there is no CSS `mask-type` property set on the `<mask>` element, the value of the `<mask>` element's {{svgattr("mask-type")}} attribute is used, if present and supported. If neither is explicitly set, this value defaults to `luminance`; but only in the case of the `<mask>` element as the mask source. Otherwise, as noted before, if the mask image source is an {{cssxref("image")}}, rather than an SVG `<mask>`, the `alpha` values of the mask layer image is used.

### Usage and values

This example demonstrates the basic usage and different values of the `mask-mode` property.

#### HTML

We include three `<div>` elements, so we can demonstrate the three enumerated `mask-mode` keyword values.

```html
<div class="alpha">ALPHA</div>
<div class="luminance">LUMINANCE</div>
<div class="matchSource">MATCH-SOURCE</div>
```

#### CSS

Each `<div>` is provided with the same background and masking image. The only difference between each `<div>` is the value of the `mask-mode` property:

```css
div {
  background: blue linear-gradient(red, blue);
  mask-image: url("https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/mdn.svg");
}

.alpha {
  mask-mode: alpha;
}

.luminance {
  mask-mode: luminance;
}

.matchSource {
  mask-mode: match-source;
}
```

```css hidden
div {
  width: 227px;
  height: 200px;
  float: left;
  text-align: center;
  line-height: 65px;
  color: white;
  text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px black;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
```

#### Results

{{EmbedLiveSample("Usage and values", "", "250px")}}

Because the mask source is an `<image>` and not an SVG `<mask>`, the `match-source` value resolves to `alpha`.

# mask-origin

The **`mask-origin`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets the origin of a mask. This property determines the mask positioning area: the area within which a mask image is positioned. HTML elements can have masks contained within their content border box, padding box, or content box, whereas SVG elements (which don't have the associated CSS layout boxes) can have masks contained inside their fill, stroke, or view box.
For elements rendered as multiple boxes, such as a {{htmlelement("span")}} of text that spans more than one line, the `mask-origin` property specifies which boxes the {{cssxref("box-decoration-break")}} property operates on to determine the mask positioning area.

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword values */
mask-origin: content-box;
mask-origin: padding-box;
mask-origin: border-box;
mask-origin: fill-box;
mask-origin: stroke-box;
mask-origin: view-box;

/* Multiple values */
mask-origin: padding-box, content-box;
mask-origin: view-box, fill-box, border-box;

/* Global values */
mask-origin: inherit;
mask-origin: initial;
mask-origin: revert;
mask-origin: revert-layer;
mask-origin: unset;
```

### Values

The `mask-origin` property is a comma-separated list of `<coord-box>` keyword values, including:

- `content-box`
  - : The position is relative to the [content box](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_shapes/From_box_values#content-box).
- `padding-box`
  - : The position is relative to the [padding box](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_shapes/From_box_values#padding-box).
- `border-box`
  - : The position is relative to the [border box](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_shapes/From_box_values#border-box).
- `fill-box`
  - : The position is relative to the object bounding box.
- `stroke-box`
  - : The position is relative to the stroke bounding box.
- `view-box`
  - : Uses the nearest SVG viewport as reference box. If a {{svgattr("viewBox")}} attribute is specified for the element creating the SVG viewport, the reference box is positioned at the origin of the coordinate system established by the `viewBox` attribute and the dimension of the reference box is set to the width and height values of the `viewBox` attribute.

There are three non-standard values that are shortcuts for standard `<coord-box>` values: `content` is an alias for `content-box`, `padding` is an alias for `padding-box`, and `border` is an alias for `border-box`.

## Description

The `mask-origin` property is very similar to the {{cssxref("background-origin")}} property, but it has a different set of values and a different initial value. The initial value depends on the if there is an associated CSS layout box; if yes, the default value is `border-box`. In comparison, the default for `background-origin` is `padding-box`.

For SVG elements without an associated CSS layout box, the values `content-box`, `padding-box`, and `border-box` (the default value) compute to `fill-box`, meaning the position is relative to the object bounding box. For HTML elements, if a SVG-related value of `fill-box`, `stroke-box`, or `view-box` is set, the value is computed to `border-box`.

An element can have multiple mask layers applied. The number of layers is determined by the number of comma-separated values in the {{cssxref("mask-image")}} property value (even if one or more of those values is `none`). Each `mask-origin` value in the comma-separated list of values is matched with a comma-separated `mask-image` value, in the same order.

If the number of values in the two properties differs, any excess values of `mask-origin` are not used in cases where `mask-origin` has more values than `mask-image`. If `mask-origin` has fewer values than `mask-image`, the `mask-origin` values are repeated.

For elements rendered as a single box, this property specifies the mask positioning area — or the origin position — of the image referenced by the `mask-image` property.

For elements rendered as multiple boxes, such as inline boxes that span more than one line, the `mask-origin` property specifies which boxes the {{cssxref("box-decoration-break")}} property operates upon to determine the mask positioning area.

The `mask-origin` can cause the mask layer image to be clipped. For example, if the {{cssxref("mask-clip")}} property is set to `padding-box`, the `mask-origin` is set to `border-box`, the {{cssxref("mask-position")}} is set to the `top left` edge, and the element has a border, then the mask layer image will be clipped at the top-left edge.

### Comparing content, padding, and border

This example demonstrates basic usage while comparing three values of the `mask-origin` property.

#### HTML

We include four {{htmlelement("section")}} elements, each containing one {{htmlelement("div")}} element.

```html
<section class="content">
  <div></div>
</section>
<section class="padding">
  <div></div>
</section>
<section class="border">
  <div></div>
</section>
<section class="comparison">
  <div></div>
</section>
```

#### CSS

We apply {{cssxref("border")}}, {{cssxref("padding")}}, and {{cssxref("margin")}} to every `<div>`. These create the reference points for the mask image origin. The `border` shorthand includes a {{cssxref("border-color")}}. We also include a {{cssxref("background-color")}}. These provide a green background and a blue border to mask. Finally, all our `<div>` elements are provided with a {{cssxref("mask-image")}}.

```css
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  margin: 10px;
  border: 10px solid blue;
  background-color: #8cffa0;
  padding: 10px;
  mask-image: url("https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/mask-star.svg");
}
section {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```

We give each `<div>` a different `mask-origin` value.

```css
.content div {
  mask-origin: content-box;
}

.padding div {
  mask-origin: padding-box;
}

.border div {
  mask-origin: border-box;
}

.comparison div {
  mask-image: none;
}
```

We also generate some text inside each `<section>` to indicate the mask origin for each `<div>` container.

```css
section::before {
  content: attr(class);
  display: block;
  text-align: center;
}
```

```css hidden
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: row wrap;
  gap: 10px;
}
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Comparing content padding and border", "", "200")}}

Notice the difference between the three values. In the first three boxes, respectively, the mask originates from:

- The outside edge of the border.
- The inside border edge, which is the outer edge of the padding box.
- The inside padding edge, which is the outer edge of the content box.

The fourth box has no `mask-image` specified: it is a reference image, included to allow you to easily visualize the extent of the content and padding areas.

### Multiple values

This example demonstrates using different `mask-origin` values for different `mask-image`s applied to a single element.

#### HTML

We include a single `<div>`.

```html
<div></div>
```

#### CSS

We apply three mask images instead of one, each with a different {{cssxref("mask-position")}}. We also set the mask images not to repeat.

```css
div {
  width: 120px;
  height: 120px;
  margin: 10px;
  border: 10px solid blue;
  background-color: #8cffa0;
  padding: 10px;
  mask-image:
    url("https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/mask-star.svg"),
    url("https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/mask-star.svg"),
    url("https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/mask-star.svg");
  mask-position:
    top left,
    top right,
    bottom center;
  mask-repeat: no-repeat;
  mask-origin: content-box, border-box;
}
```

#### Results

{{EmbedLiveSample("Multiple values", "", "200")}}

We have three `mask-image` values, but only two `mask-origin` values. This means the `mask-origin` values are repeated, as if we had set `mask-origin: content-box, padding-box, content-box;`. The `border-box` star, the only mask overlapping the border, is the top-right star.

# mask-position

The **`mask-position`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets the initial position, relative to the mask position layer set by {{cssxref("mask-origin")}}, for each defined mask image.

## Syntax

```css
/* Single <position> keyword value */
/* Sets second value to 'center' */
mask-position: left;
mask-position: center;
mask-position: right;
mask-position: top;
mask-position: bottom;

/* Two <position> keyword values */
mask-position: left center;
mask-position: right top;

/* One length or percentage <position> value */
/* Horizontal position. Vertical position set to 'center' */
mask-position: 25%;
mask-position: 0px;
mask-position: 8em;

/* Two length or percentage <position> values */
/* First value: horizontal position. Second value: vertical position */
mask-position: 25% 75%;
mask-position: 0px 0px;
mask-position: 10% 8em;

/* Edge offsets: Four <position> values */
mask-position: bottom 10px right 20px;
mask-position: right 3em bottom 10px;
mask-position: bottom 10px right 0;

/* Multiple <position> values */
mask-position:
  top left,
  bottom 10px right 10px;
mask-position:
  1rem 1rem,
  center;

/* Global values */
mask-position: inherit;
mask-position: initial;
mask-position: revert;
mask-position: revert-layer;
mask-position: unset;
```

### Values

One or more `<position>` values, separated by commas.

- {{cssxref("&lt;position&gt;")}}
  - : One, two, or four values representing a 2D position specifying the edges of the element's box. Relative or absolute offsets can be given.

## Description

The `mask-position` property defines the position of each mask layer. An element can have multiple mask layers applied. The number of layers is determined by the number of comma-separated values in the {{cssxref("mask-image")}} property value (even `none` values create a layer).

Each `mask-position` value in the comma-separated list of values is matched up with an associated mask layer as defined by the list of `mask-image` values, in order. If the number of values in the two properties differs:

- If `mask-position` has more values than mask-image, the excess values of `mask-position` are not used.
- If `mask-position` has fewer values than mask-image, the `mask-position` values are repeated.

Each `mask-position` defines the associated mask layer's position relative to the associated {{cssxref("mask-origin")}} value. The `mask-origin` property values are similarly matched up with the `mask-image` values, in order, with excess `mask-position` values being unused or `mask-position` values being repeated if they are fewer in number than the `mask-origin` values. Each mask layer, therefore, has an associated `mask-origin` and `mask-position` value.

If no `mask-origin` is set, the value defaults to `padding-box`, meaning the origin of each `mask-position` is the element's [padding-box](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-edge#padding-box).

### One-value syntax

If only one `mask-position` value is specified, the second value is assumed to be `center`. If the value is a `<length>` or `<percentage>`, it defines the position of the mask along the horizontal axis, with the mask being vertically centered within the origin box. For example, `mask-position: 0%;` is equal to `mask-position: 0% center`.

If you use a single keyword for positioning, the other value will resolve to `center`. The default of `mask-position` is `0% 0%`, which equates to `mask-position: top left`. However:

- `mask-position: top;` is equivalent to `mask-position: top center;`.
- `mask-position: left;` is equivalent to `mask-position: center left`.
- `mask-position: center;` is equal to `mask-position: center center`.

If the value is a {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}} value, it represents the horizontal position as an offset from the left edge of the mask positioning. A positive value represents an offset inward from the left edge of the box container. The position can be set outside of the element's box using a negative value — this creates an outward offset that places the item outside the container's left edge.

#### Percentage values

A {{cssxref("&lt;percentage&gt;")}} value represents the mask's horizontal position value relative to the width of the container, positioned relative to the left edge. However, the offset is not from the mask edge to the box edge. Instead, the mask image dimension is [subtracted from the container's dimension](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position#regarding_percentages), and then a percentage of the resulting value is used as the direct offset from the box's left edge, which is the same as [percentage values for `background-position`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position#regarding_percentages).

The equation is:

`(container dimension - mask dimension) * position percentage = dimension offset value`

Given a `100px`-wide mask and a `1000px`-wide origin box, setting `mask-position: 10%;` (the equivalent of `10% 50%`) results in the mask being vertically centered at `90px` from the left edge. The equation is `(1000 - 100) * 10% = 90`. If the left offset had been `0%`, the mask's left edge would be flush to the left of the container (`(1000 - 100) * 0% = 0`).

If the left offset had been `100%`, the mask's right edge would be flush to the right of the container as the left edge of the `100px` wide mask would be `900px` (`(1000 - 100) * 100% = 900`) from the left edge of the container (the `100px` mask width plus `900px` distance from the left edge means the right edge would be `1000px` from the left edge, which is the right edge of the container).

### Two-value syntax

A two-value `<position>` specifies the position of the mask image inside its mask positioning area, with length and percentage values specifying offsets from the `left` and `top` of the area.

If the two values are {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}} values, {{cssxref("&lt;percentage&gt;")}} values, or the keyword `center`, the first value represents the horizontal position as an offset from the left edge of the mask positioning area, and the second value represents the vertical position as an offset from it's top edge, with [percentages being offset](#percentage_values) by the mask's size in that dimension.

In addition, if {{cssxref("&lt;percentage&gt;")}} values are specified, the first value is also the horizontal position value relative to the left edge, and the second value is also the vertical position value relative to the top edge.

A pair of axis-specific keywords can be reordered, as can an axis-specific keyword and a length or percentage, but two length or percentage values are not interchangeable.
If one of the two values is `top`, `right`, `bottom`, or `left`, the order of the two values doesn't matter. Any `center` or `<length-percentage>` value in the pair of values will be applied to the other dimension.

### Four-value syntax

The four-value syntax consists of two pairs of values, each pair containing a keyword specifying the edge to offset from, and a `<length>` and `<percentage>` value specifying the offset distance. For example, `mask-position: left 1em top 2em` specifies a `1em` horizontal offset from the left box edge and a `2em` vertical offset from the top edge. The two-value equivalent would be `mask-position: 1em 2em`.

Because we're defining the offset edges when using the four-value syntax, the order isn't important: `mask-position: top 2em left 1em` and `mask-position: left 1em top 2em` both produce the same result.

The real power of the four-value syntax is that it allows us to specify offset edges other than `left` and `top`. For example, `mask-position:  bottom 10px right 20px` creates a `10px` vertical offset up from the bottom edge and a `20px` horizontal offset leftward from the right edge. Usually, the four-value syntax is used to offset from the bottom and/or right. But this syntax is also helpful if you can't remember the offset edge order for the two-value syntax.

One thing to note is that, unlike the `<bg-position>` data type values for {{cssxref("background-position")}}, the `<position>` values for `mask-position` do not allow for a 3-value syntax and do not allow offsetting from `center`. When offsetting the mask from the `bottom` or `right`, the `mask-position` requires all four values to be declared.

For the four-value syntax to be valid, it needs to specify either `top` or `bottom` as the vertical offset edge, along with the vertical length or percentage offset value, and either `left` or `right` as the horizontal offset edge, along with the horizontal length or percentage offset value.

# mask-repeat

The **`mask-repeat`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets how mask images are repeated. A mask image can be repeated along the horizontal axis, the vertical axis, both axes, or not repeated at all.

## Syntax

```css
/* One-value syntax */
mask-repeat: repeat-x;
mask-repeat: repeat-y;
mask-repeat: repeat;
mask-repeat: space;
mask-repeat: round;
mask-repeat: no-repeat;

/* Two-value syntax: horizontal | vertical */
mask-repeat: repeat space;
mask-repeat: repeat repeat;
mask-repeat: round space;
mask-repeat: no-repeat round;

/* Multiple values */
mask-repeat:
  space round,
  no-repeat;
mask-repeat:
  round repeat,
  space,
  repeat-x;

/* Global values */
mask-repeat: inherit;
mask-repeat: initial;
mask-repeat: revert;
mask-repeat: revert-layer;
mask-repeat: unset;
```

### Values

The `mask-repeat` property is a comma-separated list of two `<repeat-style>` values,
with the first `<repeat-style>` value being the horizontal repetition value and the second value the vertical repetition value, or one keyword value that is a shorthand for two `<repeat-style>` values.

#### `<repeat-style>` values

The `<repeat-style>` values include:

- `repeat`
  - : The image is repeated as much as needed to cover the whole mask painting area. Mask images along the edges are clipped when the size of the [mask origin box](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask-origin) is not an exact multiple of the mask image's size.

- `space`
  - : The mask image is repeated as many times as possible without clipping. If the element's origin size is at least twice the size as the mask image's size in the associated dimension, the {{cssxref("mask-position")}} property is ignored and the first and last images are positioned at the edges of the mask origin container. If the mask origin box is not an exact multiple of the mask image's size, whitespace is distributed evenly between the repeated mask images.

    If the origin box size is less than twice the mask image's size in the given dimension, only one mask image can be displayed. In this case, the image is positioned as defined by the `mask-position` property, which defaults to `0% 0%`. The mask image will only be clipped if the mask image is larger than the mask origin box.

- `round`
  - : The mask image is repeated as many times as possible in its original dimensions. If the size of the mask origin box is not an exact multiple of the mask image's size, all mask images will be rescaled, [shrinking or stretching](#rounded_repetitions) to ensure no repetitions are clipped.

- `no-repeat`
  - : The mask image is not repeated (and hence the mask painting area will not necessarily be entirely covered). The position of the non-repeated mask image is defined by the {{cssxref("mask-position")}} CSS property.

#### Shorthand values

The one-value syntax is a shorthand for the full two-value syntax:

<table class="standard-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Single value</th>
      <th>Two-value equivalent</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>repeat-x</code></td>
      <td><code>repeat no-repeat</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>repeat-y</code></td>
      <td><code>no-repeat repeat</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>repeat</code></td>
      <td><code>repeat repeat</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>space</code></td>
      <td><code>space space</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>round</code></td>
      <td><code>round round</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>no-repeat</code></td>
      <td><code>no-repeat no-repeat</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

- `repeat-x`
  - : The equivalent of `repeat no-repeat`. The image is repeated in the horizontal direction as many times as needed to cover the width of the mask painting area. Mask images along the right or left edges, or both depending on the {{cssxref("mask-position")}} value, will be clipped if the width of the mask origin box is not an exact multiple of the mask image's width.

- `repeat-y`
  - : The equivalent of `no-repeat repeat`. The image is repeated in the vertical direction as many times as needed to cover the height of the mask painting area. Mask images along the top or bottom edges, or both depending on the {{cssxref("mask-position")}} value, will be clipped if the height of the mask origin box is not an exact multiple of the mask image's height.

## Description

The `mask-repeat` property accepts a comma-separated pair of values or one [shorthand value](#shorthand_values). In the two-value syntax, the first value represents the horizontal repetition behavior and the second value represents the vertical behavior.

### Multiple values

Each `mask-repeat` value in this comma-separated list applies to a separate mask layer. An element can have multiple mask layers applied. The number of layers is determined by the number of comma-separated values in the {{cssxref("mask-image")}} property value (even if a value is `none`). Each `mask-repeat` value is matched up with the `mask-image` values, in order. If the number of values in the two properties differs, any excess values of `mask-repeat` values are ignored, or, if `mask-repeat` has fewer values than `mask-image`, the `mask-repeat` values are repeated.

### Sizing and positioning

The `mask-repeat` property value defines how mask images are tiled after they have been [sized](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask-size) and [positioned](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask-position). The first (and possibly only) mask-image repetition is positioned by the {{cssxref("mask-position")}} property, which defaults to `0% 0%`, the top-left corner of the origin box. The size is defined by the {{cssxref("mask-size")}} property, which defaults to `auto`. The positions of the repeated masks are based on this initial mask instance.

### Clipping

Mask images will not repeat but will be clipped if the mask image's size is larger than the origin box, except in the case of `round`, where a single mask will be scaled down to fit the origin box.

With `repeat` values, mask images may be clipped at the edge of the origin box if the dimension (width or height) of the box is not an exact multiple of the mask's.

### Aspect ratio

By default, mask images maintain the aspect ratio set by the {{cssxref("mask-size")}} property or their default aspect ratio if the `mask-size` defaults to or is explicitly set to `auto`. Only in the case of `round` value in both directions might the mask aspect ratio be distorted.

If `round` is set in both directions, the resulting repeated mask images will match the aspect ratio of the origin box. As the mask images are scaled to fit, they may be distorted, ensuring the mask images are not clipped. If `round` is set in only one dimension, the aspect ratio of the mask size is respected.

### Rounded repetitions

In the case of `round`, mask images are scaled up or down to fit the mask image in the positioning area a whole number of times. The mask size increases or decreases to fit the nearest natural number or masks, with a minimum of one mask.

The rendered dimensions of the mask is the size of the origin box divided by the number of iterations of masks in that dimension, where the iterations being an integer greater than zero. The number of iterations is: `X' = D / round(D / X)` where `D` is the width or height, and `round()` is a function that returns the nearest integer greater than zero.

For example, if `mask-repeat` is set to `round` and the `mask-size` sets the mask to be `40px` wide, when the origin box is present (greater than `0px` wide) but less than `60px` wide, there will be a single iteration that is 100% of the width of that box. If the box is at least `60px` wide but less than `100px` wide, there will be two iterations that are each `50%` of the box. From 100px to 140px, three masks will fit along the horizontal axis. These "`40px`-wide" masks will only be `40px` wide if the origin box is an exact multiple of `40px`.

## Examples

### Basic usage

This example demonstrates setting the `mask-repeat` property for a single mask.

#### HTML

Our HTML includes a basic {{htmlelement("div")}} element:

```html
<div></div>
```

#### CSS

We define a `250px` square with a red to blue gradient with a `100px` by `100px` star as a mask image. We use the `mask-repeat` property, setting `round` for the horizontal direction and `space` for the vertical value.

```css
div {
  width: 250px;
  height: 250px;
  background-image: linear-gradient(red, blue);

  mask-image: url("/shared-assets/images/examples/mask-star.svg");
  mask-size: 100px 100px;

  mask-repeat: round space;
}
```

#### Results

{{EmbedLiveSample("basic usage", "", "300px")}}

With `space` and `round` on a mask image that is smaller than the origin box, the mask is not clipped. Rather, the `round` value distorts the star to prevent clipping and preventing white space, while `space` maintains the star's aspect ratio, but adds space as needed between masks.

### Round iterations

Using the same HTML and CSS, this demonstration includes a slider that changes the width of the container to show how, with `round`, masks will grow as space allows until another iteration of the mask fits, or shrink until the number of iterations no longer fits.

```html hidden
<div></div>
<label
  >width: <output></output><br />
  <input type="range" min="0" max="400" value="250" id="width" />
</label>
```

```css hidden
div {
  width: 250px;
  height: 250px;
  background-image: linear-gradient(red, blue);

  mask-image: url("/shared-assets/images/examples/mask-star.svg");
  mask-size: 100px 100px;

  mask-repeat: round space;
}
input {
  clear: both;
  width: 90%;
}
```

```js hidden
const div = document.querySelector("div");
const range = document.getElementById("width");
const output = document.querySelector("output");

range.addEventListener("change", () => {
  const value = `${range.value}px`;
  output.innerText = value;
  div.style.width = value;
});
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("round iterations", "", "300px")}}

The mask is defined as `100px` wide. There is a single star when the origin box is from `1px` to `149px` wide, two stars from `150px` to `249px`, three stars from `250px` to `349px`, and so on.

### The shorthand values

This examples demonstrates all `mask-repeat` shorthand (single-keyword) values.

#### HTML

We include several {{htmlelement("section")}} elements each containing a `<div>`, each with a different class name.

```html
<section class="repeat">
  <div></div>
</section>
<section class="space">
  <div></div>
</section>
<section class="round">
  <div></div>
</section>
<section class="no-repeat">
  <div></div>
</section>
<section class="repeat-x">
  <div></div>
</section>
<section class="repeat-y">
  <div></div>
</section>
```

#### CSS

We give every `<div>` the same CSS, except for the `mask-repeat` value, which we match to their parent's class name. We define a mask size, setting the initial `mask-image` at the bottom right, meaning any clipping will occur on the top-most and left-most masks, on their top and left sides.

```css
div {
  width: 180px;
  height: 180px;
  background-image: linear-gradient(red, blue);

  mask-image: url("/shared-assets/images/examples/mask-star.svg");

  mask-size: 50px 50px;
  mask-position: bottom right;
}

.repeat div {
  mask-repeat: repeat;
}
.space div {
  mask-repeat: space;
}
.round div {
  mask-repeat: round;
}
.no-repeat div {
  mask-repeat: no-repeat;
}
.repeat-x div {
  mask-repeat: repeat-x;
}
.repeat-y div {
  mask-repeat: repeat-y;
}
```

We display the class name using generated content.

```css
section::before {
  content: attr(class);
  display: block;
  text-align: center;
  border-bottom: 1px solid;
}
```

```css hidden
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: row wrap;
  gap: 10px;
}
section {
  border: 1px solid;
}
```

#### Results

{{EmbedLiveSample("The shorthand values", "", "450px")}}

The first (and, in the case of `no-repeat`, only) mask star is [sized](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask-size) to be 50px by 50px, and [positioned](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask-position) at the bottom-right of the painting area, with repeated stars placed above and/or to the left of it with any clipping occurring on the top and left of the top-most and left-most stars. Note that all the stars are the same size and shape, except for `round`, where all the masks shrank to 45px x 45px to fit four complete masks in each direction. Had the container been 174px, there would have been three stars in each direction, instead of four, and each star would have been stretched.

### Multiple mask images and repeats

You can specify a different `<repeat-style>` for each mask image, separated by commas:

```css
.extra-repeats {
  mask-image: url("mask1.png"), url("mask2.png");
  mask-repeat: repeat-x, repeat-y, space;
}
```

Each image is matched with the corresponding repeat style. As there are more `mask-repeat` values than `mask-image` values, the excess `mask-repeat` values are ignored.

```css
.missing-repeats {
  mask-image:
    url("mask1.png"), url("mask2.png"), url("mask3.png"), url("mask4.png");
  mask-repeat: repeat-x, repeat-y;
}
```

Each image is matched with a corresponding repeat style. As there are more `mask-image` values than `mask-repeat` values, the `mask-repeat` is repeated until every `mask-image` has an associated `mask-repeat` value. Here, odd numbered masks repeat along the x-axis, while the even numbered masks repeat along the y-axis.

# mask-size

The **`mask-size`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property specifies the sizes of specified mask images. Mask image sizes can be fully or partially constrained to preserve their {{glossary("aspect ratio", "intrinsic aspect ratios")}}.

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword syntax */
mask-size: cover;
mask-size: contain;
mask-size: auto;

/* One-value syntax */
/* Mask width. Sets height to 'auto'. */
mask-size: 50%;
mask-size: 3em;
mask-size: 12px;

/* Two-value syntax */
/* First value: mask width. Second value: mask height */
mask-size: 3em 25%;
mask-size: auto 6px;
mask-size: auto 50%;

/* Multiple values */
mask-size: auto, contain;
mask-size:
  50%,
  50% 25%,
  auto 25%;
mask-size: 6px, auto, contain;

/* Global values */
mask-size: inherit;
mask-size: initial;
mask-size: revert;
mask-size: revert-layer;
mask-size: unset;
```

### Values

The `mask-size` property accepts a comma-separated list of `<bg-size>` values. A `<bg-size>` value is either `cover`, `contain`, a pair of values specifying the width and height (in that order), or a single value specifying the width (in which case, the height is set to `auto`). Values include:

- `contain`
  - : Scales the mask image up or down, while preserving its aspect-ratio, making the mask as large as possible within its container without cropping or stretching it.
    If the mask image is smaller than the container, the mask will tile, or repeat, unless the {{cssxref("mask-repeat")}} property is set to `no-repeat`.

- `cover`
  - : Scales the mask image to the smallest possible size to fill the container while preserving its aspect ratio. If the aspect ratio of the mask image differs from the element, it will be cropped vertically or horizontally.

- `auto`
  - : Maintains the original aspect ratio of the mask source. When set for both the width and height, the origin size of the mask resource is used. Otherwise, `auto` scales the mask image in the corresponding direction such that its original aspect ratio is maintained.

- {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}}
  - : Renders the mask image at the specified length in the corresponding dimension (width if set as the first or only value, height if set as the second value). Negative values are not allowed.

- {{cssxref("&lt;percentage&gt;")}}
  - : Renders the mask image in the corresponding dimension to the specified percentage of the box origin area as defined by the {{cssxref("mask-origin")}} property, which defaults to `padding-box`. Negative values are not allowed.

## Description

The `mask-size` property is used to size mask layers.

An element can have multiple mask layers applied. The number of mask layers is determined by the number of comma-separated values in the {{cssxref("mask-image")}} property value (a value creates a mask layer, even if it is `none`).

Each `mask-size` value in the comma-separated list of values is matched up with an associated mask layer as defined by the list of `mask-image` values, in order. If the number of values in the two properties differs:

- If `mask-size` has more values than `mask-image`, the excess values of `mask-size` are not used.
- If `mask-size` has fewer values than `mask-image`, the `mask-size` values are repeated.

Each `mask-size` value is a `<bg-size>` value. There are three ways to declare each `<bg-size>`: one keyword, two lengths, percentages or the keyword `auto`, or one length, percentage, or `auto`:

- The available keywords are `cover` and `contain`.
- When two values are specified, the first defines the mask width and the second defines its height.
- When one value is specified, it defines only the mask width, with the height set to `auto`.

The width and height values are a {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}}, a {{cssxref("&lt;percentage&gt;")}}, or the `auto` keyword, which is the default. Setting one or both values to `auto` maintains the mask image's original aspect ratio.

The rendered size of the mask image is computed as follows:

- If both components of `mask-size` are specified and are not `auto`, the mask image renders at the specified size.
- If the `mask-size` is `contain` or `cover`, the image is rendered by preserving its aspect ratio at the largest size contained within or covering the mask positioning area. If the image has no intrinsic proportion, such as with gradients, then it is rendered at the size of the mask positioning area.
- If the `mask-size` is `auto` (which resolves to `auto auto`), it is rendered at the size at which the mask would be displayed if no CSS were applied to change the rendering; this is its {{glossary("intrinsic size")}}. If it has no intrinsic dimensions and no intrinsic proportion, as is the case with [CSS gradients](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient), it is rendered at the size of the mask positioning area, defined by the {{cssxref("mask-origin")}} (which defaults to `border-box`).
  If the mask source has no dimensions but has a proportion (aspect-ratio), a value of `auto` will render it as if `contain` had been specified instead. If the image has one intrinsic dimension and a proportion, it is rendered at the size determined by that one dimension and the proportion. If the image has one intrinsic dimension but no proportion, it's rendered using the intrinsic dimension and the corresponding dimension of the mask positioning area.
- If `mask-size` has one `auto` component and one non-`auto` component, which applies to all single-value values, the aspect ratio is maintained if the mask source has an intrinsic proportion. If there are no intrinsic proportions, the `auto` value is assumed to be the dimension of the mask positioning area.

Like with all longhand components of shorthand property, if the {{cssxref("mask")}} shorthand property is set and the value of the `mask-size` property is not defined within any mask layer, the `mask-size` value is reset to its initial value of `auto` for those mask layers.

## Examples

### Setting mask size as a percentage

This example demonstrates basic usage, while also demonstrating percentage values for `mask-size`.

#### HTML

We include two {{htmlelement("div")}} elements:

```html
<div class="width"></div>
<div class="height"></div>
```

#### CSS

The `<div>` elements are defined to be twice as tall as they are wide, with a gradient background and mask:

```css
div {
  width: 200px;
  height: 400px;
  background: blue linear-gradient(red, blue);
  mask-image: url("/shared-assets/images/examples/mdn.svg");
}
```

The width of one `<div>` element's mask is set to `50%`, with the height defaulting to `auto`. The mask's height for the second `<div>` element is set to `50%` with the width set to `auto`:

```css
.width {
  mask-size: 50%;
}

.height {
  mask-size: auto 50%;
}
```

In the `width` case, the mask is rendered `100px` wide (`50%` of the `200px`-wide element). The height defaults to `auto`, maintaining the mask's aspect ratio.
In the `height` case, the mask is rendered `200px` tall (`50%` of the `400px`-high container). The width is explicitly set to `auto`, maintaining the mask's aspect ratio.

```css hidden
body {
  display: flex;
  gap: 20px;
}
```

### Cover and contain

This example demonstrates the keyword values for `mask-size`.

#### HTML

Three {{htmlelement("section")}} elements are defined, each with a different class name, and each containing a `<div>`.

```html
<section class="auto">
  <div></div>
</section>
<section class="cover">
  <div></div>
</section>
<section class="contain">
  <div></div>
</section>
```

#### CSS

The `<div>` elements are defined to be twice as tall as they are wide, with a gradient background and mask:

```css
div {
  width: 200px;
  height: 400px;
  background: blue linear-gradient(red, blue);
  mask-image: url("/shared-assets/images/examples/mask-star.svg");
}
```

The `mask-size` of two of the `<div>` elements is set to one of the property's keyword values. The third `<div>` has a `mask-size` of `auto` set demonstrating the original intrinsic dimensions of the mask:

```css
.auto div {
  mask-size: auto;
}

.cover div {
  mask-size: cover;
}

.contain div {
  mask-size: contain;
}
```

The property values is displayed using [generated content](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_generated_content).

```css
section::before {
  content: "mask-size: " attr(class) ";";
  display: block;
  text-align: center;
  border-bottom: 1px solid;
}
```

```css hidden
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: row wrap;
  gap: 10px;
}
section {
  border: 1px solid;
}
```

With `auto`, the star is displayed at its intrinsic `100px` by `100px` size. With `cover`, the star grows to be `400px` tall, covering the entire origin box. With `contain`, the star grows until one dimension equals the same dimension of the [origin box](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask-origin), meaning that the star is as large as it can be (`200px` wide) but still contained by it.

### When the mask is larger than the container

Using the same HTML and CSS as above, with just a different origin box size, this example explores what happens when the origin box is smaller than the intrinsic dimensions of the mask.

```html hidden
<section class="auto">
  <div></div>
</section>
<section class="cover">
  <div></div>
</section>
<section class="contain">
  <div></div>
</section>
```

```css hidden
div {
  background: blue linear-gradient(red, blue);
  mask-image: url("/shared-assets/images/examples/mask-star.svg");
}

.auto div {
  mask-size: auto;
}

.cover div {
  mask-size: cover;
}

.contain div {
  mask-size: contain;
}

section::before {
  content: attr(class);
  display: block;
  text-align: center;
  border-bottom: 1px solid;
}

body {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: row wrap;
  gap: 10px;
}
section {
  border: 1px solid;
}
```

The only difference is the size of the containing box (and the generated content):

```css
div {
  width: 70px;
  height: 70px;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("When the mask is larger than the container", "", "120px")}}

The `contain` value contains the mask within the origin box. The `cover` value covers it. In both cases, the mask shrinks while maintaining the original aspect ratio. With `auto`, the mask is clipped because the intrinsic dimensions are larger than the box dimensions.

# mask-type

The **`mask-type`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property applies to the SVG {{svgElement("mask")}} element. It defines whether to use the _luminance_ (brightness) or _alpha_ (transparency) content of the mask. This property may be overridden by the {{cssxref("mask-mode")}} property. The `mask-type` property has no effect on image or gradient masks.

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword values */
mask-type: luminance;
mask-type: alpha;

/* Global values */
mask-type: inherit;
mask-type: initial;
mask-type: revert;
mask-type: revert-layer;
mask-type: unset;
```

### Values

- `alpha`
  - : Indicates that the alpha (transparency) values of the `<mask>` should be used.
- `luminance`
  - : Indicates that the [luminance (brightness) values](#understanding_luminance) of the `<mask>` should be used.

## Description

The `mask-type` property is only relevant for the SVG `<mask>` element. If you set `mask-type: luminance`, the mask will use how bright each part of the mask is; if you set `mask-type: alpha`, it will use how transparent or opaque each part of the mask is.

### Default behavior

By default, the SVG `<mask>` element uses `mask-type: luminance`. This means both the color and the transparency of the mask content affect masking. Whether the mask is opaque partially depends on the lightness of the color of the opaque areas:

- Fully opaque white areas (100% luminance) will be masked and visible.
- Black (0% luminance) or fully transparent areas will be clipped and invisible.
- Areas with intermediate luminance values will be partially masked, reflecting both the luminance, or lightness of the mask color, and the alpha transparency of each area of the mask.

### Understanding luminance

The opacity of a `luminance` mask is determined by the `R`, `G`, `B`, and `A` values of an `rgb()` color using the following formula:

`((0.2125 * R) + (0.7154 * G) + (0.0721 * B)) * A`

For example, the color `green` (`#008000` or `rgb(0% 50% 0% / 1)`) has a luminance value of `35.77%`. Any area masked by a solid `green` luminance mask will be `35.77%` visible. If the `mask-type` is set to `alpha`, the same fully opaque `green` color will make the masked area `100%` visible.

If the SVG `<mask>` element has `fill="rgb(0 0 0 / 0.5)"`, which is a 50% transparent black, the corresponding shape on the masked element will display at 50% opacity when `mask-type` is set to `alpha` because the alpha values is `0.5` (50% opacity). But if the `mask-type` defaults to or is set as `luminance` the masked area will be fully clipped and invisible because its luminance is `0`.

### Effect of `mask-mode` on `mask-type`

While the `mask-type` property is set on the SVG `<mask>` element, the {{cssxref("mask-mode")}} property is set on the element being masked (the element you're applying the mask to).
If the mask image source is not an SVG `<mask>`, this property has no effect.

The default value of `mask-mode` is `match-source`, which means the browser uses the `mask-type` value from the `<mask>` element to determine how to interpret it. If `mask-mode` is set to a value other than `match-source`, that value takes precedence and overrides the `mask-type` value of the applied mask.

If the `<mask>` is defined as the mask image's source, and the `mask-mode` is set as or defaults to `match-source`, the `mask-mode` will resolve to the `<mask>` element's `mask-type` value: `luminance` or `alpha`. If not explicitly set, the value defaults to `luminance`.

### Using the `mask-type` property

This example demonstrates how to use the `mask-type` property and the effect of its different values.

#### HTML

We've included two images that will be masked. Other than their class names, the two images are identical.
We've also included an SVG with two `<mask>` elements. Other than their `id` values, the two masks are also identical: each has a green and white heart shape and a semi-transparent white-and-black-filled circle.

```html
<img
  class="alphaMaskType"
  src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/progress-pride-flag.jpg"
  alt="Pride flag" />
<img
  class="luminanceMaskType"
  src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/progress-pride-flag.jpg"
  alt="Pride flag" />

<svg height="0" width="0">
  <mask id="alphaMask">
    <path
      d="M20,70 A40,40,0,0,1,100,70 A40,40,0,0,1,180,70 Q180,130,100,190 Q20,130,20,70 Z"
      fill="green"
      stroke="white"
      stroke-width="20" />
    <circle
      cx="170"
      cy="170"
      r="40"
      fill="rgb(0 0 0 / 0.5)"
      stroke="rgb(255 255 255 / 0.5)"
      stroke-width="20" />
  </mask>
  <mask id="luminanceMask">
    <path
      d="M20,70 A40,40,0,0,1,100,70 A40,40,0,0,1,180,70 Q180,130,100,190 Q20,130,20,70 Z"
      fill="green"
      stroke="white"
      stroke-width="20" />
    <circle
      cx="170"
      cy="170"
      r="40"
      fill="rgb(0 0 0 / 0.5)"
      stroke="rgb(255 255 255 / 0.5)"
      stroke-width="20" />
  </mask>
</svg>
```

#### CSS

We apply the `mask-type` property to the `<mask>` elements, and then apply the `<mask>` elements and the mask source to the images.

```css
mask#alphaMask {
  mask-type: alpha;
}

mask#luminanceMask {
  mask-type: luminance;
}

img.alphaMaskType {
  mask-image: url("#alphaMask");
}

img.luminanceMaskType {
  mask-image: url("#luminanceMask");
}
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Examples", "", "250")}}

As the default value for the `mask-mode` property is `match-source`, the first mask uses the alpha channels only to define the mask: the white and green are fully opaque, and the 50% white and black colors are 50% opaque because only the alpha value of the colors matters. The second example uses the luminance of the colors to determine the opacity of the mask, with white being brighter than green, and semi-transparent white being brighter than semi-transparent black.

# mask

The **`mask`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [shorthand property](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Shorthand_properties) hides an element (partially or fully) by masking or clipping a specified area of the image. It is a shorthand for all the [`mask-*`](#constituent_properties) properties. The property accepts one or more comma-separated values, where each value corresponds to a [`<mask-layer>`](#mask-layer).

## Constituent properties

This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:

- {{cssxref("mask-clip")}}
- {{cssxref("mask-composite")}}
- {{cssxref("mask-image")}}
- {{cssxref("mask-mode")}}
- {{cssxref("mask-origin")}}
- {{cssxref("mask-position")}}
- {{cssxref("mask-repeat")}}
- {{cssxref("mask-size")}}

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword values */
mask: none;

/* Image values */
mask: url("mask.png"); /* Raster image used as mask */
mask: url("masks.svg#star"); /* SVG used as mask */

/* Combined values */
mask: url("masks.svg#star") luminance; /* Luminance mask */
mask: url("masks.svg#star") 40px 20px; /* Mask positioned 40px from the top and 20px from the left */
mask: url("masks.svg#star") 0 0/50px 50px; /* Mask with a width and height of 50px */
mask: url("masks.svg#star") repeat-x; /* Horizontally-repeated mask */
mask: url("masks.svg#star") stroke-box; /* Mask extends to the inside edge of the stroke box */
mask: url("masks.svg#star") exclude; /* Mask combined with background using non-overlapping parts */

/* Multiple masks */
mask:
  url("masks.svg#star") left / 16px repeat-y,
  /* 16px-wide mask on the left side */ url("masks.svg#circle") right / 16px
    repeat-y; /* 16px-wide mask against right side */

/* Global values */
mask: inherit;
mask: initial;
mask: revert;
mask: revert-layer;
mask: unset;
```

### Values

- `<mask-layer>`
  - : One or more comma-separated mask layers, consisting of the following components:
    - `<mask-reference>`
      - : Sets the mask image source. See {{cssxref("mask-image")}}.
    - `<masking-mode>`
      - : Sets the masking mode of the mask image. See {{cssxref("mask-mode")}}.
    - `<position>`
      - : Sets the position of the mask image. See {{cssxref("mask-position")}}.
    - `<bg-size>`
      - : Sets the size of the mask image. See {{cssxref("mask-size")}}.
    - `<repeat-style>`
      - : Sets the repetition of the mask image. See {{cssxref("mask-repeat")}}.
    - `<geometry-box>`
      - : If only one `<geometry-box>` value is given, it sets both the {{cssxref("mask-origin")}} and {{cssxref("mask-clip")}} property values. If two `<geometry-box>` values are present, the first defines the `mask-origin` and the second defines the `mask-clip`.
    - `<geometry-box> | no-clip`
      - : Sets the area affected by the mask image. See {{cssxref("mask-clip")}}.
    - `<compositing-operator>`
      - : Sets the compositing operation used on the current mask layer. See {{cssxref("mask-composite")}}.

## Description

The `mask` shorthand property hides part or all of the element it is applied to. The parts of the element that are hidden, visible, or partially shown depend on either the opacity (alpha channel of the mask) or the brightness (luminance) of the mask. In alpha masking, opaque areas of the mask reveal the element, and transparent areas hide it. In luminance masking, light opaque areas of the mask reveal the element, and dark or transparent areas hide it.

While not all constituent mask properties need to be declared, any values that are omitted default to their initial values, which are:

```css
mask-image: none;
mask-mode: match-source;
mask-position: 0% 0%;
mask-size: auto;
mask-repeat: repeat;
mask-origin: border-box;
mask-clip: border-box;
mask-composite: add;
```

Within each `<mask-layer>`, the `mask-size` component must go after the `mask-position` value, with a forward slash (`/`) separating the two.

If there are two `<geometry-box>` values present, the first is the `mask-origin` value, while the second is the `mask-clip` value. If one `<geometry-box>` value and the `no-clip` keyword are present, the `<geometry-box>` is the value of the `mask-origin` property, as the `no-clip` is only valid for the `mask-clip` property. In this case, the order of the two values doesn't matter. If only one `<geometry-box>` value is present (with no `no-clip` keyterm specified), this value is used for both the `mask-origin` and `mask-clip` properties.

As the `mask` shorthand resets all the `mask-border-*` properties to their `initial` value, you should declare these properties — or the {{cssxref("mask-border")}} shorthand — after any `mask` declarations. When setting `mask` in your declaration block, you also implicitly set the following:

```css
mask-border-source: none;
mask-border-mode: alpha;
mask-border-outset: 0;
mask-border-repeat: stretch;
mask-border-slice: 0;
mask-border-width: auto;
```

For this reason, the specification recommends using the `mask` shorthand rather than the individual component properties to override any masks set earlier in the cascade. This ensures that `mask-border` has also been reset.

## Examples

### Masking an image

In this example, an image is masked using a CSS-generated repeating conic gradient as a mask source. We'll also show the gradient as a background image for comparison.

#### HTML

We include an {{htmlelement("img")}} and an empty {{htmlelement("div")}} element.

```html
<img
  src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/progress-pride-flag.jpg"
  alt="Pride flag" />
<div></div>
```

#### CSS

We set the same {{cssxref("border")}}, {{cssxref("padding")}}, and sizing on both the `<img>` and `<div>`.

```css
img,
div {
  border: 20px dashed rebeccapurple;
  box-sizing: content-box;
  padding: 20px;
  height: 220px;
  width: 220px;
}
```

We then apply a mask to the `<img>`. The `mask-image` is generated using a {{cssxref("gradient/repeating-conic-gradient", "repeating-conic-gradient()")}} function. We define it to be a `100px` by `100px` gradient, which repeats starting at the top and left corner of the image's `content-box`. We include two `<geometry-box>` values; the first sets the `mask-origin` and the second defines the `mask-clip` property value. The gradient goes from transparent to solid `lightgreen`. We used `lightgreen` to demonstrate that it isn't the color of the mask that is important, but rather its transparency.

```css
img {
  mask: repeating-radial-gradient(
      circle,
      transparent 0 5px,
      lightgreen 15px 20px
    )
    content-box border-box 0% 0% / 100px 100px repeat;
}
```

Finally, we use the same value for the `<div>`'s {{cssxref("background")}} shorthand property as we used for the `mask`.

```css
div {
  background: repeating-radial-gradient(
      circle,
      transparent 0 5px,
      lightgreen 15px 20px
    )
    content-box border-box 0% 0% / 100px 100px repeat;
}
```

# math-depth

The **`math-depth`** property describes a notion of _depth_ for each element of a mathematical formula, with respect to the top-level container of that formula. This is used to scale the computed value of the [font-size](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size) of elements when `font-size: math` is applied.

> [!NOTE]
> `font-size: math` is the default for `<math>` elements in the MathML Core [User Agent stylesheet](https://w3c.github.io/mathml-core/#user-agent-stylesheet), so it's not necessary to specify it explicitly.

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword values */
math-depth: auto-add;

/* Relative values */
math-depth: add(2);
math-depth: add(-2);

/* Absolute value */
math-depth: 4;

/* Global values */
math-depth: inherit;
math-depth: initial;
math-depth: revert;
math-depth: revert-layer;
math-depth: unset;
```

### Values

- `auto-add`
  - : Set to the inherited `math-depth` plus 1 when inherited [math-style](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/math-style) is `compact`.
- `add({{cssxref("&lt;integer&gt;")}})`
  - : Set to the inherited `math-depth` plus the specified integer.
- {{cssxref("&lt;integer&gt;")}}
  - : Set to the specified integer.

### Specifying a math depth

The following example shows the effect of changing the `math-depth` property on the font size of subformulas.
The numbers in each subformula indicate the `math-depth` and scale factor applied.

The first `<mtext>` element is used as a reference to other subformulas and has no specific styles applied.
The second and third subformulas have `math-depth` set to `auto-add` and show the effect of scaling depending on the `math-style`.

The last two subformulas show the effect of setting `math-depth` to a specific value.

#### HTML

```html
<p>
  <math>
    <mtext>0</mtext>

    <!-- auto-add value has no effect when math-style is normal -->
    <mrow style="math-style: normal">
      <mrow style="math-depth: auto-add">
        <mtext>0</mtext>
      </mrow>
    </mrow>

    <!-- the inherited math-style is compact, so math-depth is set to 1 -->
    <mrow style="math-depth: auto-add">
      <mtext>1</mtext>
    </mrow>

    <mrow style="math-depth: add(2)">
      <mtext>2</mtext>
      <mrow style="math-depth: add(-1)">

# math-shift

{{SeeCompatTable}}

The `math-shift` property indicates whether superscripts inside MathML formulas should be raised by a normal or compact shift.

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword values */
math-shift: normal;
math-shift: compact;

/* Global values */
math-shift: inherit;
math-shift: initial;
math-shift: revert;
math-shift: revert-layer;
math-shift: unset;
```

### Values

- `normal`
  - : The initial value, indicates normal rendering. Superscripts in MathML formulas use the [superscriptShiftUp](https://w3c.github.io/mathml-core/#dfn-superscriptshiftup) parameter from the OpenType MATH table.
- `compact`
  - : Indicates compact rendering. Superscripts in MathML formulas use the [superscriptShiftUpCramped](https://w3c.github.io/mathml-core/#dfn-superscriptshiftupcramped) parameter from the OpenType MATH table, which is generally smaller.

# max-block-size

The **`max-block-size`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property specifies the maximum size of an element in the direction opposite that of the writing direction as specified by {{cssxref("writing-mode")}}. That is, if the writing direction is horizontal, then `max-block-size` is equivalent to {{cssxref("max-height")}}; if the writing direction is vertical, `max-block-size` is the same as {{cssxref("max-width")}}.

The other dimension's maximum length is specified using the {{cssxref("max-inline-size")}} property.

This is useful because the `max-width` is always used for horizontal sizes and `max-height` is always used for vertical sizes, and if you need to set lengths based on the size of your text content, you need to be able to do so with the writing direction in mind.

Any time you would normally use `max-height` or `max-width`, you should instead use `max-block-size` to set the maximum "height" of the content (even though this may not be a vertical value) and `max-inline-size` to set the maximum "width" of the content (although this may instead be vertical rather than horizontal). See [`writing-mode` examples](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/writing-mode#examples), which show the different writing modes in action.

```

### Values

The `max-block-size` property's value can be any value that's legal for the {{cssxref("max-width")}} and {{cssxref("max-height")}} properties:

- {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}}
  - : Defines the `max-block-size` as an absolute value.
- {{cssxref("&lt;percentage&gt;")}}
  - : Defines the `max-block-size` as a percentage of the containing block's size in block axis.
- `none`
  - : No limit on the size of the box.
- {{cssxref("max-content")}}
  - : The intrinsic preferred `max-block-size`.
- {{cssxref("min-content")}}
  - : The intrinsic minimum `max-block-size`.
- {{cssxref("fit-content")}}
  - : Use the available space, but not more than [max-content](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max-content), i.e., `min(max-content, max(min-content, stretch))`.
- [`fit-content(<length-percentage>)`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/fit-content_function)
  - : Uses the `fit-content` formula with the available space replaced by the specified argument, i.e., `min(max-content, max(min-content, argument))`.

### How writing-mode affects directionality

The values of `writing-mode` affect the mapping of `max-block-size` to `max-width` or `max-height` as follows:

| Values of `writing-mode`                                                  | `max-block-size` is equivalent to |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `horizontal-tb`, `lr`, `lr-tb`, `rl`, `rb`, `rb-rl`                       | {{cssxref("max-height")}}         |
| `vertical-rl`, `vertical-lr`, `sideways-rl`, `sideways-lr`, `tb`, `tb-rl` | {{cssxref("max-width")}}          |

> [!NOTE]
> The `writing-mode` values `sideways-lr` and `sideways-rl` were removed from the CSS Writing Modes Level 3 specification late in its design process. They may be restored in Level 4.

> [!NOTE]
> The writing modes `lr`, `lr-tb`, `rl`, `rb`, and `rb-tl` are no longer allowed in {{Glossary("HTML")}} contexts; they may only be used in {{Glossary("SVG")}} 1.x contexts.

## Examples

### Setting max-block-size with horizontal and vertical text

In this example, the same text (the opening sentences from [Herman Melville's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Melville) novel _[Moby-Dick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby-Dick)_) is presented in both the `horizontal-tb` and `vertical-rl` writing modes.

Everything else about the two boxes is identical, including the values used for `max-block-size`.

#### HTML

The HTML establishes the two {{HTMLElement("div")}} blocks that will be presented with their {{cssxref("writing-mode")}} set using the classes `horizontal` or `vertical`. Both boxes share the `standard-box` class, which establishes coloring, padding, and their respective values of `max-block-size`.

```html
<p>Writing mode <code>horizontal-tb</code> (the default):</p>
<div class="standard-box horizontal">
  Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or
  no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I
  thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It
  is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.
</div>

<p>Writing mode <code>vertical-rl</code>:</p>
<div class="standard-box vertical">
  Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or
  no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I
  thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It
  is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.
</div>
```

#### CSS

The CSS defines three classes. The first, `standard-box`, is applied to both boxes, as seen above. It provides standard styling including the minimum and maximum block sizes, font size, and so forth.

After that come the classes `horizontal` and `vertical`, which add the {{cssxref("writing-mode")}} property to the box, with the value set to `horizontal-tb` or `vertical-rl` depending on which class is used.

```css
.standard-box {
  padding: 4px;
  background-color: #abcdef;
  color: black;
  font:
    16px "Open Sans",
    "Helvetica",
    "Arial",
    sans-serif;
  max-block-size: 160px;
  min-block-size: 100px;
}

.horizontal {
  writing-mode: horizontal-tb;
}

.vertical {
  writing-mode: vertical-rl;
}
```

# max-content

The `max-content` sizing keyword represents the [maximum intrinsic size](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Intrinsic_Size#maximum_intrinsic_size) of an element.
The keyword expands the element to the largest size needed to display its content without any soft wraps.
For text content, this keyword does not wrap the content at all, even if it causes overflow.

The {{cssxref("interpolate-size")}} property and {{cssxref("calc-size()")}} function can be used to enable animations to and from `max-content`.

## Syntax

```css
/* Used as a length value */
width: max-content;
inline-size: max-content;
height: max-content;
block-size: max-content;

/* Used in grid tracks */
grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr max-content;
```

## Examples

### Sizing boxes with max-content

#### HTML

```html
<div id="container">
  <div class="item">Item</div>
  <div class="item">
    Item with more text in it which will overflow the fixed width box.
  </div>
</div>
```

#### CSS

```css
#container {
  background-color: #8cffa0;
  padding: 10px;
  width: 200px;
}

.item {
  width: max-content;

# max-height

The **`max-height`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets the maximum height of an element. It prevents the [used value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Value_processing#used_value) of the {{cssxref("height")}} property from becoming larger than the value specified for `max-height`.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: max-height")}}

```

```css interactive-example-choice
max-height: 7em;
```

```css interactive-example-choice

  - : Limits the maximum height of the element's [margin box](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Box_model#parts_of_a_box) to the height of its [containing block](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Containing_block#identifying_the_containing_block). It attempts to make the margin box fill the available space in the containing block, so in a way behaving similar to `100%` but applying the resulting size to the margin box rather than the box determined by [box-sizing](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing).

# max-inline-size

The **`max-inline-size`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property defines the horizontal or vertical maximum size of an element's block, depending on its writing mode. It corresponds to either the {{cssxref("max-width")}} or the {{cssxref("max-height")}} property, depending on the value of {{cssxref("writing-mode")}}.

If the writing mode is vertically oriented, the value of `max-inline-size` relates to the maximal height of the element; otherwise, it relates to the maximal width of the element. A related property is {{cssxref("max-block-size")}}, which defines the other dimension of the element.

# max()

The **`max()`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [function](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_and_units/CSS_value_functions) lets you set the largest (most positive) value from a list of comma-separated expressions as the value of a CSS property value. The `max()` function can be used anywhere a {{CSSxRef("&lt;length&gt;")}}, {{CSSxRef("&lt;frequency&gt;")}}, {{CSSxRef("&lt;angle&gt;")}}, {{CSSxRef("&lt;time&gt;")}}, {{CSSxRef("&lt;percentage&gt;")}}, {{CSSxRef("&lt;number&gt;")}}, or {{CSSxRef("&lt;integer&gt;")}} is allowed.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: max()")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
width: max(20vw, 400px);
```

```css interactive-example-choice
width: max(20vw, 100px);
```

```css interactive-example-choice
width: max(5vw, 100px);
```

```html interactive-example
<section class="default-example" id="default-example">
  <div class="transition-all" id="example-element">
    <img
      alt="Firefox logo"
      class="logo"
      src="/shared-assets/images/examples/firefox-logo.svg" />
  </div>
</section>
```

In the first example shown above, the width will be at least 400px, but will be wider if the viewport is more than 2000px wide (in which case 1vw would be 20px, so 20vw would be 400px). This technique uses an absolute unit to specify a fixed minimum value for the property, and a relative unit to allow the value to grow to suit larger viewports.

## Syntax

```css
max(1, 2, 3)
max(1px, 2px, 3px)
```

### Parameters

The `max()` function takes one or more comma-separated expressions as its parameter, with the largest (most positive) expression value used as the value of the property to which it is assigned.

The expressions can be math expressions (using arithmetic operators), literal values, or other expressions, such as {{CSSxRef("attr", "attr()")}}, that evaluate to a valid argument type (like {{CSSxRef("&lt;length&gt;")}}), or nested {{CSSxRef("min", "min()")}} and `max()` functions.

You can use different units for each value in your expression. You may also use parentheses to establish computation order when needed.

### Notes

- Math expressions involving percentages for widths and heights on table columns, table column groups, table rows, table row groups, and table cells in both auto and fixed layout tables _may_ be treated as if `auto` had been specified.
- It is permitted to nest `min()` and other `max()` functions as expression values. The expressions are full math expressions, so you can use direct addition, subtraction, multiplication and division without using the calc() function itself.
- The expression can be values combining the addition ( + ), subtraction ( - ), multiplication ( \* ) and division ( / ) operators, using standard operator precedence rules. Make sure to put a space on each side of the + and - operands. The operands in the expression may be any \<length> syntax value.
- You can (and often need to) combine `min()` and `max()` values, or use `max()` within a `clamp()` or `calc()` function.

## Formal syntax

{{CSSSyntax}}

## Accessibility

When `max()` is used for controlling text size, make sure the text is always large enough to read. A suggestion is to use the {{CSSxRef("min", "min()")}} function nested within a `max()` that has as its second value a [relative length unit](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#relative_length_units) that is always large enough to read. For example:

```css
small {
  font-size: max(min(0.5vw, 0.5em), 1rem);
}
```

This ensures a minimum size of _1rem_, with a text size that scales if the page is zoomed.

- [Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.4 | W3C Understanding WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-scale.html)

## Examples

### Setting a minimum size for a font

Another use case for `max()` is to allow a font size to grow while ensuring it is at least a minimum size, enabling responsive font sizes while ensuring legibility.

Let's look at some CSS:

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 2rem;
}
h1.responsive {
  font-size: max(4vw, 2em, 2rem);
}
```

The font-size will at minimum be 2rems, or twice the default size of font for the page. This ensures that it is legible and accessible.

```html
<h1>This text is always legible, but doesn't change size</h1>
<h1 class="responsive">
  This text is always legible, and is responsive, to a point
</h1>
```

# min-block-size

The **`min-block-size`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property defines the minimum horizontal or vertical size of an element's block, depending on its writing mode. It corresponds to either the {{cssxref("min-width")}} or the {{cssxref("min-height")}} property, depending on the value of {{cssxref("writing-mode")}}.

If the writing mode is vertically oriented, the value of `min-block-size` relates to the minimum width of the element; otherwise, it relates to the minimum height of the element. A related property is {{cssxref("min-inline-size")}}, which defines the other dimension of the element.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: min-block-size")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
min-block-size: 150px;
writing-mode: horizontal-tb;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
min-block-size: 150px;
writing-mode: vertical-rl;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
min-block-size: 20px;
writing-mode: horizontal-tb;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
min-block-size: 15em;
writing-mode: vertical-lr;
```

```html interactive-example
<section class="default-example" id="default-example">
  <div class="transition-all" id="example-element">
    This is a box where you can change the minimum block size. <br />If there is
    more content than the minimum the box will grow in the block dimension as
    needed by the content.
  </div>
</section>

# min-content

The `min-content` sizing keyword represents the [minimum intrinsic size](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Intrinsic_Size#minimum_intrinsic_size) of an element.
The keyword shrinks the element to the smallest possible size without causing avoidable overflow of its content.
For text content, this keyword causes the content to wrap at every opportunity (such as spaces between words), and the element will be only as wide as the longest word.

The {{cssxref("interpolate-size")}} property and {{cssxref("calc-size()")}} function can be used to enable animations to and from `min-content`.

## Syntax

```css
/* Used as a length value */
width: min-content;
inline-size: min-content;
height: min-content;
block-size: min-content;

/* Used in grid tracks */
grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr min-content;
```

## Examples

### Sizing boxes with min-content

```html
<div class="item">Item</div>
<div class="item">Item with more text in it.</div>
```

#### CSS

```css
.item {

# min-height

The **`min-height`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets the minimum height of an element. It prevents the [used value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Value_processing#used_value) of the {{cssxref("height")}} property from becoming smaller than the value specified for `min-height`.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: min-height")}}

```

```css interactive-example-choice
min-height: 7em;
```

```css interactive-example-choice

The element's height is set to the value of `min-height` whenever `min-height` is larger than {{cssxref("max-height")}} or {{cssxref("height")}}.

## Syntax

```css
/* <length> value */

  - : Defines the `min-height` as a percentage of the containing block's height.
- `auto`
  - : The browser will calculate and select a `min-height` for the specified element.
- {{cssxref("max-content")}}
  - : The intrinsic preferred `min-height`.
- {{cssxref("min-content")}}
  - : The intrinsic minimum `min-height`.
- {{cssxref("fit-content")}}
  - : Use the available space, but not more than [max-content](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max-content), i.e., `min(max-content, max(min-content, stretch))`.
- [`fit-content(<length-percentage>)`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/fit-content_function)
  - : Uses the `fit-content` formula with the available space replaced by the specified argument, i.e., `min(max-content, max(min-content, argument))`.
- `stretch`
  - : Limits the minimum height of the element's [margin box](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Box_model#parts_of_a_box) to the height of its [containing block](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Containing_block#identifying_the_containing_block). It attempts to make the margin box fill the available space in the containing block, so in a way behaving similar to `100%` but applying the resulting size to the margin box rather than the box determined by [box-sizing](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing).

```

The element's width is set to the value of `min-width` whenever `min-width` is larger than {{Cssxref("max-width")}} or {{Cssxref("width")}}.

## Syntax

min-width: initial;
min-width: revert;
min-width: revert-layer;

```

### Values

- {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}}
  - : Defines the `min-width` as an absolute value.
- {{cssxref("&lt;percentage&gt;")}}
  - : Defines the `min-width` as a percentage of the containing block's width.
- `auto`
  - : The default value. The source of the automatic value for the specified element depends on its display value. For block boxes, inline boxes, inline blocks, and all table layout boxes `auto` resolves to `0`.

    For [flex items](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Flex_Item) and grid items, the minimum width value is either the specified suggested size, such as the value of the `width` property, the transferred size, calculated if the element has an `aspect-ratio` set and the height is a definite size, otherwise, the `min-content` size is used. If the flex or grid item is a {{glossary("scroll container")}}, or if a grid item spans more than one flexible column track, the automatic minimum size is `0`.

- {{cssxref("max-content")}}
  - : The intrinsic preferred `min-width`.
- {{cssxref("min-content")}}
  - : The intrinsic minimum `min-width`.
- {{cssxref("fit-content")}}
  - : Use the available space, but not more than [`max-content`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max-content), i.e., `min(max-content, max(min-content, stretch))`.
- [`fit-content(<length-percentage>)`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/fit-content_function)
  - : Uses the `fit-content` formula with the available space replaced by the specified argument, i.e., `min(max-content, max(min-content, argument))`.
- `stretch`
  - : Limits the minimum width of the element's [margin box](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Box_model#parts_of_a_box) to the width of its [containing block](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Containing_block#identifying_the_containing_block).

# min()

The **`min()`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [function](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_and_units/CSS_value_functions) lets you set the smallest (most negative) value from a list of comma-separated expressions as the value of a CSS property value. The `min()` function can be used anywhere a {{CSSxRef("&lt;length&gt;")}}, {{CSSxRef("&lt;frequency&gt;")}}, {{CSSxRef("&lt;angle&gt;")}}, {{CSSxRef("&lt;time&gt;")}}, {{CSSxRef("&lt;percentage&gt;")}}, {{CSSxRef("&lt;number&gt;")}}, or {{CSSxRef("&lt;integer&gt;")}} is allowed.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: min()")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
width: min(50vw, 200px);
```

```css interactive-example-choice
width: min(100vw, 4000px);
```

```css interactive-example-choice
width: min(150vw, 100px);
```

```html interactive-example
<section class="default-example" id="default-example">
  <div class="transition-all" id="example-element">
    <img
      alt="Firefox logo"
      class="logo"
      src="/shared-assets/images/examples/firefox-logo.svg" />
  </div>
</section>
```

In the first above example, the width will be at most 200px, but will be smaller if the viewport is less than 400px wide (in which case 1vw would be 4px, so 50vw would be 200px). This technique uses an absolute unit to specify a fixed maximum value for the property, and a relative unit to allow the value to shrink to suit smaller viewports.

## Syntax

```css
max(1, 2, 3)
max(1px, 2px, 3px)
```

### Parameters

The `min()` function takes one or more comma-separated expressions as its parameter, with the smallest (most negative) expression value result used as the value.

The expressions can be math expressions (using arithmetic operators), literal values, or other expressions, such as {{CSSxRef("attr", "attr()")}}, that evaluate to a valid argument type (like {{CSSxRef("&lt;length&gt;")}}).

You can use different units for each value in your expression, if you wish. You may also use parentheses to establish computation order when needed.

### Notes

- Math expressions involving percentages for widths and heights on table columns, table column groups, table rows, table row groups, and table cells in both auto and fixed layout tables _may_ be treated as if `auto` had been specified.
- It is permitted to nest `max()` and other `min()` functions as expression values. The expressions are full math expressions, so you can use direct addition, subtraction, multiplication and division without using the `calc()` function itself.
- The expression can be values combining the addition ( + ), subtraction ( - ), multiplication ( \* ) and division ( / ) operators, using standard operator precedence rules. Make sure to put a space on each side of the + and - operands. The operands in the expression may be any `<length>` syntax value.
- You can (and often need to) combine `min()` and `max()` values, or use `min()` within a `clamp()` or `calc()` function.
- You can provide more than two arguments, if you have multiple constraints to apply.

## Formal syntax

{{CSSSyntax}}

## Accessibility

When using `min()` to set a maximum font size, ensure that the font can still be scaled at least 200% for readability (without assistive technology like a zoom function).

- [Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.4 | W3C Understanding WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-scale.html)

## Examples

### Setting a maximum size for a label and input

Another use case for `min()` is to set a maximum size on responsive form controls: enabling the width of labels and inputs to shrink as the width of the form shrinks.

Let's look at some CSS:

```css
input,
label {
  padding: 2px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  display: inline-block;
  width: min(40%, 400px);
  background-color: pink;
}

form {
  margin: 4px;
  border: 1px solid black;
  padding: 4px;
}
```

Here, the form itself, along with the margin, border, and padding, will be 100% of its parent's width. We declare the input and label to be the lesser of 40% of the form width up to the padding or 400px wide, whichever is smaller. In other words, the widest that the label and input can be is 400px. The narrowest they will be is 40% of the form's width, which on a smartwatch's screen is very small.

```html
<form>
  <label for="misc">Type something:</label>
  <input type="text" id="misc" name="misc" />
</form>
```

# minmax()

The **`minmax()`** [CSS function](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_and_units/CSS_value_functions) defines a size range greater than or equal to _min_ and less than or equal to _max_. It is used with [CSS grids](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout).

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: minmax()")}}

```css interactive-example-choice

}

#example-element > div {
  background-color: rgb(0 0 255 / 0.2);
  border: 3px solid blue;
  text-align: left;
}
```

## Syntax

```css
/* <inflexible-breadth>, <track-breadth> values */
minmax(200px, 1fr)
minmax(400px, 50%)
minmax(30%, 300px)
minmax(100px, max-content)
minmax(min-content, 400px)

/* <inflexible-breadth>, <fixed-breadth> values */
minmax(400px, 50%)
minmax(30%, 300px)
minmax(min-content, 200px)
minmax(max-content, 200px)
minmax(auto, 300px)
```

A function taking two parameters, _min_ and _max_.

Each parameter can be a `<length>`, a `<percentage>`, a `<flex>` value, or one of the keyword values `max-content`, `min-content`, or `auto`.

If _max_ < _min_, then _max_ is ignored and `minmax(min,max)` is treated as _min_. As a maximum, a {{cssxref("flex_value","&lt;flex&gt;")}} value sets the flex factor of a grid track; it is invalid as a minimum.

### Values

- {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}}
  - : A non-negative length.
- {{cssxref("&lt;percentage&gt;")}}
  - : A non-negative percentage relative to the inline size of the grid container in column grid tracks, and the block size of the grid container in row grid tracks. If the size of the grid container depends on the size of its tracks, then the `<percentage>` must be treated as `auto`. The {{glossary("user agent")}} may adjust the intrinsic size contributions of the track to the size of the grid container and increase the final size of the track by the minimum amount that would result in honoring the percentage.
- {{cssxref("&lt;flex&gt;")}}
  - : A non-negative dimension with the unit `fr` specifying the track's flex factor. Each `<flex>`-sized track takes a share of the remaining space in proportion to its flex factor.
- {{cssxref("max-content")}}
  - : Represents the largest max-content contribution of the grid items occupying the grid track.
- {{cssxref("min-content")}}
  - : Represents the largest min-content contribution of the grid items occupying the grid track.
- `auto`
  - : As `min`, it represents the largest minimum size (as specified by {{cssxref("min-width")}}/{{cssxref("min-height")}}) of the grid items occupying the grid track.
    As `max`, it is identical to `max-content`. However, unlike `max-content`, it allows expansion of the track by the {{cssxref("align-content")}} and {{cssxref("justify-content")}} property values like `normal` and `stretch`.

### CSS properties

`minmax()` function can be used within:

- {{CSSxRef("grid-template-columns")}}
- {{CSSxRef("grid-template-rows")}}
- {{CSSxRef("grid-auto-columns")}}
- {{CSSxRef("grid-auto-rows")}}

## Examples

### CSS

```css
#container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: minmax(min-content, 300px) minmax(200px, 1fr) 150px;
  grid-gap: 5px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  height: 200px;
  width: 100%;
  background-color: #8cffa0;
  padding: 10px;
}

#container > div {
  background-color: #8ca0ff;
  padding: 5px;
}
```

### HTML

```html
<div id="container">
  <div>Item as wide as the content, but at most 300 pixels.</div>
  <div>Item with flexible width but a minimum of 200 pixels.</div>
  <div>Inflexible item of 150 pixels width.</div>
</div>
```

# mix-blend-mode

The **`mix-blend-mode`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets how an element's content should blend with the content of the element's parent and the element's background.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: mix-blend-mode")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
mix-blend-mode: normal;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
mix-blend-mode: multiply;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
mix-blend-mode: hard-light;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
mix-blend-mode: difference;
```

```html interactive-example
<section class="default-example" id="default-example">
  <div class="example-container">
    <img
      id="example-element"
      src="/shared-assets/images/examples/firefox-logo.svg"
      width="200" />
  </div>
</section>
```

```css interactive-example
.example-container {
  background-color: sandybrown;
}
```

```

### Values

- {{cssxref("&lt;blend-mode&gt;")}}
  - : The blending mode that should be applied.
- `plus-darker`
  - : Blending using the [_plus-darker_ compositing operator](https://drafts.fxtf.org/compositing/#porterduffcompositingoperators_plus_darker).
- `plus-lighter`
  - : Blending using the [_plus-lighter_ compositing operator](https://drafts.fxtf.org/compositing/#porterduffcompositingoperators_plus_lighter). Useful for cross-fade effects (prevents unwanted blinking when two overlaying elements animate their opacity in opposite directions).

# mod()

The **`mod()`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [function](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_and_units/CSS_value_functions) returns a modulus left over when the first parameter is divided by the second parameter, similar to the JavaScript [remainder operator (`%`)](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Remainder). The modulus is the value left over when one operand, the dividend, is divided by a second operand, the divisor. It always takes the sign of the divisor.

The calculation is `a - (Math.floor(a / b) * b)`. For example, the CSS `mod(21, -4)` function returns the remainder of `-3`. The full calculation is `21 - (Math.floor(21 / -4) * -4)`. When dividing `21` by `-4`, the result is `-5.25`. This is floored to `-6`. Multiplying `-6` by `-4` is `24`. Subtracting this `24` from the original `21`, the remainder is -3.

## Syntax

```css
/* Unitless <number> */
line-height: mod(7, 2); /* 1 */
line-height: mod(14, 5); /* 4 */
line-height: mod(3.5, 2); /* 1.5 */

/* Unit based <percentage> and <dimension> */
margin: mod(15%, 2%); /* 1% */
margin: mod(18px, 4px); /* 2px */
margin: mod(19rem, 5rem); /* 4rem */
margin: mod(29vmin, 6vmin); /* 5vmin */
margin: mod(1000px, 29rem); /* 72px - if root font-size is 16px */

/* Negative/positive values */
rotate: mod(100deg, 30deg); /* 10deg */
rotate: mod(135deg, -90deg); /* -45deg */
rotate: mod(-70deg, 20deg); /* 10deg */
rotate: mod(-70deg, -15deg); /* -10deg */

/* Calculations */
scale: mod(10 * 2, 1.7); /* 1.3 */
rotate: mod(10turn, 18turn / 3); /* 4turn */
transition-duration: mod(20s / 2, 3000ms * 2); /* 4s */
```

### Parameters

The `mod(dividend, divisor)` function accepts two comma-separated values as its parameters. Both parameters must have the same type, [number](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/number), [dimension](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/dimension), or {{cssxref("percentage")}}, for the function to be valid. While the units in the two parameters don't need to be the same, they do need of the same dimension type, such as {{cssxref("length")}}, {{cssxref("angle")}}, {{cssxref("time")}}, or {{cssxref("frequency")}} to be valid.

- `dividend`
  - : A calculation that resolves to a {{CSSxREF("&lt;number&gt;")}}, {{CSSxREF("&lt;dimension&gt;")}}, or {{CSSxREF("&lt;percentage&gt;")}} representing the dividend.

- `divisor`
  - : A calculation that resolves to a {{CSSxREF("&lt;number&gt;")}}, {{CSSxREF("&lt;dimension&gt;")}}, or {{CSSxREF("&lt;percentage&gt;")}} representing the divisor.

### Return value

Returns a {{CSSxREF("&lt;number&gt;")}}, {{CSSxREF("&lt;dimension&gt;")}}, or {{CSSxREF("&lt;percentage&gt;")}} (corresponds to the parameters' type) representing the modulus, that is, the operation left over.

- If `divisor` is `0`, the result is `NaN`.
- If `dividend` is `infinite`, the result is `NaN`.
- If `divisor` is positive the result is positive (`0⁺`), and if `divisor` is negative the result is negative (`0⁻`).

# Firefox (-moz-) vendor-prefixed CSS extensions

A {{glossary("vendor prefix")}} is used to indicate that a feature is specific to a certain browser.
Firefox supports several extensions to [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), which are prefixed with `-moz-`.

## -moz-prefixed properties without standard equivalents

> [!NOTE]
> These extensions are mostly experimental or deprecated but kept for backward compatibility.
> You should avoid using them on production websites.

- {{CSSxRef("-moz-float-edge")}} {{deprecated_inline}}
- {{CSSxRef("-moz-force-broken-image-icon")}} {{deprecated_inline}}: Use `alt` text instead.
- {{CSSxRef("-moz-orient")}}
- `-moz-osx-font-smoothing`: A similar {{CSSxRef("font-smooth")}} equivalent exists.
- {{CSSxRef("-moz-user-focus")}} {{deprecated_inline}}
- {{CSSxRef("-moz-user-input")}} {{deprecated_inline}}
- `-moz-user-modify`: A non-prefixed {{CSSxRef("user-modify")}} equivalent exists, but the HTML [`contenteditable`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/contenteditable) attribute is recommended instead.

## -moz-prefixed properties with standard equivalents

The following properties were implemented first using the `-moz-` vendor prefix, but are now supported in Firefox using the standard (non-prefixed) syntax.
Support for the prefixed version is typically dropped eventually, so use the standard property instead.

Initially, in [CSS Level 1](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS1/#color-units), only 16 basic colors were defined, with `orange` added in [CSS Level 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/syndata.html#value-def-color). Web designers found this list too short, and browser vendors added numerous names for colors based on the X11 color names. In [SVG 1](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/types.html#DataTypeColor), then in [CSS Colors Level 3](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-3/#svg-color), these names got standardized, formally defined, and made uniform (some had different spellings that are now aliases). They are called _extended color keywords_, _X11 colors_, or _SVG colors_.

In [CSS Colors Level 4](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-4/#named-colors), an additional color, `rebeccapurple` was added to honor [web pioneer Eric Meyer](https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2014/06/19/rebeccapurple/).

### transparent

The `transparent` keyword represents a fully transparent color. This makes the background behind the colored item completely visible. Technically, `transparent` is a shortcut for `rgb(0 0 0 / 0%)`.

To prevent unexpected behavior, such as in a {{cssxref("gradient")}}, the current CSS spec states that `transparent` should be calculated in the [alpha-premultiplied color space](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/#interpolation-alpha). However, be aware that older browsers may treat it as black with an alpha value of `0`.

The `transparent` keyword wasn't a true color in CSS Level 2 (Revision 1). It was a special keyword that could be used instead of a regular `<color>` value on two CSS properties: {{Cssxref("background")}} and {{Cssxref("border")}}. It was essentially added to allow developers to override an inherited solid color. With the advent of alpha channels in CSS Colors Level 3, `transparent` was redefined as a true color. It can now be used wherever a `<color>` value can be used.

## Description

All names specify a color in the [sRGB color space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB). Although the names more or less describe their respective colors, they are essentially artificial, without a strict rationale behind the terms used.

The color keywords all represent plain, solid colors without transparency.

Several keywords are aliases for each other:

- `aqua` / `cyan`
- `fuchsia` / `magenta`
- `darkgray` / `darkgrey`
- `darkslategray` / `darkslategrey`
- `dimgray` / `dimgrey`
- `lightgray` / `lightgrey`
- `lightslategray` / `lightslategrey`
- `gray` / `grey`
- `slategray` / `slategrey`

Though many keywords have been adapted from [X11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System), their RGB values may differ from the corresponding color on X11 systems since manufacturers sometimes tailor X11 colors to their specific hardware.

## Examples

### Using named colors

#### HTML

```html
<div id="container">
  <div id="one"></div>
  <div id="two"></div>
  <div id="three"></div>
</div>
```

#### CSS

```css
#container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-around;
  background-color: darkslateblue;
  padding: 20px;
}

#container > div {

# Namespace separator

The **namespace separator** (`|`) separates the selector from the namespace, identifying the {{glossary("namespace")}}, or lack thereof, for a type selector.

```css
/* Links in the namespace named myNameSpace */
myNameSpace|a {
  font-weight: bold;
}
/* paragraphs in any namespace (including no namespace) */
*|p {
  color: darkblue;
}
/* heading level 2 not in a namespace */
|h2 {
  margin-bottom: 0;
}
```

[Type selectors](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Type_selectors) and the [universal selector](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Universal_selectors) allow an optional namespace component. When a namespace has been previously declared via {{CSSXref("@namespace")}}, these selectors can be namespaced by prepending the selector with the name of the namespace separated by the namespace separator (`|`). This is useful when dealing with documents containing multiple namespaces such as HTML with inline SVG or MathML, or XML that mixes multiple vocabularies.

- `ns|h1` - matches `<h1>` elements in namespace `ns`
- `*|h1` - matches all `<h1>` elements
- `|h1` - matches all `<h1>` elements outside of any declared or implied namespace

## Syntax

```css
namespace|element { style properties }
```

## Examples

By default, all elements in an HTML or SVG element have a namespace as the `http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml` and `http://www.w3.org/2000/svg` namespace are implied. The {{domxref("document.createElementNS")}} method, with an empty string for the namespace parameter, can be used to create elements with no namespace.

### Named namespace example

In this example, all elements are in a namespace.

#### HTML

No namespaces are explicitly declared in the HTML or within the SVG.

```html
<p>This paragraph <a href="#">has a link</a>.</p>

<svg width="400" viewBox="0 0 400 20">
  <a href="#">
    <text x="0" y="15">Link created in SVG</text>
  </a>
</svg>
```

#### CSS

The CSS declares two namespaces, then assigns styles to links globally (`a`), to links in no namespace (`|a`), to links in any namespace or no namespace (`*|a`), and then to two different named namespaces (`svgNamespace|a` and `htmlNameSpace|a`).

```css
@namespace svgNamespace url("http://www.w3.org/2000/svg");
@namespace htmlNameSpace url("http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml");
/* All `<a>`s in the default namespace, in this case, all `<a>`s */
a {
  font-size: 1.4rem;
}
/* no namespace */
|a {
  text-decoration: wavy overline lime;
  font-weight: bold;
}
/* all namespaces (including no namespace) */
*|a {
  color: red;
  fill: red;
  font-style: italic;
}
/* only the svgNamespace namespace, which is <svg> content */
svgNamespace|a {
  color: green;
  fill: green;
}
/* The htmlNameSpace namespace, which is the HTML document */
htmlNameSpace|a {
  text-decoration-line: line-through;
}
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Named_namespace_example", "100%", 100)}}

The selector `|a`, a link not in a namespace, doesn't match any links. In HTML, the `http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml` is implied, meaning all HTML is in a namespace, even if none is explicitly declared. In SVG, even if not explicitly set, the `http://www.w3.org/2000/svg` namespace is also implied. This means all the content is within at least one namespace.

### Default namespace and no namespace

In this example, we use JavaScript to create an element without a namespace and append it to the document. We set the SVG namespace to be the default namespace by defining the unnamed namespace with `@namespace`.

> [!NOTE]
> If a default, or unnamed, namespace is defined, universal and type selectors apply only to elements in that namespace.

#### HTML

No namespaces are explicitly declared in the HTML or within the SVG.

```html
<p><a href="#">A link</a> in the implied HTML namespace.</p>

<svg width="400" viewBox="0 0 400 20">
  <a href="#">
    <text x="0" y="15">Link created in SVG namespace</text>
  </a>
</svg>
```

#### JavaScript

With JavaScript, with {{DOMXRef("document.createElementNS")}}, we create an anchor link without a namespace, then append the link.

```js
// create 'no namespace' anchor
const a = document.createElementNS("", "a");
a.href = "#";
a.appendChild(document.createTextNode("Link created without a namespace"));

document.body.appendChild(a);
```

#### CSS

We declare a namespace with {{cssxref("@namespace")}}. By omitting the name for the namespace, the `@namespace` declaration creates a default namespace.

```css
/* By omitting a name, this sets SVG as the default namespace */
@namespace url("http://www.w3.org/2000/svg");

/* `<a>` in the default (set to SVG) namespace */
a {
  font-size: 1.4rem;
}

/* `<svg>` and `<p>` in the default (set to SVG) namespace */
svg,
p {
  border: 5px solid gold;
}

/* links outside of any namespace */
|a {
  text-decoration: wavy underline purple;
  font-weight: bold;
}

/* links with any namespace or no namespace */
*|a {
  font-style: italic;
  color: magenta;
  fill: magenta;
}
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Default_namespace_and_no_namespace", "100%", 100)}}

The selector with no namespace separator, the `a`, matched only the SVG `<a>` elements, as SVG was set as the default namespace.

The selector with no namespace, the `|a`, matched the JavaScript defined and appended `<a>`, as that node is the only node that doesn't have a default namespace.

# & nesting selector

The CSS **`&` nesting selector** explicitly states the relationship between parent and child rules when using [CSS nesting](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_nesting). It makes the nested child rule selectors _relative to the parent element_. Without the `&` nesting selector, the child rule selector selects child elements. The child rule selectors have the same [specificity](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_nesting/Nesting_and_specificity) weight as if they were within {{cssxref(":is", ":is()")}}.

> [!NOTE]
> _Child rule_ does not mean _child element selector_. A child rule can target parent element or child elements depending on use of the `&` nesting selector.

If not used in nested style rule, the `&` nesting selector represents the [scoping root](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:scope).

## Syntax

```css
parentRule {
  /* parent rule style properties */
  & childRule {
    /* child rule style properties */
  }
}
```

### `&` nesting selector and whitespace

Consider the following code where nesting is done _without_ the `&` nesting selector.

```css
.parent-rule {
  /* parent rule properties */
  .child-rule {
    /* child rule properties */
  }
}
```

When the browser parses the nested selectors, it automatically adds whitespace between the selectors to create a new CSS selector rule. The following code shows the equivalent non-nested rules:

```css
.parent-rule {
  /* parent rule style properties */
}

.parent-rule .child-rule {
  /* style properties for .child-rule descendants for .parent-rule ancestors */
}
```

When the nested rule needs to be attached (with no whitespace) to the parent rule, such as when using a {{cssxref('Pseudo-classes', 'pseudo-class')}} or creating [compound selectors](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_selectors/Selector_structure#compound_selector), the `&` nesting selector must be immediately prepended to achieve the desired effect.

Consider an example where we want to style an element, providing styles to be applied at all times, and also nesting some styles to be applied only on hover. If the `&` nesting selector is not included, whitespace is added and we end up with a ruleset that applies the nested styles to any _hovered descendant of the parent rule selector_. This is, however, not what we want.

```css
.parent-rule {
  /* parent rule properties */
  :hover {
    /* child rule properties */
  }
}

/* the browser parses the above nested rules as shown below */
.parent-rule {
  /* parent rule properties */
}

.parent-rule *:hover {
  /* child rule properties */
}
```

With the `&` nesting selector added with no whitespace, the elements matched by the parent rule will be styled when hovered.

```css
.parent-rule {
  /* parent rule properties */
  &:hover {
    /* child rule properties */
  }
}

/* the browser parses the above nested rules as shown below */
.parent-rule {
  /* parent rule properties */
}

.parent-rule:hover {
  /* child rule properties */
}
```

### Appending the `&` nesting selector

The `&` nesting selector can also be appended to reverse the context of the rules.

```css
.card {
  /* .card styles */
  .featured & {
    /* .featured .card styles */
  }
}

/* the browser parses above nested rules as */

.card {
  /* .card styles */
}

.featured .card {
  /* .featured .card styles */
}
```

The `&` nesting selector can be placed multiple times:

```css
.card {
  /* .card styles */
  .featured & & & {
    /* .featured .card .card .card styles */
  }
}

/* the browser parses above nested rules as */

.card {
  /* .card styles */
}

.featured .card .card .card {
  /* .featured .card .card .card styles */
}
```

### Cannot represent pseudo-elements

The `&` selector is equivalent to the {{cssxref(":is", ":is()")}} selector, and has the same limitation that it cannot represent pseudo-elements.

For example, with the following style rule, no generated content will be styled red, even when nested in `<div class="important">`, because `.important :is(.foo::before)` cannot match anything.

```css
.foo::before {
  content: "Hello";

  .important & {
    color: red;
  }
}
```

This limitation also applies to [nested at-rules](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_nesting/Nesting_at-rules), whose properties are implicitly wrapped in an `&` selector. For example, with the following rule, no generated content will be styled red, even on a small screen, because the `color: red` property is implicitly wrapped in an `&` selector, which in this case is `:is(.foo::before)`.

```css
.foo::before {
  content: "Hello";

  @media (width < 600px) {
    color: red;
  }
}
```

## Examples

Both of the following examples produce the same output. The first one uses normal CSS styles and the second one uses the `&` nesting selector.

### Using normal CSS styles

This example uses normal CSS styling.

#### HTML

```html
<p class="example">
  This paragraph <a href="#">contains a link</a>, try hovering or focusing it.
</p>
```

#### CSS

```css
.example {
  font-family: system-ui;
  font-size: 1.2rem;
}

.example > a {
  color: tomato;
}

.example > a:hover,
.example > a:focus {
  color: ivory;
  background-color: tomato;
}
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample('Original_CSS_styles','100%','65')}}

### Using `&` in nested CSS styles

This example uses nested CSS styling.

#### HTML

```html
<p class="example">
  This paragraph <a href="#">contains a link</a>, try hovering or focusing it.
</p>
```

#### CSS

```css
.example {
  font-family: system-ui;
  font-size: 1.2rem;
  & > a {
    color: tomato;
    &:hover,
    &:focus {
      color: ivory;
      background-color: tomato;
    }
  }
}
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample('Nested_CSS_styles','100%','65')}}

### Using `&` outside nested rule

If not used in nested style rule, the `&` nesting selector represents the [scoping root](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:scope).

```html
<p>Hover over the output box to change document's background color.</p>
```

```css
& {
  color: blue;
  font-weight: bold;
}

&:hover {
  background-color: wheat;
}
```

#### Result

In this case, all the styles apply to [document](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document).

# Next-sibling combinator

The **next-sibling combinator** (`+`) separates two selectors and matches the second element only if it _immediately_ follows the first element, and both are children of the same parent {{DOMxRef("element")}}.

```css
/* Paragraphs that come immediately after any image */
img + p {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

## Syntax

```css-nolint
/* The white space around the + combinator is optional but recommended. */
former_element + target_element { style properties }
```

## Examples

### Basic usage

This example demonstrates how to select the next sibling if that next sibling is of a specific type.

#### CSS

We only style the `<li>` that comes immediately after an `<li>` that is the first of its type:

```css
li:first-of-type + li {
  color: red;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

#### HTML

```html
<ul>
  <li>One</li>
  <li>Two!</li>
  <li>Three</li>
</ul>
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Basic usage", "100%", 100)}}

### Selecting a previous sibling

The next-sibling combinator can be included within the {{cssxref(":has", ":has()")}} functional selector to select the previous sibling.

#### CSS

We only style the `<li>` with a next sibling that is an `<li>` that is the last of its type:

```css
li:has(+ li:last-of-type) {
  color: red;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

#### HTML

```html
<ul>
  <li>One</li>
  <li>Two</li>
  <li>Three!</li>
  <li>Four</li>
</ul>
```

# <number>

The **`<number>`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [data type](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_and_units/CSS_data_types) represents a number, being either an integer, a number with a fractional component, or a base-ten exponent in scientific notation.

## Syntax

The syntax of `<number>` extends the syntax of {{CSSxRef("&lt;integer&gt;")}}. A fractional value is represented by a `.` followed by one or more decimal digits, and may be appended to an integer. A `<number>` can also end with the letter `e` or `E` followed by an integer, which indicates a base-ten exponent in scientific notation. There is no unit associated with numbers.

As with integers, the first character of the number can be immediately preceded by - or + to indicate the number's sign: whether the number is positive or negative.

## Interpolation

When animated, values of the `<number>` CSS data type are interpolated as real, floating-point numbers. The speed of the interpolation is determined by the [easing function](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/easing-function) associated with the animation.

## Examples

### Valid numbers

```plain example-good
12          A raw <integer> is also a <number>.
4.01        Positive fraction
-456.8      Negative fraction
0.0         Zero
+0.0        Zero, with a leading +
-0.0        Zero, with a leading -
.60         Fractional number without a leading zero
10e3        Scientific notation
-3.4e-2     Complicated scientific notation
```

### Invalid numbers

```plain example-bad
12.         Decimal points must be followed by at least one digit.
+-12.2      Only one leading +/- is allowed.
12.1.1      Only one decimal point is allowed.

# object-fit

The **`object-fit`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets how the content of a {{ glossary("replaced elements", "replaced element")}}, such as an {{HTMLElement("img")}} or {{HTMLElement("video")}}, should be resized to fit its container.

> [!NOTE]
> The `object-fit` property has no effect on {{HTMLElement("iframe")}}, {{HTMLElement("embed")}}, and {{HTMLElement("fencedframe")}} elements.

You can alter the alignment of the replaced element's content object within the element's box using the {{cssxref("object-position")}} property.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: object-fit")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
object-fit: fill;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
object-fit: contain;
```

```css interactive-example-choice

</section>
```

```css interactive-example
#example-element {
  height: 100%;

  border: 2px dotted #888888;
}
```

## Syntax

object-fit: contain;
object-fit: cover;
object-fit: fill;
object-fit: none;
object-fit: scale-down;

/* Global values */
object-fit: inherit;
object-fit: initial;
object-fit: revert;
object-fit: revert-layer;
object-fit: unset;
```

The `object-fit` property is specified as a single keyword chosen from the list of values below.

### Values

- `contain`
  - : The replaced content is scaled to maintain its {{glossary("aspect ratio")}} while fitting within the element's content box. The entire object is made to fill the box, while preserving its aspect ratio, so the object will be ["letterboxed"](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterboxing_(filming)>) or ["pillarboxed"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillarbox) if its aspect ratio does not match the aspect ratio of the box.
- `cover`
  - : The replaced content is sized to maintain its aspect ratio while filling the element's entire content box. If the object's aspect ratio does not match the aspect ratio of its box, then the object will be clipped to fit.
- `fill`
  - : The replaced content is sized to fill the element's content box. The entire object will completely fill the box. If the object's {{glossary("aspect ratio")}} does not match the aspect ratio of its box, then the object will be stretched to fit.
- `none`
  - : The replaced content is not resized.
- `scale-down`
  - : The content is sized as if `none` or `contain` were specified, whichever would result in a smaller concrete object size.

# object-position

The **`object-position`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property specifies the alignment of the selected {{ glossary("replaced elements", "replaced element")}}'s contents within the element's box. Areas of the box which aren't covered by the replaced element's object will show the element's background.

You can adjust how the replaced element's object's intrinsic size (that is, its natural size) is adjusted to fit within the element's box using the {{cssxref("object-fit")}} property.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: object-position")}}

```css interactive-example-choice

### Positioning image content

#### HTML

Here we see HTML that includes two {{HTMLElement("img")}} elements, each displaying the MDN logo.

```html
<img id="object-position-1" src="mdn.svg" alt="MDN Logo" />
<img id="object-position-2" src="mdn.svg" alt="MDN Logo" />
```

#### CSS

The CSS includes default styling for the `<img>` element itself, as well as separate styles for each of the two images.

```css
img {
  width: 300px;
  height: 250px;
  border: 1px solid black;
  background-color: silver;
  margin-right: 1em;
  object-fit: none;
}

#object-position-1 {
  object-position: 10px;
}

#object-position-2 {
  object-position: 100% 10%;
}
```

The first image is positioned with its left edge inset 10 pixels from the left edge of the element's box. The second image is positioned with its right edge flush against the right edge of the element's box and is located 10% of the way down the height of the element's box.

# object-view-box

{{CSSRef}}

The **`object-view-box`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property defines a rectangle as a viewable area (viewbox) within a {{glossary("replaced elements", "replaced element")}}, enabling the content of the replaced element to be zoomed or panned. It works similarly to the SVG {{SVGAttr("viewBox")}} attribute.

```

### Values

- `none`
  - : The element does not have a view box. This is the default.

- [`<basic-shape-rect>`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/basic-shape#basic-shape-rect)
  - : A {{cssxref("basic-shape/inset","inset()")}}, {{cssxref("basic-shape/xywh","xywh()")}}, or {{cssxref("basic-shape/rect","rect()")}} function specifying a view box for an element with natural dimensions (replaced elements). Resolves to `none` otherwise.

## Description

The `object-view-box` property can be used to crop or resize {{glossary("replaced elements")}}, including images and videos. It works by showing a section of the content of the replaced element in the available space reserved for that element. The section of the replaced element that is displayed is defined by the value of the property. The available reserved space is determined by the element's default {{glossary("extrinsic size")}}. The subsection of the content displayed can be presented zoomed-in, panned-out, or at its original size, while maintaining the content's intrinsic {{glossary("aspect ratio")}}.

The property value is a `<basic-shape-rect>`, one of the {{cssxref("basic-shape")}} functions limited to defining a rectangular shape. For example, the value can be a {{cssxref("basic-shape/xywh","xywh()")}} function:

```css
img {
  object-view-box: xywh(410px 0 400px 150px);
}
```

In this case, the top left corner of the section of the image that will be displayed is `410px` from the left edge and `0` from the top, as defined by x and y coordinate parameters. The size of the section of the original image that will be displayed is `400px` wide by `150px` tall; the `w` and `h` components of the function. This 400x150 section of the image will be displayed in the space that was reserved for the image itself when the page was laid out. Whether the content section displayed is its original intrinsic size, zoomed in, or zoomed out depends on whether the viewbox is 400px x 150px, smaller, or larger than the image element's size, respectively.

![The leopard image cropped using object-view-box property, with a 400px by 150px viewbox displaying an unscaled section of the image](https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/diagrams/css/object-view-box/object-view-box_xywh.jpg)

In this case, as the rectangular viewbox defined by the `object-view-box` property and the rectangular area of the `<img>` element are the same size, i.e., 400 x 150 pixels, the replaced element is not scaled.

Decrease the `w` and `h` values to create a zoomed-in effect; as the smaller image section is stretched, it has a zoomed-in effect.

Increase the `w` and `h` argument values to create a zoomed-out effect; as the larger image section is shrunk, it has a zoomed-out effect.

Animating the `x` and `y` coordinates creates a panning effect by moving the element's viewbox while the element itself remains in its original location.

## Examples

### Basic usage

This example demonstrates the basic usage and the effects of the `object-view-box` property, with examples using the three different `<basic-shape-rect>` functions.

#### HTML

We have three almost identical {{htmlelement("img")}} elements wrapped in {{htmlelement("figure")}} elements; the only difference is their class names.

```html
<figure>
  <img
    class="intrinsic"
    src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/painted-hand.jpg"
    alt="Original scale section of a painted hand" />
  <figcaption>intrinsic</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
  <img
    class="zoom-in"
    src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/painted-hand.jpg"
    alt="Zoomed in section of a painted hand" />
  <figcaption>zoomed in</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
  <img
    class="zoom-out"
    src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/painted-hand.jpg"
    alt="Zoomed out section of a painted hand" />
  <figcaption>zoomed out</figcaption>
</figure>
```

#### CSS

We style all the images to have the same width and height, then set each class, and therefore each image, to have a different `object-view-box` value. The intrinsic size of the painted hand image is `298px` by `332px`. We set the {{cssxref("height")}} and {{cssxref("width")}}, setting the extrinsic size to `200px` by `200px`.

```css
img {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  border: 1px solid red;
}
```

We set three different `object-view-box` property values using three different shape functions. The `intrinsic` element's {{cssxref("basic-shape/xywh","xywh()")}} function value displays a `200px` square section of the image content, starting from the `70px` from the left and `90px` from the top. The `zoom-in` element's {{cssxref("basic-shape/rect","rect()")}} function displays a `160px` square section of the original element, going from `110px` to `270px` from the top edge and `90px` to `250px` from the left edge. The `zoom-out` replaced element's {{cssxref("basic-shape/inset","inset()")}} function displays a `298px` square section of the original element; showing the entire width of the image while cutting of a 17px from the top and bottom.

```css
.intrinsic {
  object-view-box: xywh(70px 90px 200px 200px);
}

.zoom-in {
  object-view-box: rect(110px 250px 270px 90px);
}

.zoom-out {
  object-view-box: inset(17px 0 17px 0);
}
```

```css hidden
@supports not (object-view-box: none) {
  body::before {
    content: "Your browser does not support the 'object-view-box' property.";
    color: black;
    background-color: #ffcd33;
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
    text-align: center;
  }
}

figure {
  display: inline-block;
  margin: 0;
}

figcaption {
  text-align: center;
}
```

#### Results

{{ EmbedLiveSample("Basic usage", "", "300") }}

The `intrinsic` version is showing an unscaled section of the image. The `zoom-in` version is showing a smaller section (`160px` square) of the image, scaled up to fit `200px` square viewbox. As the section is stretched, it looks zoomed in. The `zoom-out` version is showing a larger (`298px` square) section of the image, scaled down to fit `200px` square viewbox. As the section is shrunk, it looks zoomed out.

### Live zoom-in using object-view-box property

This example demonstrates using the `object-view-box` property to zoom a section of a replaced element in and out, within a statically sized HTML element. In this case, the eye of the leopard, within a very large image, serves as the focal point of the zoom effect.

#### HTML

We include an {{htmlelement("img")}} element and a [`range`](Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/range) {{htmlelement("input")}} element, with an associated {{htmlelement("label")}}. The natural dimensions, or intrinsic size, of the original leopard image are `1244px` wide by `416px` tall, with an {{glossary("aspect ratio")}} of `3:1`.

```html
<img
  src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/leopard.jpg"
  alt="leopard" />
<p>
  <label for="box-size">Zoom-in: </label>
  <input type="range" id="box-size" min="115" max="380" value="150" />
</p>
<output></output>
```

#### CSS

We define a `--box-size` custom property, which is used as the height and width in the {{cssxref("basic-shape/xywh", "xywh()")}} function, creating a square viewbox with an aspect ratio of `1:1`. The view box's offset point, the focal point in our zoom effect, is set at `500px` for the `x` coordinate and `30px` for the `y` coordinate, which corresponds to the top-left corner of the leopard's right eye.

```css hidden
input {
  width: 350px;
}

output {
  text-align: center;
  background-color: #dedede;
  font-family: monospace;
  padding: 5px;
  display: block;
}

@supports not (object-view-box: none) {
  body::before {
    content: "Your browser does not support the 'object-view-box' property.";
    color: black;
    background-color: #ffcd33;
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
    text-align: center;
  }
}
```

```css
img {
  width: 350px;
  height: 350px;
  border: 2px solid red;

  --box-size: 150px;
  object-view-box: xywh(500px 30px var(--box-size) var(--box-size));
}
```

#### JavaScript

We add an event listener to the slider that updates the value of the `--boxSize` custom property when the user interacts with it. To increase the zoom-in effect when the slider is moved to the right, the slider's value is inverted by subtracting it from `500px`, as reducing the view box size increases the zoom-in effect.

```js
const img = document.querySelector("img");
const zoom = document.getElementById("box-size");
const output = document.querySelector("output");

function update() {
  const size = 500 - zoom.value;
  img.style.setProperty("--box-size", `${size}px`);
  output.innerText = `object-view-box: xywh(500px 30px ${size}px ${size}px);`;
}

zoom.addEventListener("input", update);
update();
```

#### Result

{{ EmbedLiveSample("Live zoom in using object-view-box property", "", 480) }}

Move the slider to the right to increase the zoom-in effect and left to reduce it. The slider only affects the dimensions of the view box, while the x and y values, the origin point of the viewbox, remain constant. The size of the `<img>` element doesn't change either.

### Panning using the object-view-box property

This example demonstrates panning an image by animating the `object-view-box` property value.

#### HTML

The HTML includes a single image.

```html
<img
  src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/leopard.jpg"
  alt="leopard" />
```

#### CSS

We define an image size and keep the viewbox dimensions, the `w` and `h` components of the `xywh()` function, constant, as we animate the top and left positions, changing the position of the `x` and `y` parameters over five seconds.

```css
img {
  width: 350px;
  height: 350px;

  object-view-box: xywh(0 30px 400px 400px);

  animation: panning 5s linear infinite alternate;
}

@keyframes panning {
  from {
    object-view-box: xywh(0 -50px 400px 400px);
  }
  to {
    object-view-box: xywh(800px 68px 400px 400px);
  }
}
```

```css hidden
@supports not (object-view-box: none) {
  body::before {
    content: "Your browser does not support the 'object-view-box' property.";
    color: black;
    background-color: #ffcd33;
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
    text-align: center;
  }
}
```

# offset-anchor

The **`offset-anchor`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property specifies the point inside the box of an element traveling along an {{cssxref("offset-path")}} that is actually moving along the path.

    button.textContent = "Play";
  } else {
    example.classList.add("running");
    button.textContent = "Pause";
  }
});
```

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword values */
offset-anchor: top;
offset-anchor: bottom;
offset-anchor: left;
offset-anchor: right;
offset-anchor: center;
offset-anchor: auto;

/* <percentage> values */

/* Global values */
offset-anchor: inherit;
offset-anchor: initial;
offset-anchor: revert;
offset-anchor: revert-layer;
offset-anchor: unset;
```

### Values

- `auto`
  - : `offset-anchor` is given the same value as the element's {{cssxref("transform-origin")}}, unless {{cssxref("offset-path")}} is `none`, in which case it takes its value from {{cssxref("offset-position")}}.
- `<position>`
  - : A {{cssxref("&lt;position&gt;")}} defines an x/y coordinate, to place an item relative to the edges of an element's box. It can be defined using one to four values. For more specifics, see the {{cssxref("&lt;position&gt;")}} and {{cssxref("background-position")}} reference pages. Note that the 3-value position syntax does not work for any usage of `<position>`, except for in `background(-position)`.

## Examples

### Setting various offset-anchor values

In the following example, we have three {{htmlelement("div")}} elements nested in {{htmlelement("section")}} elements. Each `<div>` is given the same {{cssxref("offset-path")}} (a horizontal line 200 pixels long) and animated to move along it. The three are then given different {{cssxref("background-color")}} and `offset-anchor` values.

Each `<section>` has been styled with a linear gradient to give it a horizontal line running through its center, to give you a visual display of where the `<div>`'s offset paths are running.

This allows you to see what effect the different `offset-anchor` values have — the first one, `auto`, causes the `<div>`'s center point to move along the path. The other two cause the `<div>`'s top-right and bottom-left points to move along the path, respectively.

#### HTML

```html
<section>
  <div class="offset-anchor1"></div>
</section>
<section>
  <div class="offset-anchor2"></div>
</section>
<section>
  <div class="offset-anchor3"></div>

### Using offset-distance in an animation

The motion aspect in CSS Motion Path typically comes from animating the `offset-distance` property. If you want to animate an element along its full path, you would define its {{cssxref('offset-path')}} and then set up an animation that takes the `offset-distance` from `0%` to `100%`.

<div id="motion-demo"></div>
```

#### CSS

```css
#motion-demo {
  offset-path: path("M20,20 C20,100 200,0 200,100");
  animation: move 3000ms infinite alternate ease-in-out;

# offset-path

The **`offset-path`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property specifies a path for an element to follow and determines the element's positioning within the path's parent container or the SVG coordinate system. The path is a line, a curve, or a geometrical shape along which the element gets positioned or moves.

The `offset-path` property is used in combination with the {{cssxref("offset-distance")}}, {{cssxref("offset-rotate")}}, and {{cssxref("offset-anchor")}} properties to control the position and orientation of the element along a path.

### Values

The `offset-path` property takes as its value an `<offset-path>` value, a [`<coord-box>`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-edge#values) value, or both, or the `none` keyword. The `<offset-path>` value is a {{cssxref("ray","ray()")}} function, a {{cssxref("url_value", "&lt;url&gt;")}} value, or a [`<basic-shape>`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/basic-shape) value.

- `none`
  - : Specifies that the element does not follow any offset path. The `none` value is equivalent to the element not having any [offset transform](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/offset). The element's movement in this case is determined by its default position properties, such as {{cssxref("top")}} and {{cssxref("left")}}, instead of an offset path. This is the default value.

- `<offset-path>`
  - : A `ray()` function, a `<url>` value, or a `<basic-shape>` value that specifies the geometrical offset path. If omitted, the path shape for the `<coord-box>` value is `inset(0 round X)`, where `X` is the value of {{cssxref("border-radius")}} of the element that establishes the [containing block](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Containing_block).
    - {{cssxref("ray","ray()")}}
      - : Defines a line starting at a set position, of a set length, and extending at the specified angle. The `ray()` function accepts up to four parameters – an {{CSSxRef("angle")}}, an optional size value, the optional keyword `contain`, and an optional `at <position>`.

    - {{cssxref("url_value", "&lt;url&gt;")}}
      - : Specifies the ID of an [SVG shape element](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorials/SVG_from_scratch/Basic_shapes). The path is the shape of the SVG {{SVGElement("circle")}}, {{SVGElement("ellipse")}}, {{SVGElement("line")}}, {{SVGElement("path")}}, {{SVGElement("polygon")}}, {{SVGElement("polyline")}}, or {{SVGElement("rect")}} element referenced by its `id` in the `url()` function. If the URL does not reference a shape element or is otherwise invalid, the resolved value for the offset path is `path("M0,0")` (which is a valid `<basic-shape>` value).

    - {{cssxref("basic-shape")}}
      - : Specifies the offset path as the equivalent path of a [CSS basic shape function](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/basic-shape), such as {{cssxref("basic-shape/circle","circle()")}}, {{cssxref("basic-shape/ellipse","ellipse()")}}, {{cssxref("basic-shape/inset","inset()")}}, {{cssxref("basic-shape/path","path()")}}, {{cssxref("basic-shape/polygon","polygon()")}}, {{cssxref("basic-shape/rect","rect()")}}, or {{cssxref("basic-shape/xywh","xywh()")}}. For example, if the `<basic_shape>` is an `ellipse()` function, then the path is the outline of the ellipse, starting at the rightmost point of the ellipse, proceeding clockwise through a full rotation. For `ellipse()` and `circle()`, which accept the `at <position>` parameter, if the `<position>` is omitted, the position defaults to `center` unless the element has an {{cssxref("offset-position")}} specified. In this case, the `offset-position` value is used for the `at <position>` parameter. More complex shapes can be defined using the {{cssxref("basic-shape/shape","shape()")}} function.

- [`<coord-box>`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-edge#values)
  - : Specifies the size information of the [reference box](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_shapes/Basic_shapes#the_reference_box) containing the path. The reference box is derived from the element that establishes the containing block for this element. This parameter is optional. If not specified, the default value is `border-box` in CSS contexts. In SVG contexts, the value is treated as `view-box`. If `ray()` or `<basic-shape>` is used to define the offset path, the `<coord-box>` value provides the reference box for the ray or the `<basic-shape>`, respectively. If `<url>` is used to define the offset path, the `<coord-box>` value provides the viewport and user coordinate system for the shape element, with the origin (`0 0`) at the top left corner and size being `1px`.

## Description

The `offset-path` property defines a path an animated element can follow. An offset path is either a specified path with one or multiple sub-paths or the geometry of a not-styled basic shape. The element's exact position on the offset path is determined by the {{cssxref("offset-distance")}} property. Each shape or path must define an initial position for the computed value of `0` for {{cssxref("offset-distance")}} and an initial direction which specifies the rotation of the object to the initial position.

Early versions of the spec called this property `motion-path`. It was changed to `offset-path` because the property describes static positions, not motion.

## Examples

### Creating an offset-path using box-edge positioning

This example demonstrates using various `<coord-box>` values in the `offset-path` property.

```html hidden
<div class="box blueBox"></div>
<div class="box redBox"></div>
<div class="box greenBox"></div>
```

```css hidden
body {
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  border-radius: 50px;
  border: dashed aqua;
  border-width: 25px;
  padding: 25px;
  margin: 50px;
}
```

```css
.box {
  width: 40px;
  height: 20px;
  animation: move 8000ms infinite ease-in-out;
}

.blueBox {
  background-color: blue;
  offset-path: border-box;
  offset-distance: 5%;
}

.greenBox {
  background-color: green;
  offset-path: padding-box;
  offset-distance: 8%;
}

.redBox {
  background-color: red;
  offset-path: content-box;
  offset-distance: 12%;
}

@keyframes move {
  0%,
  20% {
    offset-distance: 0%;
  }
  80%,
  100% {
    offset-distance: 100%;
  }
}
```

In this example, the margin, border, and padding have been purposely given large values to demonstrate the placement of the blue, green, and red rectangles on their respective `<coord-box>` edges: border-box, padding-box, and content-box.

![The blue rectangle sits on the outer edge of the border box, the green rectangle is on the inner border edge, which is the outer edge of the padding box, and the red rectangle is on the outer edge of the content box.](offset-path-coord-box.png)

### Creating an offset-path using path()

In this example, the {{svgelement("svg")}} element creates a house with a chimney and also defines two halves of a scissor. The house and chimney are composed of rectangles and polygons, and the scissor halves are represented by two distinct path elements. In the CSS code, the `offset-path` property is used to specify a path to follow for the two scissor halves. This CSS-defined path is identical to the one represented by the `<path>` element in the SVG, which is the outline of the house including the chimney.

```html live-sample___offset_path_path

}

@keyframes move {

  }
  to {
    offset-distance: 100%;
  }
}

@keyframes rotate-left {
  0% {
    offset-rotate: auto 0deg;
  }
  50% {
    offset-rotate: auto -45deg;
  }
  100% {

  }
}

@keyframes rotate-right {

  }
  50% {
    offset-rotate: auto 45deg;
  }
  100% {
    offset-rotate: auto 0deg;
  }
}
```

#### Result

Without the `offset-path` property, the two halves of the scissors would default to the top-left corner of the canvas. However, by using `offset-path`, the two scissor halves are aligned with the starting point of the SVG path, allowing them to move along it.

### Creating an offset-path using url()

This example illustrates how to refer to an SVG shape to define the shape of the path that an element can follow. The green circle (defined by `.target`) follows the path of a rectangle, which is defined by passing the SVG shape's ID (`svgRect`) to the `offset-path` property by using `url()`.

The SVG rectangle that defines the path shape is shown here only to visually demonstrate that the green circle is indeed following the path defined by this rectangle.

```html live-sample___offset_path_url
<div class="outer">
  <div class="target"></div>
</div>
<svg width="400" height="200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect id="svgRect" x="50" y="50" width="200" height="100" />
</svg>
```

```css hidden live-sample___offset_path_url
.outer {
  position: absolute;
}
```

```css live-sample___offset_path_url
.target {
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background-color: green;
  offset-path: url("#svgRect");
  offset-anchor: auto;
  animation: move 5s linear infinite;
}

#svgRect {
  fill: antiquewhite;
  stroke: black;
  stroke-width: 2;
}

@keyframes move {
  0% {
    offset-distance: 0%;
  }
  100% {
    offset-distance: 100%;
  }
}
```

# offset-position

The **`offset-position`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property defines the initial position of an element along a path. This property is typically used in combination with the {{cssxref("offset-path")}} property to create a motion effect. The value of `offset-position` determines where the element gets placed initially for moving along an offset path if an `offset-path` function such as {{cssxref("basic-shape/path", "path()")}} does not specify its own starting position.

The `offset-position` property is part of a motion system based on {{cssxref("offset")}} constituent properties, including {{cssxref("offset-anchor")}}, {{cssxref("offset-distance")}}, and `offset-path`. These properties work together to create various motion effects along a path.

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword values */
offset-position: normal;
offset-position: auto;
offset-position: top;
offset-position: bottom;
offset-position: left;
offset-position: right;
offset-position: center;

/* <percentage> values */
offset-position: 25% 75%;

/* <length> values */
offset-position: 0 0;
offset-position: 1cm 2cm;
offset-position: 10ch 8em;

/* Edge offsets values */
offset-position: bottom 10px right 20px;
offset-position: right 3em bottom 10px;
offset-position: bottom 10px right;
offset-position: top right 10px;

/* Global values */
offset-position: inherit;
offset-position: initial;
offset-position: revert;
offset-position: revert-layer;
offset-position: unset;
```

### Values

- `normal`
  - : Indicates that the element does not have an offset starting position and places the element at `50% 50%` of the containing block. This is the default value.
- `auto`
  - : Indicates that the offset starting position is the top-left corner of the element's box.
- {{cssxref("&lt;position&gt;")}}
  - : Specifies the position as an x/y coordinate to place an element relative to its box edges. The position can be defined using one to four values. If two non-keyword values are used, the first value represents the horizontal position and the second represents the vertical position. If only one value is specified, the second value is assumed to be `center`. If three or four values are used, the {{cssxref("length-percentage")}} values are offsets for the preceding keyword value(s). For more explanation of these value types, see {{cssxref("background-position")}}.

## Examples

### Setting initial offset-position for an offset-path

In this example, the {{cssxref("offset-path")}} property is used to define the path along which the `cyan` element should move. The value of the {{cssxref("basic-shape/path", "path()")}} CSS function is an [SVG data path](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/d) that describes a curved path. The element moves along this curved path during the `move` animation.

### Comparing various offset starting positions

This example visually compares various initial offset starting position of an element when {{cssxref("ray", "ray()")}} is used to specify a value for the {{cssxref("offset-path")}} property. The number inside the element box indicates the element to which CSS is applied as well as the element's anchor point.

```html hidden
<div class="wrap">
  <div class="box">0</div>
  <div class="box box0">0</div>
  <pre>
    offset-position: normal;
    /* No offset-path specified */
  </pre>
</div>

<div class="wrap">

  <div class="box box1">1</div>
  <pre>
    offset-position: normal;

  <div class="box box2">2</div>
  <pre>
    offset-position: auto;
    offset-path: ray(0deg);
  </pre>
</div>

<div class="wrap">

  <div class="box box3">3</div>
  <pre>
    offset-position: left top;

}

pre {

}

.box {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;

  height: 50px;
}

.box + .box {

}
```

```css
.box {

  border-top: 6px dashed white;
  background-clip: border-box;
  position: absolute;
  top: 20px;
  left: 20px;
  opacity: 20%;
  color: white;
}

  offset-position: normal;
}

.box1 {
  offset-position: normal;
  offset-path: ray(0deg);
}

.box2 {
  offset-position: auto;
  offset-path: ray(0deg);
}

.box3 {
  offset-position: left top;
  offset-path: ray(0deg);
}

.box4 {
  offset-position: 30% 70%;
  offset-path: ray(120deg);
}
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample('Comparing various offset starting positions', '100%', 930)}}

In `box0`, the absence of the `offset-path` property means that an `offset-position` of either `normal` or `auto` has no effect. When `offset-position` is `normal`, the ray starts at the center of the containing block (i.e., `50% 50%`). This is the default starting position of an offset path and is used when no `offset-position` is specified. Notice the difference between offset starting positions `auto` and `left top`. The value `auto` aligns the element's anchor point to its own top-left corner, whereas the value `left top` aligns the element's anchor point to the top-left corner of the containing block.

# offset-rotate

The **`offset-rotate`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property defines the orientation/direction of the element as it is positioned along the {{cssxref("offset-path")}}.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: offset-rotate")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
offset-rotate: auto;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
offset-rotate: 90deg;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
offset-rotate: auto 90deg;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
offset-rotate: reverse;
```

```html interactive-example
<section class="default-example" id="default-example">
  <div class="transition-all" id="example-element"></div>
  <button id="playback" type="button">Play</button>
</section>
```

```css interactive-example
#example-element {

  } else {
    example.classList.add("running");
    button.textContent = "Pause";
  }
});
```

> [!NOTE]
> Early versions of the spec called this property `motion-rotation`.

## Syntax

```css
/* Follow the path direction, with optional additional angle */
offset-rotate: auto;
offset-rotate: auto 45deg;

/* Follow the path direction but facing the opposite direction of `auto` */
offset-rotate: reverse;

/* Keep a constant rotation regardless the position on the path */
offset-rotate: 90deg;
offset-rotate: 0.5turn;

/* Global values */
offset-rotate: inherit;
offset-rotate: initial;
offset-rotate: revert;
offset-rotate: revert-layer;
offset-rotate: unset;
```

- `auto`
  - : The element is rotated by the angle of the direction of the {{cssxref("offset-path")}}, relative to the positive x-axis. This is the default value.
- {{cssxref("&lt;angle&gt;")}}
  - : The element has a constant clockwise rotation transformation applied to it by the specified rotation angle.
- `auto <angle>`
  - : If `auto` is followed by an {{cssxref("&lt;angle&gt;")}}, the computed value of the angle is added to the computed value of `auto`.
- `reverse`
  - : The element is rotated similar to `auto`, except it faces the opposite direction. It is the same as specifying a value of `auto 180deg`.

# offset

The **`offset`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [shorthand property](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Shorthand_properties) sets all the properties required for animating an element along a defined path. The offset properties together help to define an _offset transform_, a [transform](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_transforms/Using_CSS_transforms) that aligns a point in an element ([offset-anchor](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/offset-anchor)) to an _offset position_ ([offset-position](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/offset-position)) on a path ([offset-path](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/offset-path)) at various points along the path ([offset-distance](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/offset-distance)) and optionally rotates the element ([offset-rotate](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/offset-rotate)) to follow the direction of the path.

> [!NOTE]
> Early versions of the spec called this property `motion`.

# opacity

The **`opacity`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets the opacity of an element. Opacity is the degree to which content behind an element is hidden, and is the opposite of transparency.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: opacity")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
opacity: 0;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
opacity: 0.33;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
opacity: 1;
```

```html interactive-example
<section class="default-example" id="default-example">
  <p id="example-element">
    London. Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting in
    Lincoln's Inn Hall. Implacable November weather. As much mud in the streets
    as if the waters had but newly retired from the face of the earth, and it
    would not be wonderful to meet a Megalosaurus, forty feet long or so,
    waddling like an elephantine lizard up Holborn Hill.
  </p>
</section>
```

```css interactive-example
#example-element {
  background-color: #963770;
  color: white;
  padding: 1em;
}
```

## Syntax

```css
opacity: 0.9;
opacity: 90%;

/* Global values */
opacity: inherit;
opacity: initial;
opacity: revert;
opacity: revert-layer;
opacity: unset;
```

### Values

- `<alpha-value>`
  - : A {{cssxref("number")}} in the range `0.0` to `1.0`, inclusive, or a {{cssxref("percentage")}} in the range `0%` to `100%`, inclusive, representing the opacity of the channel (that is, the value of its alpha channel). Any value outside the interval, though valid, is clamped to the nearest limit in the range.

    | Value                                                  | Meaning                                                                       |
    | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `0`                                                    | The element is fully transparent (that is, invisible).                        |
    | Any {{cssxref("number")}} strictly between `0` and `1` | The element is translucent (that is, content behind the element can be seen). |
    | `1` (default value)                                    | The element is fully opaque (visually solid).                                 |

## Description

`opacity` applies to the element as a whole, including its contents, even though the value is not inherited by child elements. Thus, the element and its children all have the same opacity relative to the element's background, even if they have different opacities relative to one another.

To change the opacity of a background only, use the {{cssxref("background")}} property with a [color value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) that allows for an alpha channel. For example:

```css
background: rgb(0 0 0 / 40%);
```

When `opacity` value is set to `0`, the element and all of its children appear invisible, but they are still part of the DOM. That means they still register [pointer events](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events) and, if the elements are in a tabbing order, they do get focus. For good usability, make sure to make such elements visible when they receive user interactions or use the CSS [`pointer-events`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events) property to disable pointer events and take the element out of the tab order by disabling with the `disabled` attribute or setting [`tab-index="-1"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/tabindex) for non-form-related interactive elements.

Using `opacity` with a value other than `1` places the element in a new [stacking context](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_positioned_layout/Stacking_context).

Opacity alone should not be used to provide information to screen readers. Use the HTML [`hidden`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/hidden) attribute, CSS [`visibility`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/visibility), or CSS [`display`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) style properties. It's best to avoid using [`aria-hidden`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-hidden) attribute, but if the element is hidden with opacity, then hide it from screen readers as well.

### Transitioning opacity

When [transitioning](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_transitions) the opacity of elements as you add them to the page when content was formerly hidden with [`visibility: hidden`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/visibility#hidden), [`display: none`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display#none), or [`content-visibility: hidden`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content-visibility#hidden), you need to include both a [`@starting-style`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@starting-style) and [`transition-behavior: allow-discrete`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition-behavior#allow-discrete):

```css
.card {
  transition:
    opacity 5s,
    display 5s;
  background-color: orange;

  transition-behavior: allow-discrete;
  @starting-style {
    opacity: 0;
  }
}

.card.hidden {
  display: none;
  opacity: 0;
}
```

To enable first-style transitions, `@starting-style` rules are needed. In the above code, setting `opacity: 0` in `@starting-style` provides a starting point for the transition when the element receives its initial style update. For more details, see [`@starting-style`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@starting-style).

Setting `transition-behavior: allow-discrete` is required to transition to `display: none`. See the [`transition-behavior`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition-behavior) property for more details.

## Accessibility

If text opacity is adjusted, it is important to ensure that the contrast ratio between the color of the text and the background the text is placed over is high enough that people experiencing low vision conditions will be able to read the content of the page.

Color contrast ratio is determined by comparing the luminosity of the opacity-adjusted text and background color values. In order to meet current [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/), a ratio of 4.5:1 is required for text content and 3:1 for larger text such as headings. Large text is defined as 18.66px and [bold](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight) or larger, or 24px or larger.

- [Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.3 | W3C Understanding WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html)

Various operating systems provide a preference for reducing transparency. To set the `opacity` based on the user's operating systems transparency preferences, use the [`prefers-reduced-transparency`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-transparency) media query.

## Examples

### Setting opacity

The following example demonstrates how the `opacity` property changes the opacity of the entire element and content, thus making the text very hard to read.

#### HTML

```html
<div class="light">You can barely see this.</div>
<div class="medium">This is easier to see.</div>
<div class="heavy">This is very easy to see.</div>
```

#### CSS

```css
div {
  background-color: yellow;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 130%;
}
.light {
  opacity: 0.2; /* Barely see the text over the background */
}
.medium {
  opacity: 0.5; /* See the text more clearly over the background */
}
.heavy {
  opacity: 0.9; /* See the text very clearly over the background */
}
```

#### Result

### Setting opacity on hover

In the following example opacity is changed on hover, so the striped background image on the parent element shows through the image.

#### HTML

```html
<div class="wrapper">
  <img
    src="/shared-assets/images/examples/dino.svg"
    alt="MDN Dino"
    width="128"
    height="146"
    class="opacity" />
</div>
```

#### CSS

```css
img.opacity {
  opacity: 1;
}

img.opacity:hover {
  opacity: 0.5;
}

.wrapper {
  width: 200px;
  height: 160px;
  background-color: #f03cc3;
  background-image: linear-gradient(
    90deg,
    transparent 50%,
    rgb(255 255 255 / 50%) 50%
  );
  background-size: 20px 20px;
}
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample('Setting_opacity_on_hover', '150', '200')}}

### Styling based on user preferences

To style elements based on user's operating systems transparency preferences, use the [`prefers-reduced-transparency`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-transparency) media query. The following example demonstrates how to use the `prefers-color-scheme` media query to specify the desired `opacity` based on the user's preferences.

```css
.element {
  opacity: 0.5;
}

@media (prefers-reduced-transparency) {
  .element {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
```

# order

The **`order`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets the order to lay out an item in a flex or grid container. Items in a container are sorted by ascending `order` value and then by their source code order. Items not given an explicit `order` value are assigned the default value of `0`.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: order")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
order: 0;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
order: 3;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
order: -1;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
order: 2;
```

```html interactive-example
<section class="default-example" id="default-example">
  <div class="transition-all" id="example-element">Box 1:</div>
  <div style="order: 1">Box 2: <code>order: 1;</code></div>
  <div style="order: 2">Box 3: <code>order: 2;</code></div>
  <div style="order: 2">Box 4: <code>order: 2;</code></div>
  <div style="order: 3">Box 5: <code>order: 3;</code></div>
</section>
```

```css interactive-example
.default-example {
  max-height: 300px;
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: column;
}

.default-example > div {
  background-color: rgb(0 0 255 / 0.2);
  border: 3px solid blue;
  margin: 0.5rem;
  padding: 0.5rem;
  flex: 1;
}

#example-element {
  background-color: rgb(255 0 200 / 0.2);
  border: 3px solid rebeccapurple;
}

#example-element::after {
  content: attr(style);
  outline: 2px dashed;
  font-family: monospace;
}
```

In the above demo, select the options on the left-hand side to change the value of the pink box's `order` property. The light blue boxes have been given fixed `order` values.

Bear in mind the effect of source order. For example, when `order: 2;` is selected, the pink box is placed before the two blue boxes with `order: 2;`. This is because the pink box appears before the blue boxes in the source code.

## Syntax

```css
/* <integer> values */
order: 5;
order: -5;

/* Global values */
order: inherit;
order: initial;
order: revert;
order: revert-layer;
order: unset;
```

Since `order` is only meant to affect the _visual order_ of elements and not their logical or tab order, it must not be used on non-visual media such as [speech](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-speech/).

Defined in the [CSS display](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display) module, this property impacts only grid and flex items. When `order` is set on an element whose parent's {{cssxref("display")}} property is not creating a flex or grid container, it has no effect.

### Values

- {{cssxref("&lt;integer&gt;")}}
  - : Represents the ordinal group to be used by the item.

## Accessibility

Using the `order` property will create a disconnect between the visual presentation of content and DOM order. This will adversely affect low vision users navigating with the aid of assistive technology such as a screen reader. If the visual order differs from the DOM order, your users will have different experiences depending on how they access your content.

## Examples

### Ordering items in a flex container

In this example, we create a classic two-sidebar layout.

#### HTML

We include a header, a footer, and a main content area. The main content includes an article and two side bars. Note their order! We'll use the CSS `order` property to change their visual order.

```html
<header>Header</header>
<main>
  <article>Article</article>
  <nav>Nav</nav>
  <aside>Aside</aside>
</main>
<footer>Footer</footer>
```

#### CSS

We style the main area using [flexible box layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout) module features; by setting {{cssxref("display")}} to `flex`, the {{htmlelement("main")}} element becomes a flex container. By default, this creates flex items of equal vertical size. The sidebars are both given an absolute {{cssxref("width")}}, while the {{htmlelement("article")}} will consume all the [positive free space](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Controlling_ratios_of_flex_items_along_the_main_axis#positive_and_negative_free_space) with a {{cssxref("flex-grow")}} factor set via the {{cssxref("flex")}} shorthand.

We then set different `order` property values on each of the flex container's three children; this means the CSS is defining that component's visual order rather than it appearing in the order declared in the HTML.

```css
main {

# orphans

The **`orphans`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets the minimum number of lines in a block container that must be shown at the _bottom_ of a [page](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_paged_media), region, or [column](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_multicol_layout).

In typography, an _orphan_ is the first line of a paragraph that appears alone at the bottom of a page. (The paragraph continues on a following page.)

## Syntax

```css
/* <integer> values */
orphans: 2;
orphans: 3;

/* Global values */
orphans: inherit;
orphans: initial;
orphans: revert;
orphans: revert-layer;
orphans: unset;
```

### Values

- {{cssxref("&lt;integer&gt;")}}
  - : The minimum number of lines that can stay by themselves at the bottom of a fragment before a fragmentation break. The value must be positive.

# outline-color

The **`outline-color`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets the color of an element's outline.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: outline-color")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
outline-color: red;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
outline-color: #32a1ce;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
outline-color: rgb(170 50 220 / 0.6);
```

```css interactive-example-choice
outline-color: hsl(60 90% 50% / 0.8);
```

```css interactive-example-choice
outline-color: currentColor;
```

```html interactive-example
<section class="default-example" id="default-example">
  <div class="transition-all" id="example-element">
    This is a box with an outline around it.
  </div>
</section>
```

```css interactive-example
#example-element {
  outline: 0.75em solid;
  padding: 0.75em;
  width: 80%;
  height: 100px;
}
```

## Syntax

```css
/* <color> values */
outline-color: #f92525;
outline-color: rgb(30 222 121);
outline-color: blue;

/* Global values */
outline-color: inherit;
outline-color: initial;
outline-color: revert;
outline-color: revert-layer;
outline-color: unset;
```

The `outline-color` property is specified as any one of the values listed below.

### Values

- {{cssxref("&lt;color&gt;")}}
  - : The color of the outline, specified as a `<color>`.

The specification also lists an additional value, `auto`, which is not currently supported in any browsers. When implemented, `auto` will compute to [`currentColor`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#currentcolor_keyword) unless [`outline-style`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/outline-style) is set to `auto` then it will compute to the [accent color](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/accent-color).

## Description

An outline is a line that is drawn around an element, outside the {{cssxref("border")}}. Unlike the element's border, the outline is drawn outside the element's frame, and may overlap other content. The border, on the other hand, will actually alter the page's layout to ensure that it fits without overlapping anything else (unless you explicitly set it to overlap).

It is often more convenient to use the shorthand property {{cssxref("outline")}} when defining the appearance of an outline.

## Accessibility

Custom [focus styles](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus) commonly involve making adjustments to the {{cssxref("outline")}} property. If the color of the outline is adjusted, it is important to ensure that the contrast ratio between it and the background the outline is placed over is high enough that people experiencing low vision conditions will be able to perceive it.

Color contrast ratio is determined by comparing the luminosity of the text and background color values. In order to meet current [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/), a ratio of 4.5:1 is required for text content and 3:1 for larger text such as headings. Large text is defined as 18.66px and [bold](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight) or larger, or 24px or larger.

# outline-offset

The **`outline-offset`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets the amount of space between an [outline](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/outline) and the edge or border of an element.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: outline-offset")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
outline-offset: 4px;

  border: 2px solid crimson;
  outline: 0.75em solid;

outline-offset: 0.2em;

/* Global values */
outline-offset: inherit;
outline-offset: initial;
outline-offset: revert;
outline-offset: revert-layer;
outline-offset: unset;
```

### Values

- {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}}
  - : The width of the space between the element and its outline. A negative value places the outline inside the element. A value of `0` places the outline so that there is no space between it and the element.

## Description

An outline is a line that is drawn around an element, outside the border edge. The space between an element and its outline is transparent. In other words, it is the same as the parent element's background.

/* Global values */
outline-style: inherit;
outline-style: initial;
outline-style: revert;
outline-style: revert-layer;
outline-style: unset;
```

The `outline-style` property is specified as any one of the values listed below.

### Values

- `auto`
  - : Permits the user agent to render a custom outline style.
- `none`
  - : No outline is used. The {{cssxref("outline-width")}} is `0`.
- `dotted`
  - : The outline is a series of dots.
- `dashed`
  - : The outline is a series of short line segments.
- `solid`
  - : The outline is a single line.
- `double`
  - : The outline is two single lines. The {{cssxref("outline-width")}} is the sum of the two lines and the space between them.
- `groove`
  - : The outline looks as though it were carved into the page.
- `ridge`
  - : The opposite of `groove`: the outline looks as though it were extruded from the page.
- `inset`
  - : The outline makes the box look as though it were embedded in the page.
- `outset`
  - : The opposite of `inset`: the outline makes the box look as though it were coming out of the page.

# outline

The **`outline`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [shorthand property](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Shorthand_properties) sets most of the outline properties in a single declaration.

{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: outline")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
outline: solid;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
outline: dashed red;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
outline: 1rem solid;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
outline: thick double #32a1ce;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
outline: 8px ridge rgb(170 50 220 / 0.6);
border-radius: 2rem;
```

```html interactive-example
<section class="default-example" id="default-example">
  <div class="transition-all" id="example-element">
    This is a box with an outline around it.
  </div>
</section>
```

```css interactive-example
#example-element {
  padding: 0.75rem;
  width: 80%;
  height: 100px;
}
```

## Constituent properties

This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:

- {{cssxref("outline-width")}}
- {{cssxref("outline-style")}}
- {{cssxref("outline-color")}}

## Syntax

```css
/* style */
outline: solid;

/* style | color */
outline: dashed #ff6666;

/* width | style */
outline: thick inset;

/* width | style | color*/
outline: 3px solid green;

/* Global values */
outline: inherit;
outline: initial;
outline: revert;
outline: revert-layer;
outline: unset;
```

The `outline` property may be specified using one, two, or three of the values listed below. The order of the values does not matter. As with all shorthand properties, any omitted sub-values will be set to their [initial value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Value_processing#initial_value).

> [!NOTE]
> The outline will be invisible for many elements if its style is not defined. This is because the style defaults to `none`. A notable exception is `input` elements, which are given default styling by browsers.

### Values

- `<'outline-width'>`
  - : Sets the thickness of the outline. Defaults to `medium` if absent. See {{cssxref("outline-width")}}.
- `<'outline-style'>`
  - : Sets the style of the outline. Defaults to `none` if absent. See {{cssxref("outline-style")}}.
- `<'outline-color'>`
  - : Sets the color of the outline. Defaults to `invert` for browsers supporting it, `currentColor` for the others. See {{cssxref("outline-color")}}.

## Description

Outline is a line outside of the element's [border](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border). Unlike other areas of the box, outlines don't take up space, so they don't affect the layout of the document in any way.

There are a few properties that affect an outline's appearance. It is possible to change the style, color, and width using the `outline` property, the distance from the border using the {{cssxref("outline-offset")}} property, and corner angles using the {{cssxref("border-radius")}} property.

An outline is not required to be rectangular: While dealing with multiline text, some browsers will draw an outline for each line box separately, while others will wrap the whole text with a single outline.

## Accessibility

Assigning `outline` a value of `0` or `none` will remove the browser's default focus style. If an element can be interacted with it must have a visible focus indicator. Provide obvious focus styling if the default focus style is removed.

# overflow-anchor

The **`overflow-anchor`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property provides a way to opt out of the browser's scroll anchoring behavior, which adjusts scroll position to minimize content shifts.

Scroll anchoring behavior is enabled by default in any browser that supports it. Therefore, changing the value of this property is typically only required if you are experiencing problems with scroll anchoring in a document or part of a document and need to turn the behavior off.

# overflow-block

The **`overflow-block`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets what shows when content overflows the block start and block end edges of a box. This may be nothing, a scroll bar, or the overflow content.

> [!NOTE]
> The `overflow-block` property maps to {{Cssxref("overflow-y")}} or {{Cssxref("overflow-x")}} depending on the writing mode of the document.

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword values */
overflow-block: visible;
overflow-block: hidden;
overflow-block: clip;
overflow-block: scroll;
overflow-block: auto;

/* Global values */
overflow-block: inherit;
overflow-block: initial;
overflow-block: revert;
overflow-block: revert-layer;
overflow-block: unset;
```

The `overflow-block` property is specified as a single {{CSSXref("overflow_value", "&lt;overflow&gt;")}} keyword value:

### Values

- `visible`
  - : Content is not clipped and may be rendered outside the padding box's block start and block end edges.
- `hidden`
  - : Content is clipped if necessary to fit the block dimension in the padding box. No scrollbars are provided.
- `clip`
  - : Overflow content is clipped at the element's overflow clip edge that is defined using the {{CSSXref("overflow-clip-margin")}} property.
- `scroll`
  - : Content is clipped if necessary to fit in the block dimension in the padding box. Browsers display scrollbars whether or not any content is actually clipped. (This prevents scrollbars from appearing or disappearing when the content changes.) Printers may still print overflowing content.
- `auto`
  - : Depends on the user agent. If content fits inside the padding box, it looks the same as `visible`, but still establishes a new block-formatting context.

### HTML

```html
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>overflow-block: hidden</code> (hides the text outside the box)
    <div id="hidden">

    </div>
  </li>

  <li>
    <code>overflow-block: scroll</code> (always adds a scrollbar)

    </div>
  </li>

  <li>
    <code>overflow-block: clip</code> (hides the text outside the box beyond the
    overflow clip edge)

    </div>
  </li>

  <li>
    <code>overflow-block: visible</code> (displays the text outside the box if
    needed)
    <div id="visible">

  <li>
    <code>overflow-block: auto</code> (on most browsers, equivalent to
    <code>scroll</code>)
    <div id="auto">

# overflow-clip-margin

The **`overflow-clip-margin`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property determines how far outside its bounds an element with [`overflow: clip`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow) may be painted before being clipped. The bound defined by this property is called the _overflow clip edge_ of the box.

## Syntax

```css
/* <length> values */
overflow-clip-margin: 20px;
overflow-clip-margin: 1em;

/* <visual-box> | <length> */
overflow-clip-margin: content-box 5px;

/* Global values */
overflow-clip-margin: inherit;
overflow-clip-margin: initial;
overflow-clip-margin: revert;
overflow-clip-margin: revert-layer;
overflow-clip-margin: unset;
```

The `<visual-box>` value, which defaults to `padding-box`, specifies the box edge to use as the overflow clip edge origin. The {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}} value specified in `overflow-clip-margin` must be nonnegative.

> [!NOTE]
> If the element does not have `overflow: clip` then this property will be ignored.
