  },
  {
    "question": "How does the browser generate the information used by screen readers?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What properties are typically found in an accessibility tree object?",
    "answer": "An accessibility tree object typically contains four properties: name (how to refer to the object), description (additional context), role (what kind of thing it is, e.g., button), and state (current condition, e.g., checked or collapsed)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the precedence order for computing an element's accessible description?",
    "answer": "The accessible description is computed in this order: `aria-describedby`, `aria-description`, language-specific features (like `<summary>` inside `<details>`), and finally the `title` attribute if not used for the accessible name. If none are defined, the description is empty."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is an element's accessible name calculated if it has both visible content and an `aria-label`?",
    "answer": "The accessible name calculation depends on the element, but `aria-label` generally overrides visible content. For example, if an element has `aria-label`, that value is used. If not, it may derive the name from visible content (like button text) or associated elements (like a label)."
