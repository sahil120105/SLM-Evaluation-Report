It looks like you may be using an old version of VS Code, the latest stable release is 1.104.2. Please try upgrading to the latest version and checking whether this issue remains.\n\nHappy Coding!\n---\n\nUser 'aconradi' said:\n---\nI have tried with the latest version of VSCode and with VSCode insiders and I can reproduce the issue there as well.\n---\n\nUser 'bpasero' said:\n---\nI cannot reproduce, is this involving a remote connection somehow?\n---\n\nUser 'aconradi' said:\n---\nNo, this is locally on my Windows machine. It also happens with remote connections to a Linux machine. So for me whenever VSCode decides to open a new window to edit the new file the `--wait` breaks. I haven't been able to suss out why `code` sometimes opens the file in the existing window you run it from and sometimes opens the file in the same window. For me `C:\\temp\\some-file` always triggers the opening of a new window, but `../other-dir/some-file` does not trigger a new window.\n\nI can also reproduce this by starting a stand-alone Windows terminal running git-bash and running `code --wait /c/temp/some-file` from that terminal. VSCode then first selects some open VSCode window, tries to use it and then decides to create a new window and then the `code --wait` commands returns before I get a chance to edit the file.\n\nWhen I do this with VSCode Insider and an empty insider window already open I also get the, but then I first get a dialog that asks if I want to open the file in restricted mode or not, where I select to open it in restricted mode.\n\nIs there something more I can do to try to find why my VSCode behaves in this strange manner?\n---\n\nUser 'bpasero' said:\n---\nLet's see if any one else is seeing this issue to see if this is related to VS Code (i.e. can be fixed) or a setup problem with your system.\n---\n\nUser 'aconradi' said:\n---\nI also tried this at home on my Mac and I run into the same problem there. When VSCode opens the new window for the file due to it being opened in restricted mode, the `code --wait` command returns immediately.\n---\n\nUser 'bpasero' said:\n---\n@aconradi so this issue only occurs when restricted mode is also involved?\n---\n\nUser 'aconradi' said:\n---\n@bpasero Yes, I don't understand how restricted mode works, but I think that is true. The new window seems to always be in restricted mode.\n---\n\nUser 'bpasero' said:\n---\nI can reproduce now, this needs quite a specific flow to trigger the issue:\n* you need to open a file that is in an untrusted folder\n* from the dialog you need to pick \"Open in Restricted Mode\"\n* this will force open a new window because the current one is restricted\n\n=> \ud83d\udc1b the `--wait` is not working in this case\n\n<img width=\"607\" height=\"385\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/301a37ab-9d98-4e11-a1eb-0eec8116fbc3\" />\n---\n\nUser 'bpasero' said:\n---\nThis is actually very hard for us to implement because we have logic in this case that expects the editors to open in the current window and then track when the editor closes:\n\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/0ff74c1fde922954585bc8619203ab8ebe6ade93/src/vs/workbench/electron-browser/window.ts#L1023-L1039\n\nAs part of the flow though, because of workspace trust, we open in a new window, which is something we only decide within that window, which is too late to track properly. \n\nI think the complexity of the fix does not warrant the effort here, the workaround is to trust the file so that it opens in the current window, given you explicitly stated the file path from the command line.\n---\n\nUser 'aconradi' said:\n---\nThanks for all the feedback! I now have a work-around for this. I had previously configured vscode to not trust all these external files, so I didn\u2019t get any prompt, things just failed silently. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t run this manually. My actual use-case is using jj and using code as the editor for commit messages. Jj puts the files for the commit messages in temp and not in the workspace.\n\nSo for now I have configured vscode to trust all files since I don\u2019t want this prompt every time I edit a commit message.\n---"}

Do I need to be on that in order to use this feature?\n---\n\nUser 'Tyriar' said:\n---\nYes on older versions of Windows this is less reliable as the terminal emulation provided by Windows ends up reprinting the screen, causing the phrase to show up again.\n---\n\nUser 'Snailedlt' said:\n---\nShouldn't this be fixed for Windows 10 too though? It's still supported by Microsoft and VSCode, right?\n---\n\nUser 'Regenhardt' said:\n---\nSo is the conclusion just \"Not supported you gotta disable it on Windows 10 yourself\" and case closed? Doesn't seem right.\n---\n\nUser 'Regenhardt' said:\n---\nOk I see you disabled it by default in a merge request. So the state is now \"this isn't supported on Windows 10\"?\r\n\r\nHow about this:\r\n\r\nCurrently it seems to go \"if (buffer.Contains(trigger)) send(reply);\"  \r\nSo what if instead it goes \"if (buffer.Contains(trigger) && !buffer.Contains(trigger+reply)) send(reply);\"\r\n\r\nYou know, just check if the line that was found already has a reply?\n---\n\nUser 'bballweiss' said:\n---\nThanks for the reply.

Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\nIt seems like \"Always allow exact command line\" allows a lot more than the exact command line. I noticed this just now:\n\n<img width=\"279\" height=\"84\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/701071fb-7b97-4c67-900d-8271d2b5500e\" />\n\nClicking through to my config it contains:\n```json\n  \"npm run build\": {\n      \"approve\": true,\n      \"matchCommandLine\": true\n  }\n```\n\nIf I'm reading this correctly, copilot could do anything in the world after that && and it would automatically run.\nPossible solutions: strict line matching as an option (Always allow exact command line vs Always allow exact command vs Always allow command), or split commands by logical seperators like &&, and require that each part is approved before running. \n\n- Copilot Chat Extension Version: latest\n- VS Code Version: latest\n- OS Version: Win 11 latest\n- Feature (e.g. agent/edit/ask mode): Agent\n- Selected model (e.g. GPT 4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet): Any / GPT-5\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1. \"Always allow exact command\" on a copilot command\n2. Later, have copilot run that command followed by && and another command", "response": "The issue was addressed with the following discussion:\n\nUser 'kylegrover' said:\n---\n<img width=\"278\" height=\"170\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e1c687b-ac5b-4600-8b55-c3e51819596c\" />\n\nThis looks like it is doing multiple parsing with `|` or `||`, but clicking through I don't see these in my auto-approve settings, I suppose they're default: true? The @id:chat.tools.terminal.autoApprove text says that both sides of the && should require approval as well, so maybe my initial interaction was a bug?\n---\n\nUser 'Tyriar' said:\n---\nYou're matching the _command line_ here, as opposed to sub-commands within the command line:\n\n```\n  \"npm run build\": {\n      \"approve\": true,\n      \"matchCommandLine\": true\n  }\n```\n\nThat means that if the command line (`npm run build && <whatever>`) starts with `npm run build`, it will be auto approved. Don't set `matchCommandLine` and you'll get the behavior you want.\n---\n\nUser 'kylegrover' said:\n---\nI'm still confused by this, I didn't actually edit the json. Was this a result of pressing \"Always Allow Exact Command Line\" instead of \"Always Allow Command\"? Ie does choosing the option with \"Exact\" in it make the matching less exact?\n---\n\nUser 'Tyriar' said:\n---\nYou're right there is a bug here, fix coming soon\n---"}

As a result, much of the content extends beyond the visible area, and users must scroll horizontally to view the entire response. This makes it difficult to read and interact with long outputs.\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\nThe response window should automatically wrap long lines so that all content remains visible without requiring horizontal scrolling.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n1. Trigger Copilot to generate a long response in the VS Code extension.\n2. Observe that the response window does not wrap text, and horizontal scrolling is required to view the full content.\n\n**Environment:**\n\n- VS Code version: 1.102.3\n- Copilot Chat Extension Version: 0.29.1\n- Copilot extension version: 1.350.0\n- OS: Windows 11\n\nThank you!", "response": "The issue was addressed with the following discussion:\n\nUser 'justschen' said:\n---\ni suspect this is because of the language. we'll take a look, thanks!\n---\n\nUser 'megamorphg' said:\n---\n> i suspect this is because of the language\n\nI have this happening with AutoHotkey code too, so I think it's also programming language specific\n\nEdit: nevermind!

Instead we just hope to open up the entire model management feature to Copilot Business and Copilot enterprise soon. This is something we actively continuely to think about and may create a special case for the Copilot models\n---"}

{"instruction": "A user reported the following issue titled 'MCP OAuth authentication fails to retry after server restart when scopes unchanged' in the 'microsoft/vscode' repository. Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\nThe source of the problem: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/3ec367371fdb761eaf951bfeeb9b68b61272d21c/src/vs/workbench/api/common/extHostMcp.ts#L735\n\n### Summary\nVS Code's MCP client fails to retry OAuth authentication after server restarts when the OAuth scopes remain the same, leading to permanent connection failures until VS Code is restarted.\n\n### Environment\n- VS Code version: Latest (1.104.3)\n- Extension: Model Context Protocol (MCP) built-in support\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Set up an MCP server with OAuth authentication using in-memory token storage\n2. Connect VS Code to the server and complete OAuth flow successfully\n3. Restart the MCP server (invalidating all stored tokens)\n4. VS Code attempts to reconnect using cached token\n5. Server responds with 401 and same WWW-Authenticate scopes as before\n\n### Expected Behavior\nVS Code should detect the 401 response and initiate a fresh OAuth flow to obtain a new valid token.\n\n### Actual Behavior\nVS Code gives up after the second 401 response and marks the connection as failed with \"Server exited before responding to `initialize` request.\"\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\nThe issue is in the `_fetchWithAuthRetry` method in `McpHTTPHandle` ([source](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vs/workbench/api/common/extHostMcp.ts)):\n\n```typescript\n} else {\n    // We have auth metadata, but got a 401. Check if the scopes changed.\n    const { scopesChallenge } = this._parseWWWAuthenticateHeader(res);\n    if (!scopesMatch(scopesChallenge, this._authMetadata.scopes)) {\n        // Only retries here if scopes are different\n        this._authMetadata.scopes = scopesChallenge;\n        await this._addAuthHeader(headers);\n        // ... retry logic\n    }\n    // NO RETRY if scopes match but token is invalid!\n}\n```\n\n**Problem**: VS Code assumes that if OAuth scopes haven't changed, the cached token should still be valid. It doesn't account for server restarts that invalidate tokens while keeping scopes the same.\n\n### Logs\nVS Code client logs show:\n```\n[trace] Fetching http://localhost:3000/mcp (initial request)\n[trace] Fetched: {\"status\":401} (no auth header)\n[trace] Fetching http://localhost:3000/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server \n[trace] Fetched: {\"status\":200} (discovery successful)\n[trace] Fetching http://localhost:3000/mcp with \"Authorization\":\"***\"\n[trace] Fetched: {\"status\":401} (cached token rejected)\n[info] Connection state: Error 401 status\n[error] Server exited before responding to `initialize` request.\n```\n\n\n### Proposed Solution\nThe `_fetchWithAuthRetry` method should have a fallback when scopes match but authentication fails:\n\n```typescript\n} else {\n    // We have auth metadata, but got a 401. Check if the scopes changed.\n    const { scopesChallenge } = this._parseWWWAuthenticateHeader(res);\n    if (!scopesMatch(scopesChallenge, this._authMetadata.scopes)) {\n        this._log(LogLevel.Debug, `Scopes changed, updating and retrying`);\n        this._authMetadata.scopes = scopesChallenge;\n\n...

It looks like you may be using an old version of VS Code, the latest stable release is 1.104.3. Please try upgrading to the latest version and checking whether this issue remains.\n\nHappy Coding!\n---\n\nUser 'justinbmeyer' said:\n---\nSorry, I was on the latest stable release: 1.104.3.  I asked Copilot to write up this issue. Didn't review enough! Updating the main text. This bug is in 1.104.3.\n---\n\nUser 'justinbmeyer' said:\n---\nAlso, in case it's useful, I found this problem while building this mcp training exercise: https://github.com/bitovi/mcp-training\n\nThe MCP server worked with claude and mcp-inspector, but not VSCode.  You can see the handlers here: https://github.com/bitovi/mcp-training/blob/main/src/auth/oauth-handlers.ts\n\nOriginally, I tried to make everything work with `@node-oauth/express-oauth-server`. However, VSCode has another spec bug that I had to address here: https://github.com/bitovi/mcp-training/blob/main/src/auth/oauth-handlers.ts#L237\n\nVSCode uses `resource_metadata_url` where the spec is `resource_metadata`\n---\n\nUser 'justinbmeyer' said:\n---\nIf folks are looking for a workaround, you can create a dynamic scope that forces the comparison to fail:\n\n```\n  const serverInstanceScope = `server-instance-${serverStartTime.getTime()}`;\n  let authValue = `Bearer realm=\"mcp\", scope=\"${serverInstanceScope}\"`;\n```\n---\n\nUser 'TylerLeonhardt' said:\n---\n@justinbmeyer \n\n> Root Cause Analysis\n\nthe code you've linked isn't live yet. It's in tomorrow's Insiders build. Have you tried this command?:\n```\n>Authentication: Remove Dynamic Authentication Providers\n```\n\n> VSCode uses resource_metadata_url where the spec is resource_metadata\n\nWhere do you see this?\n---\n\nUser 'justinbmeyer' said:\n---\nI didn't try that command. I didn't know it existed.  I'll try it Monday when I'm back to work on this.\n\n\n> Where do you see this? ( resource_metadata_url )\n\nI didn't see that in the code.  I saw this behavior as the only way to get the discovery endpoint to work correctly with VSCode.  I saw this a few weeks ago and have adopted this pattern since on multiple MCP services.  I can double check it's still happening with latest.\n---\n\nUser 'TylerLeonhardt' said:\n---\n@justinbmeyer what does your MCP Server return when an invalid token is provided? I'm thinking about how I can take you through the auth flow automatically.\n---\n\nUser 'TylerLeonhardt' said:\n---\nI'm gonna try and redo auth registrations on 401s and see how that goes. So long as your MCP Server returns a 401 when it gets an invalid token, it should go through the flow.\n---"}

Your job is to assist users in using Visual Studio Code by providing knowledge to accomplish their task. This knowledge should focus on settings, commands, keybindings but also includes documentation. \nWhen asked for your name, you must respond with \"GitHub Copilot\".\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\nAdditional Rules\nIf a command or setting references another command or setting, you must respond with both the original and the referenced commands or settings.\nPrefer a setting over a command if the user's request can be achieved by a setting change.\nIf answering with a keybinding, please still include the command bound to the keybinding.\nIf a keybinding contains a backtick you must escape it. For example the keybinding Ctrl + backtick would be written as ``ctrl + ` ``\nIf you believe the context given to you is incorrect or not relevant you may ignore it.\nAlways respond with a numbered list of steps to be taken to achieve the desired outcome if multiple steps are necessary.\nIf an extension might help the user, you may suggest a search query for the extension marketplace. You must also include the command **Search marketplace** (`workbench.extensions.search`) with args set to the suggested query in the commands section at the end of your response. The query can also contain the tags \"@popular\", \"@recommended\", or \"@featured\" to filter the results.\nThe user is working on a Mac machine. Please respond with system specific commands if applicable.\nIf a command or setting is not a valid answer, but it still relates to Visual Studio Code, please still respond.\nIf the question is about release notes, you must also include the command **Show release notes** (`update.showCurrentReleaseNotes`) in the commands section at the end of your response.\nIf the response includes a command, only reference the command description in the description. Do not include the actual command in the description.\nAll responses for settings and commands code blocks must strictly adhere to the template shown below:\n<responseTemplate>\n```json\n{\n\t\"type\": \"array\",\n\t\"items\": {\n\t\"type\": \"object\",\n\t\"properties\": {\n\t  \"type\": {\n\t\t\"type\": \"string\",\n\t\t\"enum\": [\"command\", \"setting\"]\n\t  },\n\t  \"details\": {\n\t\t\"type\": \"object\",\n\t\t\"properties\": {\n\t\t  \"key\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n\t\t  \"value\": { \"type\": \"string\" }\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"required\": [\"key\"]\n\t  }\n\t},\n\t\"required\": [\"type\", \"details\"],\n\t\"additionalProperties\": false\n\t}\n}\n```\nwhere the `type` is either `setting`, `command`.\n- `setting` is used for responding with a setting to set.\n- `command` is used for responding with a command to execute\nwhere the `details` is an optional object that contains the setting/command objects.\n- `key` is the setting | command value to use .\n- `value` is the setting value in case of a setting.\n- `value` is the optional arguments to the command in case of a command.\n\n</responseTemplate>\n<examples>\nBelow you will find a set of examples of what you should respond with.

Under a `# Question` header, output a rephrased version of the user's question that resolves all pronouns and ambiguous words like 'this' to the specific nouns they stand for.\nIf it is not clear what the user is asking for or if the question appears to be unrelated to Visual Studio Code, do not try to rephrase the question and simply return the original question. \nDO NOT ask the user for additional information or clarification.\nDO NOT answer the user's question directly.\n\n# Additional Rules\n\n2. If the question contains pronouns such as 'it' or 'that', try to understand what the pronoun refers to by looking at the rest of the question and the conversation history.\n3. If the question contains an ambiguous word such as 'this', try to understand what 'this' refers to by looking at the rest of the question and the conversation history.\n4. After a `# Question` header, output a precise version of the question that resolves all pronouns and ambiguous words like 'this' to the specific nouns they stand for. Be sure to preserve the exact meaning of the question.\n\nExamples\n\nUser: opne cmmand palete\n\nAssistant:\n# Question\nCommand to open command palette\n\n\nUser: How do I change change font size in the editor?\n\nAssistant:\n# Question\nCommand or setting to change the font size in the editor\n\nUser: What is the setting to move editor and pin it\nAssistant: \n# Question\nSettings to move and pin editor\n\nUser: latest released features\n\nAssistant:\nrelease_notes@latest\n\nUser: What are the recent changes?\n\nAssistant:\nrelease_notes@last3\n\nUser: set up python\n\nAssistant:\n# Other Question\nSet up python development in Visual Studio Code\n\nUser: Show me popular extensions\n\nAssistant:\nvscode_extensions\n\nUser: How do I contribute a command to my extension?\n\nAssistant:\nvscode_api\n\n\n~~~\n\n### User\n~~~md\nwhen I run this notebook cell, I get this warning in the cell output. how can I supress this warning?\n\n.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/openpyxl/worksheet/_reader.py:223: UserWarning: Cell G5 is marked as a date but the serial value 20250613120000.0 is outside the limits for dates.

Tagging `@ vscode` is only for asking for information about doing things in VS Code itself, like changing a VS Code setting or running a VS Code command, rather than about changing something in your file itself. So, next time, you might want to skip tagging vscode unless your question is specifically about that.\n---\n\nUser 'jruales' said:\n---\nFixed with https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat/pull/1258\n---"}

Open a vscode workspace with many tests (in my case ~150,000)\n2. Wait for the language extension to discover all the tests in the project. In my case this is done by C# Dev Kit, though I doubt this matters.\n3. switching between code editor tabs takes a full second for vscode to become responsive again.\n\nI profiled the extension host while it was hanging, which show practically 0% CPU usage.\n\nNext, I profiled the main window.

E.g. switching between Markdown files is slow too. Though, switching to e.g. the \"Settings\" tabs doesn't have this problem, presumably because it isn't a code editor.\n- The delay is the same regardless of whether the open file contains any tests or not.\n- I have the Test Gutter disabled, so AFAIK, there no need to be computing this information in the first place.\n- Observation as someone not familiar with this codebase all: I notice the [code in question](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/4fb4fc90310a408a4f5c6216372e634634ae8ea0/src/vs/workbench/contrib/testing/browser/testingDecorations.ts#L517-L526) already \"spawns\" an `async` function to prev\n...

Do I need a specific version of vscode for this option?\n\nWith verbose output the CLI gets stuck at\n```\nTRACE #120: https://main.vscode-cdn.net/extensions/marketplace.json - begin GET Im { b: {}, a: [Object: null prototype] {} }\n```\n---\n\nUser 'deepak1556' said:\n---\n@sandy081 do we use Node.js network stack for the `--update-extensions` requests from cli or does it use the same chromium network stack as the extensions UI  ?\n---\n\nUser 'sandy081' said:\n---\nits CLI so I suppose it uses Node.js network stack\n---\n\nUser 'deepak1556' said:\n---\nAh that would explain the difference in results\n\n@SteveCoding125 can you try the following with node.js >= v22 and share the output\n\n```\nNODE_DEBUG=\"net\" node /Applications/Visual\\ Studio\\ Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/out/cli.js --update-extensions\n```\n---\n\nUser 'SteveCoding125' said:\n---\nI have run this with node.js v24.9.0, and I got the following output. The last part keeps repeating until I stop the process.\n\n[output.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22685976/output.txt)\n---\n\nUser 'deepak1556' said:\n---\nThanks for the log, couple of things\n\n1) the current timeout to autoselect between families is 250ms\n2) the default result order is ipv6 and then ipv4 \n\nSo I believe either of these should address the issue, can you confirm the request completes\n\n```\nNODE_DEBUG=\"net\" node --network-family-autoselection-attempt-timeout=10 /Applications/Visual\\ Studio\\ Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/out/cli.js --update-extensions\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nNODE_DEBUG=\"net\" node --dns-result-order=ipv4first /Applications/Visual\\ Studio\\ Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/out/cli.js --update-extensions\n```\n---\n\nUser 'SteveCoding125' said:\n---\nThis was a bit weird:\n\n`--dns-result-order=ipv4first` worked immediately with ipv6 is enabled: [output-fixed.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22687646/output-fixed.txt)\n\n `--network-family-autoselection-attempt-timeout=10` produced the same output as no flags. I wanted to take a look at the timing of the log output because I noticed, that I wouldn't get any more logs after about 30s (even when running for 5+ minutes). After running with this flag 5-10 times it suddenly worked with ipv6 enabled.\nI have tried running this a few more times and found this:\nNormally I get this output\n```\nNET 36764: connect/multiple: attempting to connect to 2620:1ec:29:1::67:443 (addressType: 6)\nNET 36764: connect/multiple: setting the attempt timeout to 10 ms\nNET 36764: connect/multiple: connection attempt to 2620:1ec:29:1::67:443 completed with status 0\nNET 36764: afterConnect\nNET 36764: _read - n 16384 isConnecting? false hasHandle? true\nNET 36764: Socket._handle.readStart\nNET 36764: _onTimeout\nNET 36764: destroy\nNET 36764: close\nNET 36764: close handle\nNET 36764: _onTimeout\n...\n```\nBut *sometimes* when I run with this flag I get the following:\n```\nNET 31152: connect/multiple: attempting to connect to 2620:1ec:bdf::44:443 (addressType: 6)\nNET 31152: connect/multiple: setting the attempt timeout to 10 ms\nNET 31152: connect/multiple: connection to 2620:1ec:bdf::44:443 timed out\nNET 31152: connect/multiple: attempting to connect to 13.107.246.44:443 (addressType: 4)\nNET 31152: connect/multiple: setting the attempt timeout to 10 ms\nNET 31152: connect/multiple: connection attempt to 13.107.246.44:443 completed with status 0\nNET 31152: afterConnect\nNET 31152: _read - n 16384 isConnecting? false hasHandle? true\n...\n```\nWith this output, the updates works.\n\nThis looks like, there is a check to see whether IPv6 works, this comes back as 'all good', but when trying to download the necessary files, the connection times out and won't switch to IPv4. But sometimes this first check fails, a fallback to IPv4 is done and everything works.\n---\n\nUser 'asnas-achu' said:\n---\n[]()\n---\n\nUser 'deepak1556' said:\n---\n> This looks like, there is a check to see whether IPv6 works, this comes back as 'all good', but when trying to download the necessary files, the connection times out and won't switch to IPv4.\n\nAh yes, the fallback only happens when the initial connection attempt fails. If that succeeds then a timeout down in the socket will not retry.\n\nRunning with `--dns-result-order=ipv4first` for the cli should be a good first change for this issue, we already do that for Node.js network usages in the extension host.\n---"}

Once this bug is fixed we will be able to do that. Alternative is that manually editing the Edit does not send any event? And we just count the explicit Reject ones?\n\nConnor - while on the topic, let me know if you have better ideas for metrics to use here. Joe Binder will share in Redmond standup next what metrics we are looking into right now.\n---\n\nUser 'connor4312' said:\n---\nI know @hediet did a bunch of work on the ARC metric for NES and we discussed getting that pipeline into normal agent edits too, I think that would be more ideal\n---\n\nUser 'isidorn' said:\n---\n@connor4312 we do have those metrics. And those metrics help us figure out the \"commit survival\". \n\nNow in addition to that metric we are exploring explicit Rejects. As a supplementary metric.\nBut maybe as a supplementary metric if you start editing code no Reject should actually be fired. \n\nIt might turn out that this supplementary metric is not useful, but we can not know that until we get our hands dirty with the data.

I've tried unlocking the local transitive to latest (4.24.4 or whatever) and installing global 4.24.4. This reproduces the node 161 error message. I've tried almost every version over 4.7.0 and all of them throw errors. I've tried installing those latest versions with `npm -g` instead of yarn and it didn't help. I've tried using latest react-devtools with node v16 as well as node v13, with react-devtools installed globally inside of each of those particular node versions and that didn't help either.\r\n\r\nMy conclusion is that despite react-native `0.65.2` specifying a transitive `^4.6.0` the reality is that it only supports `4.7.0` and lower. Given that this is an older version of RN, I doubt that they're going to make a patch release to fix this. So perhaps the ball is in the DevTools team's court to make react devtools > 4.7.0 backwards compatible? \r\n\r\nThanks for reading!\n---\n\nUser 'bvaughn' said:\n---\nThanks for the follow up info. I suspect 4.13.1 is maybe a bad lead though, in terms of when the bug was \"introduced\"\u00a0\u2013 because that version included #21426 (which basically made DevTools stop silently swallowing certain types of Store errors). In other words, 4.13.0 (and older) were probably also broken but in a less obvious way.\n---\n\nUser 'shamilovtim' said:\n---\nYou're right @bvaughn it was just swallowing the error and neither the profiler tab nor the component tab were working. I've now isolated to no errors whatsoever. I did it by locking react native's transitive `react-devtools-core` to `4.7.0` (rather than ^4.6.0) and installed global devtools with `yarn global add react-devtools@4.7.0.` The break happens between `react-devtools` 4.7.0...4.8.0. I suspect React Native has not locked to the correct transitive version, which is why you guys can't reproduce this. They just need to remove the `^` from their transitive dependency on react-devtools-core in package.json. For backwards compat the fix is probably between those two versions. I'll update my previous comment to point here.\r\n\r\n4.7.0 success, both components and profiler working:\r\n<img width=\"1500\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-04-19 at 8 52 58 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3495974/164125518-13ac42f2-f501-4669-a442-144a693783c8.png\">\n---\n\nUser 'bvaughn' said:\n---\nInteresting!

Note that React requires that components and hooks are pure functions of props and state. Reading external mutable values \u2014 such as `test.get(..)` in your example \u2014 violates this requirement and can cause your component to update (or fail to update). The example code would also fail with standard memoization, eg `useMemo(() => test.get(id), [test, id])` would only update when `test` or `id` changes. In this way, you can think about the compiler as yet another tool for detecting places where you're violating the rules of React. \n\nIs there a specific library that you're using which encourages this pattern?\n---\n\nUser 'mecirt' said:\n---\nNo library, no, this is a simplified version of our internal code that we are currently porting from class components to functional ones. I will note that this issue also occurs if you pass \"test\" as a prop - the compiler doesn't detect that calling test.set alters the value returned by test.get.\n---\n\nUser 'josephsavona' said:\n---\nThanks for clarifying!\n\n> the compiler doesn't detect that calling test.set alters the value returned by test.get.\n\nYup, that\u2019s expected. In React, component props and hook arguments may not be mutated. The way to model this in React is to use state, and setState with a new value on change.\n---\n\nUser 'mecirt' said:\n---\nWell, it has worked perfectly fine until now (and it continues to work fine after you disable the compiler), and so I imagine that this is going to trip up a lot of projects. I was at least lucky in that my component was fairly small, debugging an error of this kind on something big might be quite a nightmare.\n\nI don't know how feasible it is, but such a major behavioral change really needs to show a warning at the very least, same as e.g. hooks show one if you try to use them in a class component.\n---\n\nUser 'marcocondrache' said:\n---\n@mecirt React always expects components to be pure functions, which is a fundamental requirement. This is a constraint that the compiler respects. Just because it works doesn't mean it is correct. Implementing a warning to detect side effects in a function is not as straightforward as it may seem. \n\nhttps://react.dev/learn/keeping-components-pure\n---\n\nUser '0xShubhamSolanki' said:\n---\nI agree with @marcocondrache that enforcing purity is core to React's model, and the compiler is essentially surfacing a latent issue in the code. That said, @mecirt makes a fair point about migration pains for larger codebases transitioning from class components, where side effects like this might have slipped through without immediate breakage.\nTo mitigate this, you could consider wrapping the mutable state in a React-friendly way, such as using a context provider with useState or useReducer to manage the test object's data. This ensures changes trigger proper re-renders without violating purity.  \nFor example (rough sketch):\n```jsx \n import { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';\n\nconst TestContext = createContext();\n\nfunction TestProvider({ children }) {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(new Map());\n\n  const get = (id) => data.get(id) || '';\n  const set = (id, val) => setData((prev) => new Map(prev).set(id, val));\n\n  return <TestContext.Provider value={{ get, set }}>{children}</TestContext.Provider>;\n}\n\n// In your component\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const { get, set } = useContext(TestContext);\n  const value = get(1);\n\n  // ... rest of component\n}  `\n\nThis way, updates via set will cause re-renders where needed, and the compiler should handle it correctly. If this pattern is widespread in your codebase, auditing with eslint-plugin-react-compiler might help flag similar spots early.\nCurious if the team has plans for more diagnostics in the compiler for common anti-patterns like this?\n---\n\nUser 'josephsavona' said:\n---\n> Curious if the team has plans for more diagnostics in the compiler for common anti-patterns like this?\n\nWe already detest direct mutation of props, such as `props.key = \u2026` or `props.foo[\u2018bar\u2019] = \u2026`. We can\u2019t realistically check within arbitrary functions that you call during render - this is why from the earliest days of React we have stressed that props and state should be immutable. \n\nI\u2019m gonna close since there isn\u2019t really any additional action we take here.\n---"}

Since then, `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` has been in a state of confusion:\n\n* The version tagged as \"latest\" on npm is still `5.2.0`, which is incompatible with ESLint v9.\n* The version tagged as \"rc\" is `6.0.0-rc.2`. `6.0.0` was published (accidentally?) and is in a broken state, and is deprecated with `This stable release was published by accident, please use 6.0.0-rc.1 instead.`. The problem is that package managers will tell you to install `6.0.0` because it considered as newer than any rc version. This is frustrating as people might accidentally \"upgrade\" to the deprecated version when they update their deps.\n* Since April various versions of the plugin have been released tagged as \"next\" and \"canary\", but not all of them contain the `react-hooks/react-compiler` rule. For example, [`@nkzw/eslint-config`](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/eslint-config) currently uses `6.1.0-canary-914319ae-20250423` which has the compiler rules, and the latest canary [`6.1.0-canary-df38ac9a-20250926`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/v/6.1.0-canary-df38ac9a-20250926?activeTab=code) have them too, but the last time I checked about two weeks ago, the canaries didn't have it.\n* In some of the newer canary versions, [this code was failing](https://playground.react.dev/#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).

If you install `^6.0.0-rc.2`, then ask your package manager which packages are outdated, it will tell you to upgrade to `6.0.0`. If you automatically update your deps (using `<package-manager> update` or similar), the package manager will upgrade to `^6.0.0`, so even if you want to downgrade back to `^6.0.0-rc.2`, it will stay on `6.0.0` because the lockfile in the same project will already resolve to the \"newer\" version.\n\nWhen deprecating a package version it is best to suggest to users to upgrade to a later version, not an earlier one.\n---\n\nUser 'poteto' said:\n---\nClosing since 6.1.1 was released\n---"}

As background, see my answer at https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/34172#issuecomment-3211280685 for why the compiler works as it does. In your example, the compiler doesn\u2019t know the type of `jobs` and assumes it\u2019s an arbitrary mutable value, such that the later `jobs.map(\u2026)` could be mutating that value. In other words, it isn\u2019t that the compiler can do \u201cbetter\u201d than the developer, it\u2019s that the compiler isn\u2019t sure if the manual memoization is safe or not. \n\nThere is also some discussion of this at https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/34289\n\nAs I mentioned in the latter - this is an area with difficult tradeoffs and no best answer.

This differs from state variables, which do cause a re-render when changed.

The only reason you'd get too many re-renders is if the input value is constantly changing. But if the input value is constantly changing, then what does \"using the previous value\" even mean? It would just be whatever value you happened to render with, and not indicate any kind of meaningful semantic change.\r\n\r\nIt would really help to step back and understand what exactly you're trying to achieve with `usePrevious`. What are you trying to do? More context would help.\n---\n\nUser 'mpressmar' said:\n---\nWe are also using this usePrevious hook implementation frequently. The purpose of its returned value is not to be accessed during render but within a `useEffect` hook for a more fine-grained control of how to react to which changes.\r\n\r\nAs an example, let's say a useEffect should perform logic only when an entry has been pushed into an array:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    const previousList = usePrevious(list);\r\n    useEffect(() => {\r\n        if (previousList && previousList.length < list.length) {\r\n            // ...\r\n        }\r\n    }, [previousList, list]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe hook is also useful when a hook has other variables as dependencies but should react differently to their changes or ignore their changes overall (while still using their most recent version). For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    const previousA = usePrevious(a);\r\n    const previousB = usePrevious(b);\r\n    useEffect(() => {\r\n        if (a !== previousA) {\r\n            onUpdateA(a, b);\r\n        }\r\n       if (b !== previousB) {\r\n           onUpdateB(a, b);\r\n       }\r\n    }, [a, previousA, b, previousB, onUpdateA, onUpdateB]);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth of the usages I mentioned above can be expressed differently with a `useRef` but imho with worse readability.\n---\n\nUser 'Lonli-Lokli' said:\n---\nIs there safe implementation for [useIsFirstRender](https://github.com/antonioru/beautiful-react-hooks/blob/master/src/useIsFirstRender.ts)? \r\n\r\nThis is so strange that React is forcing everyone to change their code for no reason...

When the compiler bails out due to a rule of React violation, it leaves it untouched.\r\n\r\nWhile `useIsFirstRender` or `usePrevious` will not be compiled, it would not prevent a component elsewhere that uses that hook from being compiled.\n---\n\nUser 'eduter' said:\n---\n> We are also using this usePrevious hook implementation frequently. The purpose of its returned value is not to be accessed during render but within a `useEffect` hook for a more fine-grained control of how to react to which changes.\n\n@mpressmar I was trying to solve the same problem and came up with this hook. It only accesses `ref.current` within effects, but still allows your effects to access the previous values of all its dependencies.\n\n```ts\n/**\n * Similar to useEffect, but also provides the previous values of the\n * dependencies so that you have more control over when you run your\n * side effects.\n *\n * NOTE: To make sure you don't forget to add dependencies to your\n *   useEffectWithPrevious, add the following to your eslint config:\n *     \"react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\": [\n *       \"warn\",\n *       { \"additionalHooks\": \"useEffectWithPrevious\" }\n *     ],\n */\nfunction useEffectWithPrevious<T extends DependencyList>(\n    effect: (prevDeps: T | []) => void | Destructor,\n    deps: [...T]\n) {\n    const prevDepsRef = useRef<T>();\n    const stableEffect = useRef(effect);\n\n    useEffect(() => {\n        stableEffect.current = effect;\n    }, [effect]);\n\n    useEffect(() => {\n        const prevDeps = prevDepsRef.current;\n\n        if (!prevDeps || deps.some((dep, i) => !Object.is(dep, prevDeps[i]))) {\n            stableEffect.current(prevDeps ?? []);\n            prevDepsRef.current = deps;\n        }\n    });\n}\n\ntype Destructor = () => void;\n```\n\nSample usage:\n```ts\nuseEffectWithPrevious(\n    ([previousList]) => {\n        if (previousList && previousList.length < list.length) {\n            onListIncrease(list);\n        }\n    },\n    [list, onListIncrease]\n);\n\nuseEffectWithPrevious(\n    ([previousA, previousB]) => {\n        if (a !== previousA) {\n            onUpdateA(a, b);\n        }\n        if (b !== previousB) {\n            onUpdateB(a, b);\n        }\n    },\n    [a, b, onUpdateA, onUpdateB]\n);\n```\n---"}

React requires that components and hooks are [pure functions of props, state, and context](https://react.dev/reference/rules). React Compiler compiles code assuming that it upholds this fundamental rule of React. If a component is pure and it calls an imported helper w `helper(arg)`, then by definition the only thing that can change the value is if `arg` changes. This is why you see the memoization behavior you described. \n\nIn your example, `Comp` could already fail to update in a number of ways wo involving the compiler. For example, someone could wrap it in React.memo, wrap a `<Comp />` element in useMemo(), or wrap the `getSomeValue(arg)` call in useMemo(), all of which would cause the value to stop updating. To ensure components update as their inputs change in React, you have to use state, pass new root props, or some abstraction over those. \n\nNote that React Compiler makes a best effort to detect use of known impure functions, like Date.now or Math.random. But in general, it\u2019s up to developers to not use impure functions.\n---\n\nUser 'josephsavona' said:\n---\nI realized after writing this: your example uses a helper that you define, imported from another file.

The compiler assumes that if you\u2019re calling a function in render that it\u2019s pure - it\u2019s simply impractical to have users opt-in to telling us every single function that\u2019s pure or impure other than by using or not using them during render.\n---"}

So we can maybe simplify to where there's a `computeThing(data)` call and the result of that is returned: [example playground](https://playground.react.dev/#N4Igzg9grgTgxgUxALhASwLYAcIwC4AEASggIZyEBmMEGBA5DGRfQNwA6AdpjvgcAShgEARSgIYATwIBfAtVoMAAnlKcwquAGsA9E3J4AtAEdxUtly5wI6wtexQ8CACoALNJwDmBALwEAFACUvgB8-FwEBNbqEAA2CAB0sRCe-hGRDACE2QQAyq7QsQAmBJwQhEyGMFCcBDYElUycRRIANAQARo4ERRAIYAQA7mh4rg3MRvZYaPEwmfTpgRy143iwtQCypKMJYMb4-gCMAAwEAFQEAJznBAAcNwDsNwBsNwCsS1wyy1wIAB68Kg1ChoepCBAAMQQeDgrjcHlSwWA6WiGn4PW2pHaaDAABkIKQigj2hIaDBZL5BMIxBJJP5kStIqZaQBpBCSZAEADa9A6sVIrnoAF1WukmWZJBDOJzSGBJJw4AFgj4wgyMhlURV+lhKaRBqQRvJobD-PRPBAUvEEvZ6J9GRkmGsYLUmGAsMt1TJRSsZHaUTY0VNHAgSn4SAYEuCNggMBB-EFQuF7Y71lFaFhg-CvP4ipi7ZEvdzc6ohX6Vqi4olkqk-mXIinneig04iti8QSiV4STAybJljIQDIgA).\n\nAs you can see, the compiler is memoizing the `computeThing(data)` call, and will only run it when  `data` changes. Relevant bit from the output panel is:\n\n```js\n  let t1;\n  if ($[1] !== data) {\n    t1 = computeThing(data);\n    $[1] = data;\n    $[2] = t1;\n  } else {\n    t1 = $[2];\n  }\n  const computed = t1;\n```\n\nThis is the same behavior as `useMemo()`. If this is re-running, then by process of elimination it means that `data` must have actually changed (or the component itself got torn down and re-rendered, perhaps it rendered with a different `key`?). If `useFetch()` isn't returning stable results, that would be a bug with its implementation.\n---\n\nUser 'TkDodo' said:\n---\nThe problem in the reproduction is that the memoization wasn\u2019t using `data`, and that the custom hook wasn\u2019t doing anything with the `useMemo` result apart from logging it.\n\nHere\u2019s a version where:\n\n- `computeThing` actually uses data\n- `useFetchThing` returns the result that `useMemo` computes\n- the component actually renders the result from `useFetchThing`\n\nand with that, everything works as expected:\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-hvnbdwnm?file=src%2FuseFetchThing.tsx\n---\n\nUser 'TheSisb' said:\n---\nThank you for the explanation, this makes sense.\n---"}

I understand that it generally doesn't make sense to write a custom hook that doesn't use any other hooks, but the exception is when the custom hook would have used only `useMemo` and/or `useCallback`, such as `useBaz`.

We'd love to hear more details about your use case, could you share a bit about:\r\n- what app logic your hook contains, and why it needs to be a custom hook (instead of a non-hook function)\r\n- why memoization optimizations need to be applied to the hook\n---\n\nUser 'billyjanitsch' said:\n---\n@mofeiZ Sure! Building off of the general case that I mentioned:\r\n\r\n>I understand that it generally doesn't make sense to write a custom hook that doesn't use any other hooks, but the exception is when the custom hook would have used only useMemo and/or useCallback, such as useBaz. I expect the compiler to let me remove those hooks without losing memoization.\r\n\r\nHere are some simplified concrete examples of hooks that only use `useCallback` and/or `useMemo`:\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nfunction useMergedRefs(refA, refB) {\r\n  return useCallback((node) => {\r\n    // (simplified implementation only for ref callbacks)\r\n    refA(node)\r\n    refB(node)\r\n  }, [refA, refB])\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nfunction useProcessedData(data) {\r\n  return useMemo(() => someExpensiveTransform(data), [data])\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe crux of the issue is that I expect the React compiler to let me remove `useCallback` and `useMemo` from these hooks because it can memoize them automatically. But when I do so, the hooks lose memoization because the compiler no longer considers them hooks without those calls.\r\n\r\nDoes that clear up why these need to be hooks rather than non-hook functions, and why memoization optimizations are required?\r\n\r\n(As a workaround, I can leave the manual `useCallback` and `useMemo` calls in place. Is this the intended long-term solution?)\r\n\r\n>We know that this isn't a perfect heuristic\r\n\r\nI assume the current heuristic is designed to avoid false positives. Maybe the compiler could loosen the heuristic to compile all `^use[A-Z]` functions if the current filename has a `.jsx`/`.tsx` extension, on the assumption that if a file has explicitly opted into React syntax, it's unlikely to include non-React code that uses React naming conventions? Still imperfect ofc.\n---\n\nUser 'mofeiZ' said:\n---\nI see, you're moving code out of your component / custom hook body, and you'd like React Compiler to apply the same granular memoization to it.\r\n\r\nThe main issue with loosening the heuristic is that false positives currently error at runtime (producing an error like reported in #31802). There are two approaches you could take here:\r\n1. Rename your custom hook-named functions to non-hook names. This will let the compiler memoize your code at the function callsite (within the function body of a hook / component). It also lets you be more flexible with how your function gets called (e.g. it can be dynamically composed, used in a loop, etc).\r\n```js\r\nfunction processData(data) {\r\n  return someExpensiveTransform(data);\r\n}\r\n// caller of processData\r\nfunction MyComponent(props) {\r\n  // React Compiler will memoize this line\r\n  const data = processData(props.data)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. If you really need to ensure that these functions are memoized, you can annotate them with a `use memo` directive.\r\n```js\r\nfunction useProcessedData(data) {\r\n  'use memo';\r\n  return someExpensiveTransform(data);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA major semantic difference between these two approaches is that (2) means that your function is subject to the [rules of hooks and must be pure](https://react.dev/reference/rules#components-and-hooks-must-be-pure).\n---\n\nUser 'anukaal' said:\n---\nThe code for the createFastHash function currently uses MD5. To replace MD5 with SHA-256, we can modify the function to use the sha256 algorithm instead.

This kind of thing should have died with IE never to be tolerated again. It's been 3.5 years since this issue was opened - ample time to get React prepared for the day when browsers support this attribute (not to the mention error of a design that requires a framework to be maintained alongside the HTML spec). \r\n\r\nReact is a corporate project with a multi-million dollar budget and highly paid full-time maintainers. Again, really great people just like the old IE team, but it is unacceptable to drag your feet for over 3 years on web standards like this and other instances.

We plan to land it in stable in React 19.\n---\n\nUser 'Cuuki' said:\n---\nHi @eps1lon, we just got an update for the `@types/react` package for patch version [18.2.67](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/@types%2freact/18.2.65/18.2.67) from Renovate. We are using `inert` as type `'' | undefined` so we had some type failures after the update since the attribute now expects `boolean | undefined`. Unfortunately, React 18 doesn't add the attribute to the DOM node with `inert={true}`.\r\n\r\nAs you mentioned this was only meant for experimental and stable in React 19 so the patch version bump is incorrect or at least doesn't work as expected \ud83e\udd14 . This would rather be a breaking change that should only be included in `@types/react@>=19`. I am uncertain how the type packages are handled regarding SemVer and the actual react package version, this would just be my expectation as a consumer.\r\n\r\nWe have pinned the `@types/react` package to `18.2.66` in the meantime. I just found this issue and the recent activity and thought you might want to know! \ud83d\ude42\n---\n\nUser 'eps1lon' said:\n---\n@Cuuki Something in your app is pulling in types for the `experimental` release channel e.g. a `import react/experimental` or `/// <reference types=\"react/experimental\" />` somewhere in your app.\r\n\r\nThe stable types do not have types for `inert`. I'd need a full repro to see the issue. But we defintiely didn't add the types for `inert` in stable types\n---\n\nUser 'benface' said:\n---\nI confirm I have the same issue as @Cuuki and I am definitely not importing `react/experimental`.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Though maybe Next.js, which I use, is doing it?\n---\n\nUser 'eps1lon' said:\n---\nI think I did that in Next.js for convenience a while ago not realizing they vendor Canary not Experimental. I'll check how we can fix it. Might need to break users of experimental features.\r\n\r\nI recommend upgrading and annotating breakages with `@ts-expect-error`.\n---\n\nUser 'Cuuki' said:\n---\nWe are authoring a component library with multiple packages in a monorepo, other than `emotion` and `react-aria` we don't depend on much here. So at least in this context, Next.js is only used in one of the example apps, outside of the library scope where the error was thrown.\r\n\r\nI had already checked for experimental occurence usage earlier but it could of course be that some of the dependencies pull in the experimental types but I can't be sure. If I find some time in the upcoming days I can try to analyze this further, in the meantime I will go with the `@ts-expect-error` suggestion - thank you! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n---\n\nUser 'lgenzelis' said:\n---\nSame happening here (I'm also using NextJs, so there's definitely a pattern here). We have very strict rules agains using `@ts-expect-error`, so for now I disabled the updates for `@types/react`, no problem.  :)\n---\n\nUser 'thathurtabit' said:\n---\nShould this issue be reopened until React 19? \ud83e\udd37  [i.e. this comment](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/17157#issuecomment-2003750544)\n---\n\nUser 'h3rmanj' said:\n---\n@eps1lon \r\n> `boolean` values for `inert` landed in the Experimental release channel (`react-dom@experimental`). `inert=\"\"` will then be treated as `false` instead of `true` in experimental builds.

To handle this, you can store the value in a ref and pass it down through context.\n\nHowever, when a child component mutates this value (for example, inside an event handler), the compiler currently produces an error and causes optimizations to be skipped.

This is partially a practical constraint (in that it covers 99% of use cases) and partially an intentional trade off in that certain APIs (like Context or `useMutableSource`) are able to be more efficiently implemented because of it.\r\n\r\nFor example, rather than using a (slower) `Map` structure to maintain a (per-renderer) stack of context values, the Context API is able to store this stack on the context object using a designated field:\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/93a0c2830534cfbc4e6be3ecc9c9fc34dee3cfaa/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberNewContext.new.js#L78-L111\r\n\r\nSame for the `useMutableSource` API:\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/93a0c2830534cfbc4e6be3ecc9c9fc34dee3cfaa/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactMutableSource.new.js#L30-L62\r\n\r\n> Warning: Detected multiple renderers concurrently rendering the same context provider. This is currently unsupported.\r\n\r\nThis warning suggests that two renderers **of the same type** (presumably two primary renderers) are both using a context at the same time (concurrently). This *might happen to work okay* in some cases (e.g. if only the global/default context value is being used) but it **may also break** depending on how each renderer is using the context.\r\n\r\nHope this helps answer your question! tl;dr is that the warning is valid and important.\n---\n\nUser 'vimcaw' said:\n---\nThank you for such a detailed answer! now I understand.\r\n\r\nBoth of [react-pixi](https://github.com/inlet/react-pixi) and [react-babylonjs](https://github.com/brianzinn/react-babylonjs) have a custom renderer, plus the original `react-dom`, there are 3 renderers, seems I must give up one of them.\n---\n\nUser 'alirezamirian' said:\n---\n@bvaughn \n\n> This is partially a practical constraint (in that it covers 99% of use cases) and partially an intentional trade off in that certain APIs (like Context or useMutableSource) are able to be more efficiently implemented because of it.\n\nDoesn't this mean many cases of rendering multiple react roots in the same page (which seems to be [officially supported](https://react.dev/reference/react/useId#specifying-a-shared-prefix-for-all-generated-ids)) can lead to unexpected issues? \nWhat if there is a layer of abstraction for things like reading the current value of the context, which defaults to a simple  `._currentValue` property access but is can be changed to a different map-based implementation with a global option or something? It seems to not come with a big complexity overhead, as the change will be pretty isolated.\n---"}

{"instruction": "A user reported the following issue titled 'Bug: CSS not being applied properly in Chrome with React experimental (moveBefore)' in the 'facebook/react' repository. Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\nReact version: `0.0.0-experimental-3820740a-20250509`\n\nI ran into what appears to be a paint bug in Chrome, which is only triggered by React experimental (not React stable), and doesn\u2019t reproduce in either Firefox or Safari. Basically, after rerendering a list of elements with keys, the CSS is not being applied properly to the elements despite being correct in the dev tools.\n\nI reported it at https://issues.chromium.org/issues/417426569, but I\u2019m crossposting here as well in case someone can figure out how to reproduce it without React, or explain what is different between the latest stable version of React and React experimental.\n\n## Steps to reproduce the problem\n- Clone the repository at https://github.com/guillaumebrunerie/paint-bug\n- Run `npm install` and `npm run dev`, open Chrome at `localhost:5173`, and open the dev tools.\n- Note that the red rectangles are ordered from left to right when reading from top to bottom, this is correct.\n- Click the \"Refresh\" button in the webpage a few times (it simply recreates a fresh set of data to render, in the same way as the initial set of data is created).\n- Note that the red rectangle are no longer ordered from left to right, but checking the DOM in the dev tools, you can see that according to the `left: XX%` styles, they should be ordered.\n- You can also try to change very slightly the value of a `left: XX%` style (for instance going from `13%` to `13.00001%`), it completely changes the position of the corresponding element, which shows that the element wasn\u2019t painted at the correct position to begin with.\n\nSource code (React): https://github.com/guillaumebrunerie/paint-bug/blob/main/src/main.jsx\nCSS: https://github.com/guillaumebrunerie/paint-bug/blob/main/src/index.css\n\n## Problem Description\n\nThe example creates a list of 10 random numbers between 0 and 90, sorts it, and then for each of them renders an element with width 10% and left XX%. The list is rendered using React keys based on the original order, which means that clicking refresh will reuse the existing elements, reorder them, and change their CSS.\n\nI could only reproduce this issue with React experimental, but it seems clear to me that it is a Chrome issue, not a React issue, as the CSS is not being applied properly despite being correct in the DevTools. No idea what React experimental does differently than React stable, though.\n\nThe issue does not reproduce in either Firefox or Safari. Not sure if it is a regression, as I only recently switched to React experimental. I could reproduce it in Chrome Beta 137.0.7151.15 and in Chrome Canary 138.0.7177.0 as well.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84a9644b-87d9-43fb-81f8-3b399bc47fce)\n\nVideo: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/451c82c0-1939-4a66-9d3b-c5a499b90442", "response": "The issue was addressed with the following discussion:\n\nUser 'guillaumebrunerie' said:\n---\nI managed to reproduce it without React, it\u2019s `parentNode.moveBefore(node, null)` that doesn\u2019t seem to apply CSS changes properly, check the Chrome issue for more details.\n---\n\nUser 'zp1996' said:\n---\n[The issue of Chromium](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/417426569) has been fixed and the patch has been merged into Chromium\u2019s main branch.

Open [codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/confident-sky-8vr69k](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/confident-sky-8vr69k)\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  const formAction = async () => {\r\n    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 3000));\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <form action={formAction}>\r\n      <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" />\r\n      <input type=\"submit\" />\r\n    </form>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default App;\r\n```\r\n2. Input \"1\" in the text field\r\n3. Submit form\r\n4. Within 3 seconds (before the Client Action resolved), submit the form again\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\nForm fields resetted.\r\n\r\nActual behavior:\r\nThe page breaks reporting a TypeError below:\r\n```\r\nTypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'queue')\r\nrequestFormReset$1\r\nhttps://gwprwq.csb.app/node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom-client.development.js:7001:74\r\neval\r\nhttps://gwprwq.csb.app/node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom-client.development.js:6956:15\r\nstartTransition\r\nhttps://gwprwq.csb.app/node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom-client.development.js:6908:27\r\nstartHostTransition\r\nhttps://gwprwq.csb.app/node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom-client.development.js:6948:7\r\nlistener\r\nhttps://gwprwq.csb.app/node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom-client.development.js:16008:21\r\nprocessDispatchQueue\r\nhttps://gwprwq.csb.app/node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom-client.development.js:16066:17\r\neval\r\nhttps://gwprwq.csb.app/node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom-client.development.js:16665:9\r\nbatchedUpdates$1\r\nhttps://gwprwq.csb.app/node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom-client.development.js:2689:40\r\ndispatchEventForPluginEventSystem\r\nhttps://gwprwq.csb.app/node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom-client.development.js:16221:7\r\ndispatchEvent\r\nhttps://gwprwq.csb.app/node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom-client.development.js:20127:11\r\ndispatchDiscreteEvent\r\nhttps://gwprwq.csb.app/node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom-client.development.js:20095:11\r\n```\r\n\r\nAm I missing anything?

Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\nWhen moving a component with an iframe down within a group of components it reinitialises the iframe. The iframe only reinitialises when moving down, moving upward seems to work fine.\n\nExample: http://jsfiddle.net/pieterv/fnkLf/", "response": "The issue was addressed with the following discussion:\n\nUser 'vjeux' said:\n---\nI can't see anything wrong with your code from a 2 min inspection.

So it might not be reasonable to expect this to work. Consider two frames that need to trade places. One has to get removed from the DOM and reattached, no matter what you do. Hoping to get away with lucky re-renderings is a recipe for fragile code.\n---\n\nUser 'pieterv' said:\n---\n@benjamn yes that makes sense thinking about the DOM operations required to reorder the elements, it was just because of reacts preference to move things downward as @plievone pointed out that the up operation was working without reinitialising.\n---\n\nUser 'sophiebits' said:\n---\nYou might think that you could just call `insertBefore` or `appendChild` without ever removing the elements from the DOM but at least in Chrome, that still makes one of the iframes reload. Maybe that means we can't fix this.\n---\n\nUser 'syranide' said:\n---\nYeah, just did some manual tests as well, this actually appears to be _impossible_ to workaround in the DOM, and some internet searching suggests the same.\n\nThe only universal solution I see is to somehow be able to mark a component as `mustNotMove` which will apply all the way up to the root, which would prevent any move operation on those nodes and the siblings would be used for reordering instead. It would work for all cases except for when two `mustNotMove` components changes sides.\n\nHowever, I'm curious how much of an issue this actually is today? Does this make iframe in React virtually pointless because of conditionals further up in parents, or is it really only an issue when explicitly moving components with iframes around?\n---\n\nUser 'benjamn' said:\n---\nThis is one of the most regrettable misfeatures of `<iframe>`s, in my opinion. And, yes, it makes them pretty much useless in situations where DOM manipulations are abstracted out of your control, as they are in React.\n---\n\nUser 'plievone' said:\n---\nTo prevent reloading of `<iframe>`s, one can keep each of them in separate divs, somewhere safe from DOM manipulations, and move/scale them with absolute positioning in sync with some placeholder elements. :)\n---\n\nUser 'syranide' said:\n---\n@plievone Yeah, but the only way to keep them perfectly in sync would be to poll every frame, and this would cause lag on IE8 as it doesn't support `requestAnimationFrame`. Also, you'll have issues with `z-index`.\n---\n\nUser 'syranide' said:\n---\n@spicyj @benjamn I had a look at React and it is possible to solve this _as good as it gets_ (i.e. an iframe may never move to the other side of another iframe) by applying a `immovable`-flag up the hierarchy for iframes. When React wants to move such a component it should instead shuffle the siblings over to the other side of it instead of moving the node itself. This should have virtually zero cost when no `immovable` component is moved.\n\nBeen trying to wrap my head around `ReactMultiChild` and `DOMChildrenOperations` for a bit, it seems like it should be possible. But my head is apparently not up for the task right now. :)\n---\n\nUser 'pieterv' said:\n---\nJust for reference i got an implementation going as @plievone suggested by absolute positioning the iframe into place, http://jsfiddle.net/pieterv/fnkLf/6/, but as expected it seems to be pretty fragile code, you would really need to have the siblings as set height elements to get away with not polling their position on every frame.\n---\n\nUser 'syranide' said:\n---\n@pieter-vanderwerff FYI, I have a proof-of-concept for a React PR working right now, just fixing the last issues. With it, iframes will work as they should as long as two iframe containing components never switch sides. Meaning, it should basically solve most common use-cases, except for moving say comments with iframes up/down in a list, but static iframes and blog style pages will work perfectly.\n\nIt seems like it's a relatively light-weight fix too so hopefully they accept it.\n---\n\nUser 'pieterv' said:\n---\n@syranide awesome, i look forward to seeing it!\n---\n\nUser 'syranide' said:\n---\n@pieter-vanderwerff I dare you to check my updated PR, I found something _way way better_ than attributes to use! :D\n---\n\nUser 'pixelcort' said:\n---\nWould using CSS Flexbox's `box-ordinal-group` to rearrange iframes help? That way you don't need to remove either iframe from the DOM. Of course, this would only work on newer browsers, and would be something one would write themselves on top of React.\n---\n\nUser 'syranide' said:\n---\n@pixelcort Probably not, the issue is specifically when they (or any of their ancestores) are detached from the DOM, which always happens if you try to move them in any way it seems.\n---\n\nUser 'Prinzhorn' said:\n---\nI have a related issue with iframes which needs a different fix. I have a component using the Twitter API to embed a tweet in `componentDidMount`. This works great, until the component is rearranged by react (it's part of a list and has a key). When this happens, the iframe becomes completely empty. It can't just reload the src because the Twitter API does JavaScript magic directly with the iframe. I would need to clean up the iframe and load a new one using the API when this happens.\n\nSo the problem here is that the component has no way of knowing that this just happened. There is no lifecycle method telling it about the DOM manipulation (sth. like `componentDidRemount`?). Since the component also uses the PureRenderMixin literally nothing happens to it when it gets moved in the DOM. It doesn't seem possible for me to fix this outside of react.\n\nEdit: I found a workaround for my particular use-case to at least have a chance to reload the tweet. The iframe will fire an `onload` event after it has been reloaded (even though the twitter generated iframe doesn't have a `src`).\n---\n\nUser 'aduth' said:\n---\n>Would using CSS Flexbox's box-ordinal-group to rearrange iframes help?

When the app is run with the React Compiler enabled `fetch` is broken and all calls to the function fail with `TypeError: Cannot read property 'doRequest' of undefined`.\n\nI haven't followed compiler development very closely at all, so I didn't have enough context about what the compiler is doing to change the js runtime behavior to pull the thread much further than this.\n\nThe patching code in `react-native-supertokens` can be found here: https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-react-native/blob/master/lib/ts/fetch.ts#L63-L91\n\nThe issue isn't specific to Android, it just happened to be the emulator I had open while debugging.\n\n1. Run an Android emulator \n2. `npm install`\n3. `npm run android`\n4. The console should contain a dump of the response body from fetching `http://localhost:8081`\n5.

Note that React Compiler shouldn't be transforming the supertokens code itself since that's in node_modules (and we don't support classes anyway). And in general the compiler should work just fine with a patched global like this. My guess is that the code that is calling `fetch()` has some issue when run using the compiler. There's a lot of code in the repro, are you able to get a distilled example in the playground? I would focus on the code that is calling fetch().\n---\n\nUser 'vanstinator' said:\n---\nI pushed a simplified repro, but I've also spent some time narrowing down the specific place the error is thrown. It seems to be that when `AuthHttpRequest` is imported here https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-react-native/blob/master/lib/ts/recipeImplementation.ts#L3 it's value is `undefined` when the compiler is active. So the interceptor function a few lines down throws on `AuthHttpRequest.doRequest`, which is invoked when my example code calls `fetch`.\n\nLooking further, it seems like there's a circular dependency between https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-react-native/blob/master/lib/ts/fetch.ts#L30 and https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-react-native/blob/master/lib/ts/recipeImplementation.ts#L3\n\nI was able to confirm with a simple circular dependency in my reproduction repository that failed in the same manner when the react compiler was active.\n\nOn that note, I _think_ https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/32440 and https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/35100 are related to what I'm seeing.

But when on an actual app, for example using Material UI, the double click **isolates your components** and reduce noise.

It's been introduced by your commit d85cf3e5ab6e049626a8bedddffbaec05c516195.\n\nThe exact issue happens because you encapsulated all the redux `dispatch` calls in a transition action (in the function `dispatchWrapper`).\n\nIf I move the `dispatch` out of the `startTransition` action, the double click works again.\n\nI found this [SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58612514/8026386) explaining that Redux has its own state and that therefore it's not recommended to encapsulate dispatch calls in React transitions. I don't have enough knowledge on the question to know if it's true or why, but it could explain.\n\nI couldn't go deeper on why the transitions system is messing with redux. What I could do is putting logs in the `dispatchWrapper` function, and also in the reducer. The result is very surprising.\n\n\n<img width=\"782\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6dfc09d9-6fa9-4097-ab29-704e74dfbeaa\" />\n\n\nHere is a screenshot of my logs **without the transitions system**\n\n<img width=\"346\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d5c4218-8e79-4ce5-bef0-dfc0b092f60a\" />\n\n<img width=\"459\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d245afa-d26e-4c31-8591-cbc0d9f783d9\" />\n\n\nAnd here is a screenshot of the same logs **with the transitions system**\n\n<img width=\"346\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18e8e799-78b7-4721-a4d7-c755bebd92e8\" />\n\n<img width=\"386\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91551b12-a29b-429c-b603-5b9fca08c06c\" />\n\n\nIt goes like this for a while (but it's not an infinite loop, it stops at a moment. I'd say we have around 100 logs). I don't know why but it kind of looks like the action is called a lot of times.\n\n\nIs there any reason you made these changes to use the transitions system there? If the thing has no real value, I could make a PR to rollback and remove the `dispatchWrapper` function. \nYou tell me \ud83d\ude03\n---\n\nUser 'hoxyq' said:\n---\n@clementlize, this is a great find.\n\n> I found the issue. It's been introduced by your commit https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/d85cf3e5ab6e049626a8bedddffbaec05c516195.\n\nJust to make sure, have you validated that the double-click action is handled correctly on the parent commit? We've been using this pattern of wrapping `dispatcher` in a `startTransition` even before my changes. I've removed `startTransition` in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/31956/commits/717d3ee64d216df8d920c75ce4d9ffe98d99e943 and brought it back in https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/d85cf3e5ab6e049626a8bedddffbaec05c516195, but I've probably introduced some side-effects.\n\nKeyboard or click events should not be handled in `startTransition`, I think this is also the root cause of dropping keystrokes in Components panel search input.  \n\nI believe the reason for bringing the `startTransition` back was the fact that some Suspense boundaries were not resolved in time, more details in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/32298. \n\n> The exact issue happens because you encapsulated all the redux dispatch calls in a transition action (in the function dispatchWrapper).\n\nThe `dispatch` function is actually used from built-in [`useReducer`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer#dispatch) hook, so there is no need to dig into internals of `redux`.\n\nI think this whole approach of `dispatch` inside `startTransition` is incorrect. We should probably revert back to the approach before https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/31956/commits/717d3ee64d216df8d920c75ce4d9ffe98d99e943, where we would synchronously dispatch and then start a transition to update inspected view.\n---\n\nUser 'clementlize' said:\n---\n> Just to make sure, have you validated that the double-click action is handled correctly on the parent commit?\n\nYes I tested the parent commit and the double click works\n\n> I think this whole approach of dispatch inside startTransition is incorrect.

You can do whatever you want within the children of a leaf node of a React render tree.  React does not prohibit you from using mutative APIs, as long as you don't interfere with nodes that were rendered by React (that is to say, don't mutate a node that was rendered by React, because that would confuse React's reconciliation algorithm).  You can add/mutate children to a leaf node, but don't modify the children to a non-leaf.\n\nWe're trying to use github issues to track bugs in React, rather than questions.

I can imagine it\u2019s frustrating to have spent a lot of effort making your translations work via comments and to have the compiler break this. \r\n\r\nThe short answer is: we can't preserve comments in a way that works for all the schemes people have for them. This is because comments sort of _visually_ correspond to a part of the program, but this is not precise enough for tooling. If you've ever seen a comment get moved from something like prettier, this is why. \r\n\r\nTo make this concrete, consider a slightly tweaked snippet from your example:\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// translators: %s is username\r\nconst element = <div>{__s(\u201c...%s...\u201d)}</div>;\r\n```\r\n\r\nA human knows that this comment is really referring to the `__s(\"...\")` call expression. But JavaScript tooling just sees that this comment precedes the variable declaration statement. \r\n\r\nBecause comments have no semantic meaning in JavaScript -- they do not affect runtime behavior of the program -- it's perfectly fine for a tool to rewrite this code as follows:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst t0 = __s(\u201c...%s...\u201d);\r\n// translators: %s is username\r\nconst element = <div>{t0}</div>;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, it isn't enough to preserve comments. This particular comment scheme is meant to apply comment information to strings inside calls. So you might say, just move the comment up one line! But someone else might have a custom comment scheme that is meant to describe variable declarations, and then it would break if we moved the comment up! . There's literally no way for an arbitrary tool to know how to \"correctly\" preserve comments while rewriting code. \r\n\r\nThis is why JavaScript -- like effectively all modern languages -- makes comments semantically meaningless. This makes it safe to not preserve comments, or to make a best-effort. Many languages also typically carve out a safe space for semantic annotations. Rust has `#` syntax, JS has \"use strict\" style string directives as an unofficial pattern, etc. \r\n\r\nSo I hope this helps to put the existing behavior in context. We understand that it would be convenient if the compiler preserved comments, but it is impossible to do so in a general purpose way that everyone would be happy with. There isn't even a good-enough heuristic. As such, we do not and will not support preserving comments. \r\n\r\nIn contrast, type annotations provide semantic information in a structured form. We currently preserve some type annotations, and would consider supporting preserving them fully. \r\n\r\nWe would recommend exploring i18n approaches that do not depend on comments, and instead put the information about the meaning of the various interpolations (\"%s\") into the program itself. There are a number of popular libraries for this.\n---\n\nUser 'swissspidy' said:\n---\nThanks for the thorough response!\r\n\r\nI feared as much. While I agree that in a JS world comments are not the best way for such annotations, changing the i18n approach is unfortunately easier said than done. I'm sure you can understand that doing so in an ecosystem as big as WordPress is an enormous undertaking. The React-based Gutenberg editor is currently [exploring using React Compiler](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/66361), and this is a regression from an i18n perspective. While we can probably find a workaround there, thousands of extensions (plugins) will have to do the same.\r\n\r\nWould you be open to consider some middleground like preserving specific types of comments (e.g. `/*! preserve me */) or if they are within a function call itself (e.g. `__( /* translators: %s: username */ 'Hello %s'  )` or something?\n---\n\nUser 'tyxla' said:\n---\nI second @swissspidy here. Finding a workaround is not a challenge at all, but propagating it through hundreds of thousands of third-party projects (many of which don't even use React or will not adopt React 19 or the React Compiler) with as many third-party developers accumulating over the past ~20 years is doomed to failure. \r\n\r\nAn ideal solution would be to allow the Babel plugin to provide an environment configuration variable that enables skipping some comments. There's already a precedent for that with the `@enableMemoizationComments` flag:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/fe04dbcbc4185d7c9d7afebbe18589d2b681a88c/compiler/packages/babel-plugin-react-compiler/src/HIR/Environment.ts#L458C3-L458C28\r\n\r\nWould it be feasible to consider providing a similar flag that lets us declare an array of strings or regexes, and the React Compiler would skip stripping comments that have a match?\n---\n\nUser 'guillaumebrunerie' said:\n---\nHow are these special comments used? Is there a tool that automatically extracts them into some more usable format for translators? If so, can\u2019t this tool be run before the React compiler instead? Surely there are a bunch of other build steps (like minifiers and bundlers) that already remove comments.\n---\n\nUser 'josephsavona' said:\n---\n> An ideal solution would be to allow the Babel plugin to provide an environment configuration variable that enables skipping some comments. There's already a precedent for that with the @enableMemoizationComments flag\r\n\r\nJust a quick note that this flag isn\u2019t skipping comments, it tells the compiler to _synthesize_ comments describing what it\u2019s memorizing. You can see this for yourself by adding `// @enableMemoizationComments` as the first line in the playground. \r\n\r\nThe compiler transforms the Babel AST into our own internal representation (called HIR), runs an extensive number of passes, and then completely rebuilds the AST. Per my comment above, it is impossible for us to preserve comments in this process in a way that would work with every scheme you could come up with for comments. That is why the spec specifically makes comments semantically meaningless: otherwise it\u2019s just crazy town with everyone inventing different incompatible comment schemes and tooling literally can\u2019t touch your code. \r\n\r\n> If so, can\u2019t this tool be run before the React compiler instead? \r\n\r\nYes! This is what I would explore.\n---\n\nUser 'swissspidy' said:\n---\nApologies for the late response.\r\n\r\n> How are these special comments used? Is there a tool that automatically extracts them into some more usable format for translators?\r\n\r\nYes, exactly, it's a string extraction tool that then transfers the found strings to a translation platform or in a gettext POT file.\r\n\r\n> If so, can\u2019t this tool be run before the React compiler instead? Surely there are a bunch of other build steps (like minifiers and bundlers) that already remove comments.\r\n\r\nWe have set up our existing tooling (babel, webpack) so that translator comments are preserved. That works quite well so far.\r\n\r\nIn theory extracting the string from the source files (or finding any other solution) would be better for sure, but this is not feasible for the WordPress ecosystem, as pointed out by @tyxla. For WordPress core itself yes, there might be alternative approaches we could take in the short to medium term, as we are in full control there. But for the hundreds of thousands of plugins out there that's nearly impossible. And having two separate implementations just causes fragmentation.\n---\n\nUser 'nathanmarks' said:\n---\n@josephsavona Is this why I'm running into some weird issues where sometimes istanbul is not instrumenting the code properly? I'm seeing statements, functions, etc just not even getting recognized full stop.\r\n\r\nI spent a few hours diving into it. I first noticed that the statement/function/branch info instanbul injects into the file is completely missing things, (along with source location not being correct for some that did make it).\r\n\r\nIt looks like when the babel instanbul plugin runs, node visitors are simply not getting triggered for some things.\r\n\r\nFor example, given this super simple example:\r\n```ts\r\nexport default function useSomething() {\r\n  const isMobile = useIsMobile()\r\n\r\n  return isMobile\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`istanbul` is expecting these visitors ([1](https://github.com/istanbuljs-archived-repos/istanbul-lib-instrument/blob/master/src/visitor.js#L424), [2](https://github.com/istanbuljs-archived-repos/istanbul-lib-instrument/blob/master/src/visitor.js#L420)) to get invoked, and they never do when the react compiler babel plugin runs first. I also noticed that the AST is missing stuff like source location info for nodes etc.\r\n\r\nOut of the box, `jest` appends istanbul to the rest of the babel plugins.\n---\n\nUser 'josephsavona' said:\n---\n@swissspidy thanks for the extra context.\r\n\r\n> But for the hundreds of thousands of plugins out there that's nearly impossible. And having two separate implementations just causes fragmentation.\r\n\r\nI think this gets at the crux of the issue. Wordpress ended up with a translation approach that uses comments in a way that is incompatible with the JavaScript specification. The main two options are for Wordpress to do the work to migrate to an approach that is compatible with the JS standard (at which point lots of other tooling considerations probably get easier too), or React Compiler could attempt to support Wordpress' bespoke system. Given the complexity and challenges of supporting this, that i've described above, we are unable to take on implementing this and also unable to commit to supporting a community contribution.  \r\n\r\nWe understand this may be challenging, but we really would recommend evaluating what it would take to move to an approach that uses code rather than comments to encode critical information. We have some experience with designing translations (Meta developed [fbt](https://facebook.github.io/fbt/) for example) and would be happy to discuss and provide guidance.\n---\n\nUser 'josephsavona' said:\n---\n> Is this why I'm running into some weird issues where sometimes istanbul is not instrumenting the code properly? I'm seeing statements, functions, etc just not even getting recognized full stop.\r\n\r\n@nathanmarks Likely yes. We go to considerable effort to preserve source locations throughout our compilation process to facilitate debugging etc. However, we know that there are some gaps. The playground actually has a tab to visualize the source maps, and we are definitely open to PRs to improve the precision of our source locations to make source maps more accurate.\n---\n\nUser 'nathanmarks' said:\n---\n@josephsavona I was surprised by this minimal case because the compiler isn't even adding anything.\r\n\r\nWhat's the reason for the node visitors not even getting triggered in the istanbul code I linked above? is this because of information missing from the AST after the compiler runs? I didn't go much deeper but at a glance comparing outputs I did notice that the AST console.log output was missing some things that you normally see like the class names next to the objects etc.\n---\n\nUser 'josephsavona' said:\n---\n@nathanmarks I don't know exactly how Istanbul works, but my guess is that it is using source location information. If we're missing some source span information, that could be throwing off Istanbul's evaluation of which code got executed or not.\n---\n\nUser 'nathanmarks' said:\n---\n> @nathanmarks I don't know exactly how Istanbul works, but my guess is that it is using source location information. If we're missing some source span information, that could be throwing off Istanbul's evaluation of which code got executed or not.\r\n\r\nYou're bang on -- that's exactly the issue, they're ignoring node visits if location information is missing: https://github.com/istanbuljs-archived-repos/istanbul-lib-instrument/blob/master/src/visitor.js#L37\r\n\r\nAnd we're missing the `path.node.loc` off these.\r\n\r\nWhat's the correct approach here... running istanbul before, or fixing the source location issues and running after the compiler? Or not running compiler at all on specs (slightly reluctant on this one, as we've caught issues in specs due to unwanted memoization, and want to test the code as close to how it behaves in prod as possible)?\n---\n\nUser 'josephsavona' said:\n---\nThe fix for Istanbul is to add missing source locations. We\u2019re open to PRs that either add them or add fixtures demonstrating code where locations are missing. \r\n\r\nWhat I would do for the latter is add a feature flag on Environment that enables a source locations validator. This would run after codegen and errors for any nodes that are missing a location. Then you could write fixtures which enable this flag and will fail (expected w an \u201cerror.\u201d prefix) bc locations are missing.\n---\n\nUser 'nathanmarks' said:\n---\nThanks for the pointers! Let me have a look and see what I can do.\r\n\r\nIn parallel: correctness aside, as a temporary workaround on our app do you see any major issues with running istanbul first (otherwise we'll likely have to walk back our compiler rollout, as we're seeing devs get blocked on CI due to test suites suddenly reporting wonky coverage after unassuming changes). Everything seems to be fine on my side WRT the test suite behaving as expected.\n---\n\nUser 'github-actions[bot]' said:\n---\nThis issue has been automatically marked as stale. **If this issue is still affecting you, please leave any comment** (for example, \"bump\"), and we'll keep it open.

This isn't a bug as much as React Compiler not having access to function parameter types + effects. Right now, there's no way for us to understand that `filterData` does not write to its arguments. Replacing your filterData call with something that writes to its arguments, we see that it's invalid to memoize `mappedData` and `filteredData` separately.\n\n```js\nfunction appendIds(data, makeId) {\n  for (const entry of data) {\n    entry.id += makeId(entry);\n  }\n  return data;\n}\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  const { makeId } = useMakeId()\n  const { data } = useData()\n\n  const mappedData = data ? data.map(item => item) : []\n  const resultData = appendIds(mappedData, makeId)\n\n  return <RenderData data={resultData} />\n}\n```\nIf React Compiler produced the memoization you requested, the compiled output might look something like this.\n```\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  const { makeId } = useMakeId()\n  const { data } = useData()\n\n  let mappedData;\n  if (/* data changed */\n    mappedData = data ? data.map(item => item) : []\n  } else { /* reuse */ }\n  \n  let resultData;\n  if (/* mappedData or makeId changed */) {\n    resultData = appendIds(mappedData, makeId)\n  } else { /* reuse */ }\n  ...\n}\n```\nNow let's walk through what happens when we re-render with a changed `makeId` but the same `data`.\n1. We enter the else block of the first memo block, reusing the previous calculated `mappedData`. This already has IDs appended (from the previous render)\n2. We enter the if block of the second memo block, appending IDs (*again*) to mappedData. This is invalid.\n\n---\nDifferentiating between functions that change their arguments and ones that only read is difficult because neither typescript nor flow has deep read-only / mutable types. If you're a library author or working with widely reused functions, feel free to play around with the experimental / unstable `moduleTypeProvider` option, which should let you specify function effects\n---\n\nUser 'oleksii-kononykhin' said:\n---\n@mofeiZ Thank you for taking you time to answer! Your explanation makes perfect sense and thanks for a hint at `moduleTypeProvider`.

The reason DevTools throws is that the `Progress` Fiber's _owner_ (the `_debugOwner` attribute) points to a `Body` Fiber that hasn't been mounted yet. That seems unexpected.\r\n\r\nThis repro is just a wrapper around two NPM packages. Where's the source code for these packages? :D\r\n\r\n**Edit** I found it, although there's _a lot of indirection here_. Tracing one package which imports another which imports another. Would be helpful if it were flattened \ud83d\ude01  but I guess I can always step through the bundled source.\n---\n\nUser 'HillLiu' said:\n---\n> This repro is just a wrapper around two NPM packages.

Is the version of the source you linked me to the same as the one the Sandbox points to in NPM, @HillLiu?\r\n\r\n**Edit** Looks like the repro is using 0.18.8 (released a couple of months ago) but the latest NPM release is 0.11.1. That being said, it doesn't look like the files that are being imported have changed (at least not in source) so I'm still not sure what's up.\n---\n\nUser 'HillLiu' said:\n---\n@bvaughn I change two main components to hook style then get better performance, it reduce the error happen, but I still could get error.

That's what I was trying to do with moving the source but then the bug goes away b'c the code seems to be different.\r\n\r\nI noticed one potential difference being the `\"reshow-runtime/helpers/interopRequireDefault\"` indirection but I'm not sure how likely that is to be related.\n---\n\nUser 'bvaughn' said:\n---\nLooking at the error while debugging, it looks like the [render method of `Body` creates a `Progress` element during render and assigns it to `this._bar`](https://github.com/react-atomic/react-atomic-organism/blob/5e54e71eb191c76cd6447a394427832cfa51ae81/packages/organism-react-progress/ui/organisms/PageLoadProgressHandler.jsx#L132-L145), then either renders it _or_ dispatches a popup event to show it.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why (too sleepy to think it through maybe) but sometimes `Progress` seems to be mounting _before_ `Body` has, which goes against an assumption in DevTools. Will dig back in tomorrow.\n---\n\nUser 'bvaughn' said:\n---\n@HillLiu I really appreciate the repro case, but there are *so many layers of indirection* between the various NPM packages being used to dynamically create the components. It's difficult to trace through.\r\n\r\nI'm going to hand this issue to you and ask for a smaller repro case. (Without 10+ NPM projects that each require each other.) Is this something you can help with?\r\n\r\n**Edit** I _fixed_ this (#21562) but the test case I added is not great since it relies on unsupported side effects to trigger the problem case. I'd still love to get a smaller repro so I can (1) be sure I fully fixed the problem and (2) add a regression case so it doesn't get re-introduced.\n---\n\nUser 'bvaughn' said:\n---\nBugfix released as [version 4.13.5](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react-devtools/CHANGELOG.md#4135-may-25-2021)\n---\n\nUser 'mamedium' said:\n---\nthank you @bvaughn fixed on version 4.13.5 \ud83d\udc4d\n---\n\nUser 'HillLiu' said:\n---\n@bvaughn Thanks your effort.\r\n\r\nYour fixed also be success from my side.\n---\n\nUser 'minaairsupport' said:\n---\nif you are using store like redux or redux toolkit make sure you activate \ndev tools that way \n```\nconst composeWithDevTools =\n  window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ || compose\n```\nor\n`devTools: true,`\n---"}

Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\n### What happened?\n\nThe comments for `NewExponentialBackoffManager` read:\r\n```go\r\n// NewExponentialBackoffManager returns a manager for managing exponential backoff. Each backoff is jittered and\r\n// backoff will not exceed the given max. If the backoff is not called within resetDuration, the backoff is reset.\r\n// This backoff manager is used to reduce load during upstream unhealthiness.\r\n//\r\n// Deprecated: Will be removed when the legacy Poll methods are removed. Callers should construct a\r\n// Backoff struct, use DelayWithReset() to get a DelayFunc that periodically resets itself, and then\r\n// invoke Timer() when calling wait.BackoffUntil.\r\n//\r\n// Instead of:\r\n//\r\n//\tbm := wait.NewExponentialBackoffManager(init, max, reset, factor, jitter, clock)\r\n//\t...\r\n//\twait.BackoffUntil(..., bm.Backoff, ...)\r\n//\r\n// Use:\r\n//\r\n//\tdelayFn := wait.Backoff{\r\n//\t  Duration: init,\r\n//\t  Cap:      max,\r\n//\t  Steps:    int(math.Ceil(float64(max) / float64(init))), // now a required argument\r\n//\t  Factor:   factor,\r\n//\t  Jitter:   jitter,\r\n//\t}.DelayWithReset(reset, clock)\r\n//\twait.BackoffUntil(..., delayFn.Timer(), ...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn particular, the comments are asking us to use `wait.BackoffUntil(..., delayFn.Timer(), ...)`.\r\n\r\nThis does not seem possible, given that the second parameter for `wait.BackoffUntil` is of type `BackoffManager` (interface), while `delayFn.Timer()` returns a `Timer` interface. Maybe the author intended to update the definition of `BackoffUntil` but ended up not doing so for backwards-compatible reasons.\r\n\r\nEven `wait.BackoffUntil(..., bm.Backoff, ...)` does not seem correct.\r\n\r\nThe documentation for this package needs to be revisited.

{"instruction": "A user reported the following issue titled 'StatefulSet - can't rollback from a broken state' in the 'kubernetes/kubernetes' repository. Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\n/kind bug\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\n\r\nI updated a StatefulSet with a non-existent Docker image. As expected, a pod of the statefulset is destroyed and can't be recreated (ErrImagePull). However, when I change back the StatefulSet with an existing image, the StatefulSet doesn't try to remove the broken pod to replace it by a good one. It keeps trying to pull the non-existing image.\r\nYou have to delete the broken pod manually to unblock the situation.\r\n\r\n[Related Stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48894414/kubernetes-statefulset-pod-startup-error-recovery)\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\nWhen rolling back the bad config, I expected the StatefulSet to remove the broken pod and replace it by a good one.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\n1.

Once the 3 pods are running, update the StatefulSet spec and change the image to `k8s.gcr.io/nginx-slim:foobar`\r\n3. Observe the new pod failing to pull the image.\r\n4. Roll back the change.\r\n5.

This is a pretty big landmine in using StatefulSet, if you ever make any mistake you're stuck with just destroying your StatefulSet and starting over. IOW, if you ever make a mistake with StatefulSet, you need to cause an outage to recover :(\n---\n\nUser 'krmayankk' said:\n---\n/remove-lifecycle rotten\n---\n\nUser 'enisoc' said:\n---\nI apologize for letting this bug slip through the cracks, and for implying in [my earlier comment](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67250#issuecomment-414754525) that the current behavior is expected and acceptable. My intention was to report that I can confirm the bug exists and that it appears to be a design flaw rather than a regression.\r\n\r\nAs @MrTrustor noted in the original post, the workaround for this particular incarnation of the problem is to revert to a good Pod template, and then delete the stuck Pod. As a first step, I'll send a PR to the [StatefulSet docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/) to warn about this pitfall and describe the workaround.\r\n\r\nThe larger, unsolved problem is what to do when StatefulSet encounters a situation in which it can't be confident that any action it takes is likely to make things better instead of worse. StatefulSet was designed to provide automation for a \"most-sensitive common denominator\" of stateful apps, so it very often chooses to stop and do nothing if anything isn't going perfectly according to plan.\r\n\r\nA [thread on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dave_universetf/status/1104973833088520193) discussing this bug resulted in a suggestion by @danderson for a feature to help mitigate these situations: provide an \"escape hatch\" to tell StatefulSet to proceed anyway, even if it detects something wrong. I think that's a good starting point for making progress on the general problem. Perhaps it could take the form of a field in the [RollingUpdate strategy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#update-strategies) that applies all the time whenever it's set, or alternatively a one-time \"acknowledge and proceed\" signal that would tell StatefulSet to attempt to force-fix just one Pod but then revert to normal behavior after that.\r\n\r\nFor this specific incarnation of the general problem (a Pod that has never made it to Running state), we might be able to do something more automatic. Perhaps we can argue that it should always be safe to delete and replace such a Pod, as long as none of the containers (even init containers) ever ran. We'd also need to agree on whether this automatic fix-up can be enabled by default without being considered a breaking change, or whether it needs to be gated by a new field in StatefulSet that's off by default (until `apps/v2`).\r\n\r\nI'll start investigating some of these options and report back any findings. If anyone else has ideas or input, please leave them here.\n---\n\nUser 'andpol' said:\n---\nTo add a bit more information to this discussion, it's worth noting that the issue described in the original post is not present if you specify `podManagementPolicy: Parallel` in the StatefulSet spec. From what I can tell, this is because the value of `monotonic` is true in the code quoted [above](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67250#issuecomment-414754525). I guess this is somewhat implied by the policy name (rather calling it `ParallelReady` or something), and the StatefulSet docs do hint at this, but it was still a surprise to me when performing a rolling update.\n---\n\nUser 'enisoc' said:\n---\n@andpol Thanks, that's a good point. I made sure to mention it in my PR documenting this known issue: https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/13190\n---\n\nUser 'janetkuo' said:\n---\nThis works as intended and is documented here:\r\n\r\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateful-application/basic-stateful-set/#updating-statefulsets\r\n> The StatefulSet controller terminates each Pod, and **waits for it to transition to Running and Ready prior to updating the next Pod.** Note that, even though the StatefulSet controller will not proceed to update the next Pod until its ordinal successor is Running and Ready, it will restore any Pod that fails during the update to its current version. Pods that have already received the update will be restored to the updated version, and Pods that have not yet received the update will be restored to the previous version. In this way, the controller attempts to continue to keep the application healthy and the update consistent in the presence of intermittent failures.\r\n\r\nWhen designing StatefulSet (with OrderedReady policy) we expect any StatefulSet pods failure would require user intervention. But as discussed above we should provide users an escape hatch.\n---\n\nUser 'danderson' said:\n---\nI think we're talking about different things. The case I hit seemed to be a straightforward logic bug: if you create a StatefulSet with a broken template (in my case, resource requests such that all pods remain pending for ever), the sts controller will ignore any changes to the StatefulSet from there on. I applied a corrected template that could definitely schedule, deleted all pods... And the StatefulSet recreated them using the broken template, where they went pending again. I had to delete the entire StatefulSet and recreate it to get my template changes to apply.\r\n\r\nThat's what I meant when I spoke of overrides to @enisoc . While it's accepted that manual intervention will be needed sometimes (either by a human or a software operator), what I encountered was a situation where the StatefulSet ignored my interventions, and kept deploying broken pods. That was my complaint, not \"StatefulSet cannot guess what is safe or not for my arbitrary stateful workload\", that part definitely makes sense.\n---\n\nUser 'enisoc' said:\n---\n@danderson Ah that's different. Can you give some more details to help me understand and reproduce the form of the bug you hit?\r\n\r\nI tried the following steps with k8s v1.12.1:\r\n\r\n1. I created a StatefulSet apps/v1 with a memory request of `100Gi`.\r\n2. StatefulSet created pod-0 which was stuck Pending due to resource request.\r\n3. I edited the StatefulSet to remove the memory request from the Pod template.\r\n4. StatefulSet did nothing. This is the form of the bug we've discussed above.\r\n5. I deleted pod-0. StatefulSet recreated pod-0 without the memory request (using updated template), and then proceeded to create the rest of the Pods. This is the workaround discussed above.\r\n\r\nSince you said in your case \"all pods\" (implying more than one) were created but Pending, I suspected you may be using `podManagementPolicy: Parallel` so I tried the above steps with that setting:\r\n\r\n1. I created a StatefulSet apps/v1 with a memory request of `100Gi` and `podManagementPolicy: Parallel`.\r\n2. StatefulSet created pod-0, pod-1, pod-2 but all were stuck Pending due to resource requests.\r\n3. I edited the StatefulSet to remove the memory request from the Pod template.\r\n4. StatefulSet deleted the Pending pod-2 and recreated it with the new Pod template, which became Running and Ready. Then it did the same for pod-1, followed by pod-0. This is consistent with the [comment above](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67250#issuecomment-472988799) that this bug should not manifest when the podManagementPolicy is Parallel.\r\n\r\nDo you get different results? Or are there steps that I did differently?\n---\n\nUser 'antonlisovenko' said:\n---\nThis is a real blocker for programmatic usage of Statefulsets (from the Operator for example). The real use case: the operator creates the statefulset with some memory/cpu limits which cannot be fulfilled. So 2 pods are running and the 3rd is staying Pending as it cannot be scheduled to the node as there no available resources. Trying to fix and change the specification to have smaller limits doesn't help - the statefulset specification is updated but all the pods stay unchanged forever as the 3rd pod is Pending. The only way is to delete the pod manually which contradicts the nature of operators totally\n---\n\nUser 'enisoc' said:\n---\nAfter some initial investigation, I believe the mitigation described above should be feasible:\r\n\r\n> For this specific incarnation of the general problem (a Pod that has never made it to Running state), we might be able to do something more automatic. Perhaps we can argue that it should always be safe to delete and replace such a Pod, as long as none of the containers (even init containers) ever ran. We'd also need to agree on whether this automatic fix-up can be enabled by default without being considered a breaking change, or whether it needs to be gated by a new field in StatefulSet that's off by default (until apps/v2).\r\n\r\nThe specific incarnation we're talking about is when all of the following are true:\r\n\r\n1. There's a Pod stuck Pending because it was created from a bad StatefulSet revision.\r\n2. Deleting that stuck Pod (i.e. the workaround discussed above) would result in the Pod being replaced at a different revision (meaning we have reason to expect a different result; we won't hot-loop).\r\n\r\nIn this situation, I think we can argue that it's safe for StatefulSet to delete the Pending Pod for you, as long as we can ensure the Pod has not started running before we get around to deleting it. The argument would be, if the Pod never ran, then the application should not be affected one way or another if we delete it. We could potentially use the new [ResourceVersion precondition on Delete](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/74040) to give a high confidence level that the Pod never started running.\r\n\r\nThere is still a very slight chance that a container started running and had some effect on the application already but the kubelet has not updated the Pod status yet. However, I would argue that the chance of that is small enough that we should take the risk in order to prevent StatefulSet from getting stuck in this common situation.\r\n\r\nI probably won't have time to work on the code for this any time soon since I'm about to change jobs. However, I'm willing to commit to being a reviewer if anyone is available to work on this.\n---\n\nUser 'TopherGopher' said:\n---\n@enisoc I'm going to try taking a whack at this\n---\n\nUser 'draveness' said:\n---\nThis issue is similar to #78007\n---\n\nUser 'dims' said:\n---\n/sig architecture\n---\n\nUser 'fejta-bot' said:\n---\nIssues go stale after 90d of inactivity.\nMark the issue as fresh with `/remove-lifecycle stale`.\nStale issues rot after an additional 30d of inactivity and eventually close.\n\nIf this issue is safe to close now please do so with `/close`.\n\nSend feedback to sig-testing, kubernetes/test-infra and/or [fejta](https://github.com/fejta).\n/lifecycle stale\n---\n\nUser 'zerkms' said:\n---\n/remove-lifecycle stale\n---\n\nUser 'dims' said:\n---\n@alejandrox1 @krmayankk Do you want to deal with this in the tech debt work group?

We recently upgraded from Istio 1.4.4 to 1.5.4 and started seeing the issues described by OP.  Lots of liveness / readiness issues there were not happening before.  It SEEMS like adding let's say a 20sec initial delay had helped in most cases.  At this point we are still seeing it and not sure what the root cause is. \r\n\r\nrunning on EKS 1.15 (control plane) / 1.14 managed nodeGroups\n---\n\nUser 'athenabot' said:\n---\n@thockin\nIf this issue has been triaged, please comment `/remove-triage unresolved`.\n\nIf you aren't able to handle this issue, consider unassigning yourself and/or adding the `help-wanted` label.\n\n\ud83e\udd16 I am a bot run by vllry. \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udd2c\n---\n\nUser 'thockin' said:\n---\nI'm afraid the only way to know more is to get something like a tcpdump from both inside and outside the pod, which captures one or more failing requests.\r\n\r\nPossible?\n---\n\nUser 'den-is' said:\n---\nI'm getting same issue.\r\nCouple Nginx+PHP Pods running on huge instances in parallel with couple other small applications. \r\nThese are staging apps+nodes without constant traffic.\r\nI constantly receive notification that these Nginx+PHP app has restarted... specifically Nginx container of these Pods.\r\nAt the same time other apps running in the same namespace, nodes never restart.\r\n```\r\nk -n staging get events\r\n...\r\n22m         Warning   Unhealthy                  pod/myapp-staging3-59f75b5d49-5tscw    Liveness probe failed: Get http://100.100.161.197:80/list/en/health/ping: net/http: request canceled (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)\r\n23m         Warning   Unhealthy                  pod/myapp-staging4-7589945cc6-2nf4s    Liveness probe failed: Get http://100.100.161.198:80/list/en/health/ping: net/http: request canceled (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)\r\n11m         Warning   Unhealthy                  pod/myapp-staging5-84fb4494db-5dvph    Liveness probe failed: Get http://100.104.124.220:80/list/en/health/ping: net/http: request canceled (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nLiveness on an Nginx container looks like this:\r\n```yaml\r\n  liveness:\r\n    initialDelaySeconds: 10\r\n    periodSeconds: 10\r\n    failureThreshold: 3\r\n    httpGet:\r\n      path: /list/en/health/ping\r\n      port: 80\r\n```\r\nUPD: Strange thing is that completely distinct deployments you can see above staging4 staging5 stagingN - above 10 deployments fail at once.\r\n\r\nMy possible problem might be in missing `timeoutSeconds` which is default `1s`\n---\n\nUser 'rudolfdobias' said:\n---\nHaving the same problem here. \r\n```yaml\r\nlivenessProbe:\r\n        httpGet:\r\n          path: /status\r\n          port: 80\r\n        initialDelaySeconds: 30\r\n        periodSeconds: 10\r\n        timeoutSeconds: 10\r\n        failureThreshold: 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nError cca 3 - 10 times a day:\r\n> Liveness probe failed: Get http://10.244.0.154:8002/status: net/http: request canceled (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)\r\n\r\nThe service operates normally and responds to /status in 5ms, though.\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f  Also, and that is a bigger problem, at similar random times some pods refuse to connect to each other. \r\n\r\nRunning on Azure Kubernetes Service\r\nV 1.14.8\n---\n\nUser 'arjun921' said:\n---\nI'm facing the same issue as well, increasing timeoutSeconds didn't help.\r\n```yaml\r\n          livenessProbe:\r\n            httpGet:\r\n              path: /ping\r\n              port: http\r\n            failureThreshold: 5\r\n            initialDelaySeconds: 5\r\n            periodSeconds: 20\r\n            timeoutSeconds: 10\r\n          readinessProbe:\r\n            httpGet:\r\n              path: /ping\r\n              port: http\r\n            initialDelaySeconds: 5\r\n            periodSeconds: 20\r\n            timeoutSeconds: 10\r\n```\r\nRuning on Kubernetes v1.16.7 on AWS deployed via KOPS\n---\n\nUser 'thockin' said:\n---\nI appreciate the extra reports.

Nothing else.\r\nStill investigating.\r\n\r\nWhile ~5 other PHP apps deploys on the same staging nodes never restart.\n---\n\nUser 'Siddharthk' said:\n---\nI am also facing the same issue. Running on Kubernetes v1.16.8 on AWS EKS. Any workarounds?\n---\n\nUser 'zaabskr' said:\n---\nI am also facing the same issue with AKS 1.16.9. This is occuring consistently. Is there any way to investigate the issue?\n---\n\nUser 'AndriiNeverov' said:\n---\n@zaabskr \r\n\r\nLooks like this error message is a symptom of a more general problem of node-to-pod connectivity issues.\r\n\r\nIn our case, we confirmed that by using `traceroute` from the node to the pod's internal IP as suggested in https://discuss.kubernetes.io/t/who-where-actually-work-liveness-probe-in-kubernetes/4771/6. That IP was perfectly routable from the other pods and even from many other nodes, but not from that particular node it ended up on. The root cause turned out to be that the br-int (bridge) interface that connects the pod networks and the NSX overlay logical switch was failing to come up because of missing static routes. Fixing that magically solved the problem.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, the root cause may be different, but the first step would be to confirm whether the node can actually access that pod, e.g. ssh and traceroute or curl into the readiness probe (`curl -v http://172.70.3.3:15020/healthz/ready` when Istio sidecar containers fail to get ready), etc.\n---\n\nUser 'chasebolt' said:\n---\nexperiencing this issue in multiple GKE clusters. just started about 5 days ago. right now i'm having to drain the bad node and remove it from the pool. running `1.16.9-gke.6`\n---\n\nUser 'colotiline' said:\n---\nMy issue was in a REST API dependency that was checked by readinessProbe. Doubles readinessTimeout helped.\n---\n\nUser '23ewrdtf' said:\n---\n**What happened**: After updating EKS from v1.14.9-eks-f459c0 to v1.15.11-eks-065dce some of our ReplicaSets and DaemonSets Liveness/Readiness probes started failing with `Liveness probe failed: Get http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:80/: net/http: request canceled (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers` \r\n\r\nIt seems that random pods are affected. I can successfully curl to them from other pods.\r\n\r\nAll nodes and pods are fine, not CPU/Memory/Storage issues.\r\n\r\nTwo nodes are running 1.15 and the rest 1.14. There doesn't seem to be a correlation between node version and the issue.\r\n\r\nNothing obvious in `kubectl cluster-info dump` or `journalctl -r` or `kube-proxy.log`\r\n\r\nProbes are mostly configured like this (truncated):\r\n```\r\n    livenessProbe:\r\n      failureThreshold: 3\r\n      periodSeconds: 10\r\n      successThreshold: 1\r\n      timeoutSeconds: 1\r\n\r\n    readinessProbe:\r\n      failureThreshold: 3\r\n      periodSeconds: 10\r\n      successThreshold: 1\r\n      timeoutSeconds: 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nI will increase the timeouts but it would be good to solve this.

Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\n### What happened?\n\nWhen the host system's `/dev` is mounted into a container, `volumeDevices` do not appear to get created. \n\nEven if `/dev` is mounted into a container, it is necessary to be able to map a volume (e.g. a PVC with `volumeMode: Block`) to a known name, because the actual path of the block device in `/dev` may vary.\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nI expect `volumeDevices` to be mapped no matter what other volumes are mounted into the container.\n\n### How can we reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?\n\nCreate a Block PVC:\n\n```\napiVersion: v1\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\nmetadata:\n  name: test\nspec:\n  accessModes:\n  - ReadWriteOnce\n  resources:\n    requests:\n      storage: 1Gi\n  storageClassName: ebs-gp3\n  volumeMode: Block\n```\n\nThen create a pod that tries to mount it and /dev:\n\n```\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: test\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: test\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: test\n    spec:\n      containers:\n        - image: debian:bookworm\n          name: test\n          command:\n            - sleep\n            - infinity\n          volumeMounts:\n            - mountPath: /dev\n              name: dev\n          volumeDevices:\n            - devicePath: /disks/test\n              name: test\n      volumes:\n        - name: dev\n          hostPath:\n            path: /dev\n            type: Directory\n        - name: test\n          persistentVolumeClaim:\n            claimName: test\n\n```\n\nAnd observe that `/disks/test` is not created. If you remove the `/dev` volumeMount, `/disks/test` is created as expected.\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\nSeems somewhat similar to https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/85624 but the container being privileged doesn't matter in this case.\n\n### Kubernetes version\n\n<details>\n\n```console\n\u276f kubectl version\nClient Version: v1.32.4\nKustomize Version: v5.5.0\nServer Version: v1.32.3-eks-bcf3d70\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Cloud provider\n\n<details>\nAWS, using EKS\n</details>\n\n\n### OS version\n\n<details>\n\n```console\nNAME=\"Amazon Linux\"\nVERSION=\"2023\"\nID=\"amzn\"\nID_LIKE=\"fedora\"\nVERSION_ID=\"2023\"\nPLATFORM_ID=\"platform:al2023\"\nPRETTY_NAME=\"Amazon Linux 2023.7.20250414\"\nANSI_COLOR=\"0;33\"\nCPE_NAME=\"cpe:2.3:o:amazon:amazon_linux:2023\"\nHOME_URL=\"https://aws.amazon.com/linux/amazon-linux-2023/\"\nDOCUMENTATION_URL=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/linux/\"\nSUPPORT_URL=\"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/\"\nBUG_REPORT_URL=\"https://github.com/amazonlinux/amazon-linux-2023\"\nVENDOR_NAME=\"AWS\"\nVENDOR_URL=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\"\nSUPPORT_END=\"2029-06-30\"\n\nLinux 6.1.132-147.221.amzn2023.aarch64 #1 SMP Tue Apr  8 13:14:35 UTC 2025 aarch64 aarch64 aarch64 GNU/Linux\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Install tools\n\n<details>\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Container runtime (CRI) and version (if applicable)\n\n<details>\n> ctr version\nClient:\n  Version:  1.7.27\n  Revision: 05044ec0a9a75232cad458027ca83437aae3f4da\n  Go version: go1.23.7\n\nServer:\n  Version:  1.7.27\n  Revision: 05044ec\n...

What seems to be happening in 1.32 is that,  pod still uses the old annotation form for AppArmor so when we run `kubectl patch` to change something else, Kubernetes rebuilds the Pod spec internally using the new `securityContext.appArmorProfile` field. There is no step to copy the AppArmor value from the old annotation into the new field before calculating the diff, resulting in the Pod's internal version appearing to have no AppArmor profile. The diff logic treats this as a request to remove it.  In short, the backwards-compatibility logic that maps annotations to  `securityContext.appArmorProfile` is missing in the patch conversion flow\n---\n\nUser 'Goend' said:\n---\nI can't reproduce it.\n```\nroot@proxy-pass:~# kubectl  get pod test-fake -o yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  annotations:\n    container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/nginx-fake: localhost/cri-containerd.apparmor.d\n  creationTimestamp: \"2025-08-08T11:52:37Z\"\n  labels:\n    xx: xx\n  name: test-fake\n  namespace: default\n  resourceVersion: \"8145\"\n  uid: 9ca1df6d-8d8f-4d41-8e0b-7dc17c2242b1\nspec:\n  containers:\n  -

So they only have the annotation.\n---\n\nUser 'rickypeng99' said:\n---\n> I believe the problem comes from how patching works with the new `securityContext.appArmorProfile` field introduced in recent Kubernetes versions.

And yes the command that I used was a simple\n```\nkubectl patch pod <pod_name> -p '[{\"op\": \"remove\", \"path\": \"/metadata/labels/<label>\"}]' --type=json\n\n\n<omit other lines>\n-\u00a0                             AppArmorProfile: &core.AppArmorProfile{Type: \"Localhost\", LocalhostProfile: &\"<profile>\"},\n+\u00a0                             AppArmorProfile: nil,\n```\n\nDirectly patching the deployment template is fine\n```\nkubectl patch deployment <deployment> -p '[{\"op\": \"remove\", \"path\": \"/spec/template/metadata/labels/<label>\"}]' --type=json\nWarning: spec.template.metadata.annotations[container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/<container>]: deprecated since v1.30; use the \"appArmorProfile\" field instead\ndeployment.apps/<deployment> patched\n```\nBut I can't add the appArmorProfile in using `patch`\n```\n\u279c  ~ kubectl patch deployment <deployment> \\\n  --type strategic \\\n  -p '{\n    \"spec\": {\n      \"template\": {\n        \"spec\": {\n          \"containers\": [{\n            \"name\": \"<container>\",\n            \"securityContext\": {\n              \"appArmorProfile\": {\n                \"type\": \"Localhost\",\n                \"localhostProfile\": \"<profile?\"\n              }\n            }\n          }]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }'\n\ndeployment.apps/<deployment> patched\n```\nHowever if I describe the deployment again, nothing was updated. I raised another issue for this: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl/issues/1764\n---\n\nUser 'Goend' said:\n---\nCould you fully display the complete YAML of both the Pod you patched and the Deployment configuration? additionally, could you provide a full demonstration of the patching process for a Pod under a Deployment, exactly as I did above? have any custom webhooks or other extension mechanisms been deployed in the cluster?\n---\n\nUser 'rickypeng99' said:\n---\nThanks for the pointers, looks like by deleting an EKS addon that AWS provided (it will bring along a couple webhooks). The issue is then resolved. I will dive deeper into the underlying root cause, but thanks again for helping out.\n\nThe main reason why I was thinking of the problem of k8s itself, was due to the fact that I was upgrading our cluster versions.\n---\n\nUser 'Goend' said:\n---\nSo after the AWS-provided EKS plugin was removed, the patch pod operation could succeed, right?\nAs for kubernetes/kubectl#1764,  It seems a bit like a controller issue, and it might not be directly related to the CLI itself. I\u2019ll need to look into the code further.\n---\n\nUser 'rickypeng99' said:\n---\nYes, the patch pod operation is working now.\n---\n\nUser 'Goend' said:\n---\n/unassign\n---\n\nUser 'Goend' said:\n---\n/close\n---\n\nUser 'k8s-ci-robot' said:\n---\n@Goend: You can't close an active issue/PR unless you authored it or you are a collaborator.\n\n<details>\n\nIn response to [this](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/133416#issuecomment-3187208188):\n\n>/close\n\n\nInstructions for interacting with me using PR comments are available [here](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/guide/pull-requests.md).

Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\n### What happened?\n\nAPI Server panics when creating a CronJob with an invalid schedule format like `\"TZ=0\"`. This causes a slice bounds out of range error in the robfig/cron parser.\n\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nAPI Server should return a proper validation error instead of panic.\n\n\n### How can we reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?\n\n\n1. Create a CronJob YAML with invalid schedule:\n```yaml\napiVersion: batch/v1\nkind: CronJob\nmetadata:\n  name: daily-backup\nspec:\n  schedule: \"TZ=0\"  # Invalid: missing space and cron expression\n  jobTemplate:\n    spec:\n      template:\n        spec:\n          containers:\n          - name: backup\n            image: alpine\n            command: [\"/bin/sh\"]\n            args: [\"-c\", \"echo 'Starting backup...' && date\"]\n          restartPolicy: OnFailure\n```\n\n2.

Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\n### What happened?\n\nIn staging/src/k8s.io/client-go/rest/request.go, within the transformResponse function, the HTTP response body (resp.Body) is read using io.ReadAll, but is not explicitly closed afterward. According to Go best practices, failing to close the response body can lead to resource leaks, particularly file descriptors or sockets, over time or under high load.

For what purpose?\n---\n\nUser 'nareshku' said:\n---\nThanks for responding @BenTheElder. We have a distributed firewall mechanism that works alongside of kube-proxy. There are a few scenarios where the iptables can be flushed and 1hr wait time to recover isn't feasible for our environment.\n\nI see the till v1.32 the behavior is same, the latest code you shared appears to be applicable from v1.34 ref #131615.\n\n(Looks like the issue is very similar to #129128, linking here in case any wants to get more context.)\n---\n\nUser 'BenTheElder' said:\n---\n> There are a few scenarios where the iptables can be flushed and 1hr wait time to recover isn't feasible for our environment.\n\nRight, so you're *not* trying to use >1h then right?\n\nYou can set a lower interval, and the default is 30s (sync period) / 1s (min)\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/d5065bdf192b2ebb723657b3432c66ce3ea15b23/pkg/proxy/apis/config/v1alpha1/defaults.go#L62-L67\n\nIt's possible there was some confusion/overriding between config and flags?\n\n---\n\nEDIT: Clearly the flag info should be corrected to not suggest a value greater than the maximum, and to document the maximum.\n---\n\nUser 'aojea' said:\n---\n@danwinship is the expert of this area\n---\n\nUser 'nareshku' said:\n---\n>Right, so you're not trying to use >1h then right?\nNo, we actually want it to sync at a specified `--iptables-sync-period`.\n\nBased on the below code (<= v1.32), it only does sync at a 1 hour and doesn't honor `--iptables-sync-period`. You can check the below function call that handles the sync.\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.32/pkg/proxy/iptables/proxier.go#L328\n---\n\nUser 'danwinship' said:\n---\n> ```\n> An interval (e.g. '5s', '1m', '2h22m') indicating how frequently various re-synchronizing and cleanup operations are performed. Must be greater than 0.\n> ```\n> \n> However, the actual sync occurs every 1 hour.\n\nThe docs say that it controls \"various re-synchronizing and cleanup operations\". It doesn't say it controls every possible resync. (The docs are vague about exactly what it does, because it doesn't really do anything super useful any more, because the code doesn't work the same way it did when that option was added.)\n\n> We have a distributed firewall mechanism that works alongside of kube-proxy. There are a few scenarios where the iptables can be flushed and 1hr wait time to recover isn't feasible for our environment.\n\nkube-proxy assumes that when firewalls flush the iptables rules, they will flush _all_ iptables rules in all tables (because that's how all of the standard distro firewall services work). If you have your own firewall system and you need to flush iptables, you should do something like:\n\n```sh\nfor table in filter nat raw mangle; do\n    iptables -t ${table} -F\n    iptables -t ${table} -X\ndone\n```\n\nAnd kube-proxy will notice that and recover. (kube-proxy has to poll `mangle` rather than `nat` because iptables is terrible, and polling `nat` regularly would slow kube-proxy syncing down by creating contention for the iptables lock.)\n\n(This isn't documented because that's the way all firewall systems we were aware of already worked, so there didn't really seem to be any need to document it.)\n\n(And FTR, one of the things `--iptables-sync-period` controls is how often it polls to see if its canary chains have been deleted, so if the default 30s is too high, you can change that. Though, in that case, you should really try to make it so your firewall doesn't need to flush kube-proxy's rules...)\n---\n\nUser 'aojea' said:\n---\n@nareshku can you please check last comment and let us know if that is a valid answer? is it possible you can adapt your firewall mechanism to be compatible with kube-proxy logic?\n---\n\nUser 'danwinship' said:\n---\n/triage needs-information\n---\n\nUser 'nareshku' said:\n---\n> [@nareshku](https://github.com/nareshku) can you please check last comment and let us know if that is a valid answer? is it possible you can adapt your firewall mechanism to be compatible with kube-proxy logic?\n\nThanks @danwinship for detailed context.

{"instruction": "A user reported the following issue titled 'NCC-E003660-F9W: Common Certificate Authority Possible for Client CA and Request' in the 'kubernetes/kubernetes' repository. Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\n### NCC-E003660-F9W: Common Certificate Authority Possible for Client CA and Request\r\nHeader CA\r\nThis issue was reported in the [Kubernetes 1.24 Security Audit Report](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-security/blob/main/sig-security-external-audit/security-audit-2021-2022/findings/Kubernetes%20v1.24%20Final%20Report.pdf)\r\n\r\n**Impact**\r\nA misconfiguration of the API server could lead to a situation where privilege escalation for\r\nany authenticated user to cluster admin is possible.\r\n\r\n**Description**\r\nThe Kubernetes API server allows a certificate authority (CA) to be specified (using the `--\r\nclient-ca-file flag`) which will be used to verify client certificates under the familiar X.\r\n509 client certificate authentication scheme6. Another CA can be specified (using `--\r\nrequestheader-client-ca-file`) that will be used to verify requests authenticated using\r\nthe request header scheme (described in the documentation as Authenticating Proxy). If\r\nthese two CAs are the same, and the `--requestheader-allowed-names` flag is not used to\r\nspecify particular certificate common names that are permitted for request header\r\nauthentication, it is possible for any holder of a client certificate from the shared CA to\r\ntrivially authenticate to the API server as any user, by using their certificate to authenticate\r\na request using the request header scheme. While it is not intended that these CAs be the\r\nsame, and common Kubernetes deployment methods do not configure the deployment in\r\nthis way, it is possible that administrators could be unaware of this pitfall.\r\n\r\nThe Kubernetes documentation does include some advice against sharing CAs, but is not\r\nexplicit about the potentially serious security impact of this specific case.\r\n\r\nFor an example, please see the original finding on page 18 of the [Kubernetes 1.24 Security Audit Report](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-security/blob/main/sig-security-external-audit/security-audit-2021-2022/findings/Kubernetes%20v1.24%20Final%20Report.pdf)\r\n\r\n**Recommendation**\r\nThe Kubernetes API server should reject any configuration where `--client-ca-file` and\r\n`--requestheader-client-ca-file` are set to the same value, unless `--requestheaderallowed-\r\nnames` has been set to specific value(s).\r\n\r\nIt may also be advisable to update the Kubernetes documentation to be more explicit about\r\nthe specific risks of sharing certificate authorities. For example, using the same CA for X.\r\n509 client certificates for etcd authentication would allow any authenticated user to\r\ndirectly access etcd (although this scenario is considered less likely than sharing of the\r\nclient CA and request header CA).\r\n\r\n**Component**\r\nkube-apiserver\r\n\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**\r\nSee umbrella issue [#118980](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/118980) for current status of all issues created from these findings.\r\nThe vendor gave this issue an ID of NCC-E003660-F9W and it was finding 5 of the report under the kube-apiserver section.\r\nT\n...

{"instruction": "A user reported the following issue titled 'Kubelet Volume Manager can erroneously mark volume as unmounted.' in the 'kubernetes/kubernetes' repository. Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\n### What happened?\n\nWe observed an edge case where an API server transient issue can cause a volume to be marked as unmounted in the volume manager's ASW, and making the subsequent `NodeVolumeUnstage` calls to fail due to dangling publish mounts.\n\nThe sequence of events is:\n1. A map volume operation is kicked off.\n2. The API server has a transient issue, causing the map volume operation to fail with `Error: MapVolume.MarkVolumeAsMounted failed while expanding volume for volume $PVC`. This error happens after the `MapPodDevice` (and therefore the `NodePublishVolume`) call has already succeeded. This causes the volume mount to be marked as uncertain and the map to be requeued.\n3. When the operation retries,  the api server issue causes the MapPodDevice to fail with `blockMapper.publishVolumeForBlock failed to get NodePublishSecretRef`\n4. This error causes `markVolumeErrorState` to be called. The logic here[0] falls into a branch that marks the volume as unmounted in ASW, since the mount is marked uncertain.\n5. At this point the pod is deleted, so the map operation doesn't happen again. Since the volume is marked unmounted, the VM reconciler doesn't call unpublish for this pod and volume pair.\n\n[0] https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/56dd5ab10ff19aa9ebe438122a00472c4135de23/pkg/volume/util/operationexecutor/operation_generator.go#L819\n\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nAll volumes are unpublished correctly after the pod is deleted.\n\n### How can we reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?\n\nOnce `MapPodDevice` completes, trigger pod deletion and inject API failures. This should cause the pod to be deleted without unpublish being called.\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Kubernetes version\n\n<details>\n\n```console\n$ kubectl version\nClient Version: v1.28.3\nServer Version: v1.30.8\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Cloud provider\n\n<details>\n\n</details>\n\n\n### OS version\n\n<details>\n\n```console\n# On Linux:\n$ cat /etc/os-release\n# paste output here\n$ uname -a\n# paste output here\n\n# On Windows:\nC:\\> wmic os get Caption, Version, BuildNumber, OSArchitecture\n# paste output here\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Install tools\n\n<details>\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Container runtime (CRI) and version (if applicable)\n\n<details>\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Related plugins (CNI, CSI, ...) and versions (if applicable)\n\n<details>\n\nTrident CSI v25.06.1\n\n</details>", "response": "The issue was addressed with the following discussion:\n\nUser 'k8s-ci-robot' said:\n---\nThis issue is currently awaiting triage.\n\nIf a SIG or subproject determines this is a relevant issue, they will accept it by applying the `triage/accepted` label and provide further guidance.\n\nThe `triage/accepted` label can be added by org members by writing `/triage accepted` in a comment.\n\n\n<details>\n\nInstructions for interacting with me using PR comments are available [here](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/guide/pull-requests.md).

{"instruction": "A user reported the following issue titled 'kube-probe Host header is not RFC compliant by default' in the 'kubernetes/kubernetes' repository. Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\n### What happened?\n\nWhen kube-probe does a request based on the probe configured without `httpHeaders` set it sends `Host` header as a port  only, without hostname, which is not RFC-compliant.\n\nExample:\n```\nGET /healthcheck HTTP/1.1\nHost: :8283\nUser-Agent: kube-probe/1.30\nAccept: */*\nConnection: close\n```\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nWe expect `Host` header to have hostname set to Pod IP, as Pod IP is used by default when probe URL is generated.\n\n### How can we reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?\n\n```\n    readinessProbe:\n      httpGet:\n        path: /healthcheck\n        port: 8283\n```\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\nI think the problem comes from [this code](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/243d8c000e451da6f0e8f80704db5d5f672d3d18/pkg/probe/http/request.go#L63-L87).\n\nWhen headers are `nil` it generates new empty hash, sets some default values, but then does:\n\n```go\n\treq.Header = headers\n\treq.Host = headers.Get(\"Host\")\n```\n\nSo even if `req.Host` was previously set (I assume by `http.NewRequest`) it will be empty because `headers` doesn't have `\"Host\"` key by default.\n\n### Kubernetes version\n\n<details>\n\n```console\n# kubelet --version\nKubernetes v1.30.14\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Cloud provider\n\n<details>\nAWS\n</details>\n\n\n### OS version\n\n<details>\n\n```console\n# cat /etc/os-release\nNAME=\"Amazon Linux\"\nVERSION=\"2023\"\nID=\"amzn\"\nID_LIKE=\"fedora\"\nVERSION_ID=\"2023\"\nPLATFORM_ID=\"platform:al2023\"\nPRETTY_NAME=\"Amazon Linux 2023.8.20250818\"\nANSI_COLOR=\"0;33\"\nCPE_NAME=\"cpe:2.3:o:amazon:amazon_linux:2023\"\nHOME_URL=\"https://aws.amazon.com/linux/amazon-linux-2023/\"\nDOCUMENTATION_URL=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/linux/\"\nSUPPORT_URL=\"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/\"\nBUG_REPORT_URL=\"https://github.com/amazonlinux/amazon-linux-2023\"\nVENDOR_NAME=\"AWS\"\nVENDOR_URL=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\"\nSUPPORT_END=\"2029-06-30\"\n# uname -a\nLinux [REDACTED] 6.1.147-172.266.amzn2023.x86_64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Thu Aug  7 19:30:40 UTC 2025 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Install tools\n\n<details>\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Container runtime (CRI) and version (if applicable)\n\n<details>\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Related plugins (CNI, CSI, ...) and versions (if applicable)\n\n<details>\n\n</details>", "response": "The issue was addressed with the following discussion:\n\nUser 'k8s-ci-robot' said:\n---\nThis issue is currently awaiting triage.\n\nIf a SIG or subproject determines this is a relevant issue, they will accept it by applying the `triage/accepted` label and provide further guidance.\n\nThe `triage/accepted` label can be added by org members by writing `/triage accepted` in a comment.\n\n\n<details>\n\nInstructions for interacting with me using PR comments are available [here](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/guide/pull-requests.md).

This is simplified yaml from our real host which runs standalone `kubelet`:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: role-pod\nspec:\n  hostNetwork: true\n  containers:\n    - name: role-container\n      image: role-image\n      readinessProbe:\n        httpGet:\n          path: /healthcheck\n          port: 8283\n```\n\nAnd from my local go code experiments (based on the code from kubernetes http probe) this issue happens only when both `host` and `podIP` are `\"\"`.\n\nI've also tried upgrading kubelet to 1.34.1 but the issue persists:\n\n```\nGET /healthcheck HTTP/1.1\nHost: :8283\nUser-Agent: kube-probe/1.34\nAccept: */*\nConnection: close\n```\n\nI tried inspecting pod ip by adding env var:\n\n```yaml\n        - name: MY_POD_IP\n          valueFrom:\n            fieldRef:\n              fieldPath: status.podIP\n```\nand it's empty:\n```\n$ echo $MY_POD_IP\n\n$\n```\n\nUsing kubelet API:\n\n```\n# curl http://localhost:10255/pods | jq '.items[].status.podIP'\nnull\n```\n---"}

{"instruction": "A user reported the following issue titled 'AssumeCache may detect the PersistentVolume update later than the scheduler's event handlers' in the 'kubernetes/kubernetes' repository. Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\n### What happened?\n\nLet's say we have a scenario where Pod is rejected waiting for a PersistentVolume to be available.\nWhen the PersistentVolume status is updated to `Available`, the scheduler is notified via event handlers.\n\nOne of such handlers, in [eventhandling.go](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/18c188467d8ae00042b61f82aa159094336b657e/pkg/scheduler/eventhandlers.go#L566) is responsible for triggering the Pod's scheduling retry. In this case, the reason is valid, so the Pod is placed in the activeQ (or backoffQ) and then taken to the scheduling.\n\nHowever, during the (pre)filtering of VolumeBinding plugin, the PersistentVolume objects are [listed](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/18c188467d8ae00042b61f82aa159094336b657e/pkg/scheduler/framework/plugins/volumebinding/binder.go#L825) from the plugin's AssumeCache, which have its own set of the [event handlers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/18c188467d8ae00042b61f82aa159094336b657e/pkg/scheduler/util/assumecache/assume_cache.go#L208-L214). If these handlers receive the PV update event later than the main scheduler's handlers, VolumeBinding takes the decision based on an old data, e.g. a PersistentVolume with an old state. As a result, the Pod is [rejected](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/18c188467d8ae00042b61f82aa159094336b657e/pkg/scheduler/framework/plugins/volumebinding/binder.go#L885) and goes back to the scheduling queue.\n\nUltimately, there won't be any event that would wake up such Pod again, so it will wait indefinitely (precisely, it will be retried by the flushing mechanism that we would like to eventually remove).\n\nThis behavior causes the `volumescheduling` integration test to flake: https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-master-blocking#integration-master\n\n/sig scheduling\n/sig storage\n/kind flake\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nVolumeBinding should have a consistent view of PersistentVolumes with the main scheduler's event handlers.\n\n### How can we reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?\n\nRun the integration tests with low parallelism:\n```sh\nKUBE_INTEGRATION_TEST_MAX_CONCURRENCY=2 make test-integration WHAT=\"test/integration/volumescheduling\" KUBE_TEST_ARGS=\"-run TestVolumeBindingRescheduling\"\n```\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Kubernetes version\n\n<details>\n\n```console\n$ kubectl version\n# paste output here\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Cloud provider\n\n<details>\n\n</details>\n\n\n### OS version\n\n<details>\n\n```console\n# On Linux:\n$ cat /etc/os-release\n# paste output here\n$ uname -a\n# paste output here\n\n# On Windows:\nC:\\> wmic os get Caption, Version, BuildNumber, OSArchitecture\n# paste output here\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Install tools\n\n<details>\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Container runtime (CRI) and version (if applicable)\n\n<details>\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Related plugins (CNI, CSI, ...) and versions (if applicable)\n\n<details>\n\n</details>", "response": "The issue was addressed with the following discussion:\n\nUser 'k8s-ci-robot' said:\n---\nThis issue is currently awaiting triage.\n\nIf a SIG or subproject determines this is a relevant issue, they will accept it by applying the `triage/accepted` label and provide further guidance.\n\nThe `triage/accepted` label can be added by org members by writing `/triage accepted` in a comment.\n\n\n<details>\n\nInstructions for interacting with me using PR comments are available [here](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/guide/pull-requests.md).

That functionality didn't exist in the assume cache when it was added for volumes, but it is there now for exactly this purpose.\n---\n\nUser 'huww98' said:\n---\nFor the fix, I propose that instead of listening for update event in AssumeCache and update a secondary cache, we just read the PV from informer cache directly and exclude the ones that is already bound by scheduler.\n\nCompared to the fix proposed by @pohly , I think my proposal would make the overall system complexity lower. We don't need the scheduler framework to be aware of our assume cache. And we reduce one level of asynchronous and one level of cache store.\n\nAnd as written in the comment of Assume()\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/ef4add4509a479dab1f34369dacb7e65a3fa2e81/pkg/scheduler/util/assumecache/assume_cache.go#L425-L426\nOur current usage is unsafe actually. We may take the chance to also fix this.\n---\n\nUser 'msau42' said:\n---\nI am ok with the approach in `Get()` to read from the cache and compare directly with the informer, instead of copying the informer object into the cache.\n---"}
{"instruction": "A user reported the following issue titled '[kubelet] time shift and `failed to reserve container name`' in the 'kubernetes/kubernetes' repository. Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\n### What happened?\n\nAfter a liveness failure the kubelet tried to restart the container `test-container`. The node clock stepped backwards about 40 seconds at the same moment. Because `podWorkerLoop` calls `podCache.GetNewerThan(podUID, lastSyncTime)`, the cached pod status never looked newer than the saved `lastSyncTime`. The kubelet kept the old `RestartCount`, called `CreateContainer` again with attempt `1`, and containerd returned:\n\n```\nfailed to reserve container name \"test-container_test-container-68b789996c-q9kxh_d8-cloud-instance-manager_fe9ba7d1-5308-44ef-a81c-83133bf88c50_1\": name ... is reserved for \"d553f9f992855e898c29b05b6487da56580ab760db155bfd90da20e8fe8a98bc\"\n```\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\n\nEven if the node clock jumps backwards, kubelet should notice that the previous container already exists and should wait for a fresh pod status before calling `CreateContainer` again. The restart attempt should be `2`, not `1`, so containerd does not reject the request\n\n### How can we reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?\n\n1. Run Kubernetes v1.31.10 with containerd on a test node.\n2. Deploy any pod that continuously crashes (e.g. fails liveness probe so it loops in `CrashLoopBackOff`).\n3. On the same node run:\n\n```bash\nwhile true\ndo\n     sudo date -s \"+10 minutes\"\n     sleep 1\n     sudo date -s \"-10 minutes\"\n     sleep 1\ndone\n ```\n\n4. Watch kubelet and containerd logs. After several restarts you will see kubelet making a second `CreateContainer` call with attempt `1`, followed by containerd logging `failed to reserve container name`.\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\n```\nI0918 16:09:49.994636     550 kuberuntime_container.go:808] \"Killing container with a grace period\" pod=\"d8-cloud-instance-manager/bashible-apiserver-68b789996c-q9kxh\" containerID=\"containerd://c42fbc64c45cd657eeaceee5c2326f3e64057d551d9340629670487c0247e0c5\"\nE0918 16:08:41.636161     550 log.go:32] \"CreateContainer in sandbox from runtime service failed\" err=\"rpc error: code = Unknown desc = failed to reserve container name ...\"\n```\n\n### Kubernetes version\n\n<details>\n\n```console\n$ kubectl version\nClient Version: v1.31.0\nServer Version: v1.31.10\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Cloud provider\n\n<details>\n\n</details>\n\n\n### OS version\n\n<details>\n\n```console\n# On Linux:\n$ cat /etc/os-release\n# paste output here\n$ uname -a\n# paste output here\n\n# On Windows:\nC:\\> wmic os get Caption, Version, BuildNumber, OSArchitecture\n# paste output here\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Install tools\n\n<details>\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Container runtime (CRI) and version (if applicable)\n\n<details>\ncontainerd 1.7.x\n</details>\n\n\n### Related plugins (CNI, CSI, ...) and versions (if applicable)\n\n<details>\n\n</details>", "response": "The issue was addressed with the following discussion:\n\nUser 'k8s-ci-robot' said:\n---\nThis issue is currently awaiting triage.\n\nIf a SIG or subproject determines this is a relevant issue, they will accept it by applying the `triage/accepted` label and provide further guidance.\n\nThe `triage/accepted` label can be added by org members by writing `/triage accepted` in a comment.\n\n\n<details>\n\nInstructions for interacting with me using PR comments are available [here](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/guide/pull-requests.md).

{"instruction": "A user reported the following issue titled 'CVE-2020-8554: Man in the middle using LoadBalancer or ExternalIPs' in the 'kubernetes/kubernetes' repository. Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\nCVSS Rating: **Medium** ([CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L))\r\n \r\nThis issue affects multitenant clusters. If a potential attacker can already create or edit services and pods, then they may be able to intercept traffic from other pods (or nodes) in the cluster.\r\n \r\nAn attacker that is able to create a ClusterIP service and set the spec.externalIPs field can intercept traffic to that IP. An attacker that is able to patch the status (which is considered a privileged operation and should not typically be granted to users) of a LoadBalancer service can set the status.loadBalancer.ingress.ip to similar effect.\r\nThis issue is a design flaw that cannot be mitigated without user-facing changes.\r\n### Affected Components and Configurations\r\n\r\nAll Kubernetes versions are affected. Multi-tenant clusters that grant tenants the ability to create and update services and pods are most vulnerable.\r\n### Mitigations\r\n\r\nThere is no patch for this issue, and it can currently only be mitigated by restricting access to the vulnerable features. Because an in-tree fix would require a breaking change, we will open a conversation about a longer-term fix or built-in mitigation after the embargo is lifted\r\n\r\nTo restrict the use of external IPs we are providing an admission webhook container: k8s.gcr.io/multitenancy/externalip-webhook:v1.0.0. The source code and deployment instructions are published at https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/externalip-webhook.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, external IPs can be restricted using [OPA Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper). A sample ConstraintTemplate and Constraint can be found here: https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper-library/tree/master/library/general/externalip.\r\n\r\nNo mitigations are provided for LoadBalancer IPs since we do not recommend granting users *patch service/status* permission. If LoadBalancer IP restrictions are required, the approach for the external IP mitigations can be copied.\r\n### Detection\r\n\r\nExternalIP services are not widely used, so we recommend manually auditing any external IP usage.

May either more detail or a POC be provided?\n---\n\nUser 'dharmab' said:\n---\nI'm particularly confused by this line:\r\n\r\n> An attacker that is able to create a ClusterIP service and set the spec.externalIPs field can intercept traffic to that IP.\r\n\r\nIs traffic intercepted if the client is using the service discovery name or another DNS name that resolves to the targeted IP? Or is this only intercepted if the client uses the IP address without DNS?\n---\n\nUser 'tallclair' said:\n---\nIf you create a service with an arbitrary external IP, then traffic to that external IP from within the cluster will be routed to that service. This lets an attacker that has permission to create a service with an external IP to intercept traffic to any target IP.\r\n\r\nThe routing happens at the IP layer, so I don't think it matters if they use DNS or not (once DNS resolves to the target IP, I think it will still be intercepted).\n---\n\nUser 'dharmab' said:\n---\nAh, I see. So I could create a Service like this to intercept some or all UDP traffic from Pods in the cluster to Google DNS:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\napiVersion: v1\r\nkind: Service\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: my-evil-service\r\n  namespace: my-evil-namespace\r\nspec:\r\n  selector:\r\n    app: my-evil-dns-server\r\n  ports:\r\n    - name: dns\r\n      protocol: UDP\r\n      port: 53\r\n      targetPort: 9053\r\n  externalIPs:\r\n    - 8.8.8.8\r\n    - 8.8.4.4\r\n```\n---\n\nUser 'tallclair' said:\n---\nI'm closing this issue, since https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/97110 captures the follow up items.\n---\n\nUser 'champtar' said:\n---\nI'll try to finish my write up tonight, but when I did all my tests `externalIPs` were not working in some cases where `LoadBalancer` was working.\r\nEDIT: Here the write up: https://blog.champtar.fr/K8S_MITM_LoadBalancer_ExternalIPs/\n---\n\nUser 'danquack' said:\n---\nFor those looking to reproduce from the above ^\r\n```\r\n~ kubectl run nginx --image nginx:latest --port 80\r\n~ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -\r\napiVersion: v1\r\nkind: Service\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: my-evil-service\r\nspec:\r\n  selector:\r\n    run: nginx\r\n  type: LoadBalancer\r\n  ports:\r\n    - name: http\r\n      protocol: TCP\r\n      port: 80\r\n      targetPort: 80\r\n  externalIPs:\r\n    - 23.185.0.3 #cncf.io\r\nEOF\r\n~ kubectl get service\r\nNAME              TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE\r\nkubernetes        ClusterIP      10.96.0.1      <none>        443/TCP        25d\r\nmy-evil-service   LoadBalancer   10.97.145.71   23.185.0.3    80:30904/TCP   47m\r\n~  kubectl run --rm -i --tty curl --image=curlimages/curl --restart=Never -- curl -I http://cncf.io\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nServer: nginx/1.19.5\r\nDate: Tue, 08 Dec 2020 02:22:21 GMT\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\nContent-Length: 612\r\nLast-Modified: Tue, 24 Nov 2020 13:02:03 GMT\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\nETag: \"5fbd044b-264\"\r\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\r\n...\r\n~  kubectl run --rm -i --tty curl --image=curlimages/curl --restart=Never -- curl -I http://23.185.0.3\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nServer: nginx/1.19.5\r\nDate: Tue, 08 Dec 2020 02:17:52 GMT\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\nContent-Length: 612\r\nLast-Modified: Tue, 24 Nov 2020 13:02:03 GMT\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\nETag: \"5fbd044b-264\"\r\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\r\n...\r\n```\n---\n\nUser 'champtar' said:\n---\n@maplain just edited my message, with my write-up link, you will find in it how to patch the status easily\r\n@danquack you are using `type: LoadBalancer` and `externalIPs`, never tried that, does it change anything compared to `type: ClusterIP`\n---\n\nUser 'maplain' said:\n---\n>you are using type: LoadBalancer and externalIPs, never tried that, does it change anything compared to type: ClusterIP\r\n\r\nI actually tried to set `externalIP` and `loadBalancerIP` both using `type: loadBalancer`.

In my local environment, external IP hangs in pending, so that's why I went with externalIPs over loadBalancerIP\r\n```\r\n~ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -\r\napiVersion: v1\r\nkind: Service\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: my-evil-service\r\nspec:\r\n  selector:\r\n    run: nginx\r\n  type: ClusterIP\r\n  ports:\r\n    - name: http\r\n      protocol: TCP\r\n      port: 80\r\n      targetPort: 80\r\n  externalIPs:\r\n    - 23.185.0.3 #cncf.io\r\nEOF\r\n ~ kubectl run --rm -i --tty curl --image=curlimages/curl --restart=Never -- curl -I http://cncf.io\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nServer: nginx/1.19.5\r\n```\n---\n\nUser 'champtar' said:\n---\n@maplain what LoadBalancer are you using ? if just setting `loadBalancerIP` make the LB patch the status with this IP this is a problem\n---\n\nUser 'borgerli' said:\n---\nThanks.

However, conceptually \"FOO.COM\" and \"Foo.com\" are different drivers because all string comparisons compare the strings literally.\n\nWe should:\n- Document the driver name fields as \"this allows upper-case names but is not caseless - it treats upper-case and lower-case as different values\". This applies to the fields and the CEL expression documentation.\n- Warn about driver names with upper characters. We can do this for fields, but not for CEL expressions (or not easily there).\n\n/wg device-management\n/priority backlog\n\n\n### Why is this needed?\n\nLess surprises for users.

You can probably find some other implementations to see what such warnings should look like.\n\nI think it's sufficient to warn for ResourceSlices. If a driver ignores the guidance and publishes a its slices with mixed or upper case driver name, then all downstream components like the scheduler have no choice and have to use that name.

I assume that the decoded object was `UnstructuredList`.\r\n\r\nI think that the `WatchList` should also be able to decode successfully into `UnstructuredList` regardless of the requested encoding. If the requested encoding is unsupported, then the `WatchList` request could/should return an error.\n---\n\nUser 'xuzhenglun' said:\n---\nThank @p0lyn0mial for reply.\r\n\r\nYes, the standard list returns `UnstructuredList` sucessfully when response is `Table`, and no error happened. Alrougth `Table` is not a list,  but `Unstructured` can do `ToList` method successfully, and the output is `&UnstructuredList{Object: obj.Object}` (field Items is nil in this case). However, `ListWatch` return an error for now, and the behavior of `List` and `WatchList` are different.\r\n\r\nI'm agree with you that `List` and `WatchList` should only support object can be decoded into `UnstructuredList`, but I'm not sure that if this difference can be considered as breaking compatibility?\r\n\r\nBeside of the encoding issue, the thing what I'm really worried about is the initial-end bookmark event is strange when response is a table: `metadata.annotation` is not available in the root of the object, but it's placed in `rows[0].object.metadata.annotation`. And the worst thing is that even `rows[0].object.metadata.annotation` can be unavailiable if `includeObject=None` param is set, since `rows[0].object` will be `nil`.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to add `WatchList` support for `kubectl`, so I was wondering if I could reuse the `WatchList` code in the `rest client` instead of implementing one myself. The `includeObject=None` parameter doesn't matter to me for what I'm doing, but I'm not sure if other people use it. So I wanted to ask your opinion on this.\n---\n\nUser 'p0lyn0mial' said:\n---\nSince we are trying to replace `List` with `WatchList`, I think the new method should also be able to decode data, even if the response is a Table. \r\n\r\nI had to roll back the graduation of the feature, so it is turned off by default. Before enabling the feature we should consider fixing this issue.\r\n\r\nI don't think that placing the `initial-end bookmark annotation` on `rows[0].object` is specific to the `WatchList`.

I believe this is where objects are generally placed when a user requests a Table. \r\n\r\nYes, `initial-end bookmark annotation` is always placed in `rows[0].object` when requesting a Table. But there are two small problems when we are using `WatchList` with this behavior:\r\n\r\n1. `Table` need a special treatment likes below, and it looks weird. It's just a nit, no big deal.\r\n```patch\r\n+func metaAccessor(object runtime.Object) (metav1.Object, error) {\r\n+\ttable, ok := object.(*metav1.Table)\r\n+\tif ok {\r\n+\t\tif len(table.Rows) == 0 || len(table.Rows[0].Object.Raw) == 0 {\r\n+\t\t\treturn nil, fmt.Errorf(\"unexcept empty Table\")\r\n+\t\t}\r\n+\r\n+\t\tconverted, err := runtime.Decode(unstructured.UnstructuredJSONScheme, table.Rows[0].Object.Raw)\r\n+\t\tif err != nil {\r\n+\t\t\treturn nil, err\r\n+\t\t}\r\n+\r\n+\t\treturn meta.Accessor(converted)\r\n+\t}\r\n+\r\n+\treturn meta.Accessor(object)\r\n+}\r\n\r\n // handleWatchList holds the actual logic for easier unit testing.\r\n // Note that this function will close the passed watch.\r\n func (r *Request) handleWatchList(ctx context.Context, w watch.Interface) WatchListResult {\r\n \t\t\tif event.Type == watch.Error {\r\n \t\t\t\treturn WatchListResult{err: errors.FromObject(event.Object)}\r\n \t\t\t}\r\n-\t\t\tmeta, err := meta.Accessor(event.Object)\r\n+\t\t\tmeta, err := metaAccessor(event.Object)\r\n \t\t\tif err != nil {\r\n \t\t\t\treturn WatchListResult{err: fmt.Errorf(\"failed to parse watch event: %#v\", event)}\r\n \t\t\t}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. If the WatchList request with `includeObject=None` params, the `initial-end bookmark annotation` will never been seen by client. I'm not sure if we can accept that it's just not supported. For example, the bookmark event will looks like:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"BOOKMARK\",\r\n  \"object\": {\r\n    \"kind\": \"Table\",\r\n    \"apiVersion\": \"meta.k8s.io/v1\",\r\n    \"metadata\": {\r\n      \"resourceVersion\": \"679930\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"columnDefinitions\": null,\r\n    \"rows\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"cells\": [\r\n          \"\",\r\n          \"0/0\",\r\n          \"\",\r\n          \"0\",\r\n          \"<unknown>\",\r\n          \"<none>\",\r\n          \"<none>\",\r\n          \"<none>\",\r\n          \"<none>\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"object\": null\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\n---\n\nUser 'xuzhenglun' said:\n---\n@p0lyn0mial \r\n\r\nI just submited a PR  https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126363 which trying to address this issue.

{"instruction": "A user reported the following issue titled 'Document and test minimum privileges needed to run kube-proxy' in the 'kubernetes/kubernetes' repository. Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\n### What happened?\n\nRunning containers in privileged mode is not recommended as privileged containers run with all [linux capabilities](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html) enabled and can access the host's resources. Running containers in privileged mode opens number of security threads such as breakout to underlying host OS.\r\n\r\nCurrently the kube-proxy DaemonSet runs in privileged mode.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/863a462eeccca4c24bf4c4e9012f5ebccade70a2/cluster/addons/kube-proxy/kube-proxy-ds.yaml#L50-L51\r\n\r\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubelet-in-userns/#configuring-kube-proxy describes how to run kube-proxy in \"rootless\". To my understanding \"rootless\" != non-privileged mode but this configuration can be also used for running in non-privileged mode. However I see that following issues with it:\r\n1. In the provided kube-proxy component config in https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubelet-in-userns/#configuring-kube-proxy we have to disable certain settins to prevent kube-proxy from ensuring sysctls (which is allowed only in privileged container).\r\n\r\nBut when I tried to run kube-proxy with the provided component config it fails because it tries to ensure yet another syctl:\r\n```\r\nF0818 08:03:55.514875       1 server.go:494] unable to create proxier: unable to create ipv4 proxier: can't set sysctl net/ipv4/conf/all/route_localnet to 1: open /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/route_localnet: read-only file system\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is `net/ipv4/conf/all/route_localnet` that is being set in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/58c10aa6eb5adfb1f3aa4d6cb898b8c347ba9e72/pkg/proxy/iptables/proxier.go#L263-L265\r\n\r\nAnd I don't see a way how to disable kube-proxy from ensuring this sysctl from its component config.\r\n\r\n2. In general the whole approach that explicitly sets 0 values to prevent kube-proxy from ensuring syctls seems not a sustainable one. The long lived kube-proxy container should be able to run in non-privileged mode. If it needs sysctls to be ensured, this can to be done in a privileged init container.\r\n\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nI would expect to be able to run kube-proxy in non-privileged mode in a clear and sustainable way.\n\n### How can we reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?\n\nSee above.\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Kubernetes version\n\n<details>\r\n\r\nv1.24.3\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\n\n### Cloud provider\n\n<details>\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\n\n### OS version\n\n<details>\r\n\r\n```console\r\n# On Linux:\r\n$ cat /etc/os-release\r\n# paste output here\r\n$ uname -a\r\n# paste output here\r\n\r\n# On Windows:\r\nC:\\> wmic os get Caption, Version, BuildNumber, OSArchitecture\r\n# paste output here\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\n\n### Install tools\n\n<details>\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\n\n### Container runtime (CRI) and version (if applicable)\n\n<details>\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\n\n### Related plugins (CNI, CSI, ...) and versions (if applicable)\n\n<details>\r\n\r\n</details>", "response": "The issue was addressed with the following discussion:\n\nUser 'k8s-ci-robot' said:\n---\n@ialidzhikov: This issue is currently awaiting triage.\n\nIf a SIG or subproject determines this is a relevant issue, they will accept it by applying the `triage/accepted` label and provide further guidance.\n\nThe `triage/accepted` label can be added by org members by writing `/triage accepted` in a comment.\n\n\n<details>\n\nInstructions for interacting with me using PR comments are available [here](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/guide/pull-requests.md).

{"instruction": "A user reported the following issue titled 'Frequent churn between EndpointSlice objects' in the 'kubernetes/kubernetes' repository. Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\n### What happened?\n\nWe are running a single control-plane k3s cluster in our lab. The cluster has about 56 high-power bare metal nodes. The cluster is used primarily by our developers and our CICD. We create kubevirt VMs for dev and testing. \n\nRecently as our cluster grew to serve a 100+ kubevirt VMs (running in pods), we noticed significant uptick in the number of ssh and nslookup failures by our CICD system when trying to communicate with the VMs. On average, we would see 1 in 100 or so attempts fail to resolve the VMs IP address. The lookups happened based on the VM name. We use a single headless Service for all of our VMs. \n\nWe wrote a small script to see if we could reproduce the issue. The script would send DNS lookups (dig) to all running healthy VMs (VM status = ready). We noticed that coredns would occasionally return NXDOMAIN for perfectly healthy VMs. Importantly, those VMs were not going through any state transition. The NXDOMIANs would be short-lived, usually < 10 seconds and then it go back to resolving correctly. Again, it's important to note that the VMs(and their pods) for which the NXDOMAIN was received were not transitioning states during this period. \n\nTo see why coredns would behave this way, we wrote another program to watch for updates on the EndpointSlice object. What we noticed was that when the number of endpoints per slice grew greater than 100 (the default value), then, as expected, a new slice would be created. However, what would happen next was surprising. The two endpointslices would start to exhibit significant churn, where endpoints would be frequently be removed from one slice and added to the other. Here is a snippet for the two slices: tortuga-4frcm and tortuga-sxqh9. The program logs the type of event (e.g. MODIFIED) and what changed (i.e. it does a diff between the old and new object). Note that this is not a onetime thing, the churn continues for prolonged periods. The vast majority of VMs being shuffled are not going through any state transition. They are just sitting idle. \n\n```\n2025/07/24 22:34:09 EVENT [endpointslices]: Type: MODIFIED | Name: **tortuga-4frcm** | Change: endpoint count changed from 35 to 34, added IP: 10.42.59.53 (ready: true), added IP: 10.42.1.234 (ready: true), added IP: 10.42.4.164 (ready: true), added IP: 10.42.12.42 (ready: true), added IP: 10.42.61.70 (ready: true), added IP: 10.42.3.147 (ready: true), added IP: 10.42.3.145 (ready: true), added IP: 10.42.19.136 (ready: true), added IP: 10.42.31.23 (ready: true), added IP: 10.42.57.87 (ready: true), added IP: 10.42.57.84 (ready: true), added IP: 10.42.32.34 (ready: true), added IP: 10.42.8.181 (ready: true), added IP: 10.42.17.106 (ready: true), added IP: 10.42.7.57 (ready: true), added IP: 10.42.34.117 (ready: true), added IP: 10.42.56.229 (ready: true), added IP: 10.42.61.66 (ready: true), added IP: 10.42.9.155 (ready: true), added IP: 10.42.28.211 (ready: true), added IP: 10.42.10.143 (ready: true), added IP: 10.42.34.113 (ready\n...

[11-false]). This can cause a pod rejection, depending on Topology Manager policy. \r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\nAppContainer to be placed on the same NUMA node as InitContainer, if there is enough resources (and inherit InitContainer CPUs). If not, it should be placed on another NUMA node and CPUs used by InitContainer should be released back to the pool. \r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\nLeave small amount of free CPUs on NUMA0, enough to fit InitContainer, but not enough to fit AppContainer. On NUMA1 there should be enough CPUs to fit AppContainer.\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\nPart of the code that is responsible for discarding other hints: \r\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/kubelet/cm/cpumanager/policy_static.go#L384-L392\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`): v1.19.0-rc.4.190+436f1afaf30c22\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration:\r\n- OS (e.g: `cat /etc/os-release`):\r\n- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`):\r\n- Install tools:\r\n- Network plugin and version (if this is a network-related bug):\r\n- Others:", "response": "The issue was addressed with the following discussion:\n\nUser 'k-wiatrzyk' said:\n---\n/sig node\n---\n\nUser 'k8s-ci-robot' said:\n---\n@k-wiatrzyk: The label(s) `sig/, sig/` cannot be applied, because the repository doesn't have them\n\n<details>\n\nIn response to [this](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/94220#issuecomment-679989599):\n\n>/sig node \r\n> \n\n\nInstructions for interacting with me using PR comments are available [here](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/guide/pull-requests.md).

The init container will likely get CPU 6 allocated to it, and then we will attempt to reuse that CPU to allocate to the app container (which needs 5 CPUs). Since there are only 4 CPUs available on NUMA node 0 where CPU 6 lives \u2014 the app container ends up being rejected since it can\u2019t reuse CPU 6 and be allocated to NUMA node 0 (even though it could easily be allocated on NUMA node 1)._ \"\n---\n\nUser 'k-wiatrzyk' said:\n---\n/assign klueska\n---\n\nUser 'pablitoergosum' said:\n---\nI refactored above TC and managed to include it into ``TestGetTopologyHints`` function: [test case](https://github.com/k-wiatrzyk/kubernetes/commit/63925565fc871ae7a84420120196df1bd19f80ad)\r\nThis is only indicator of unwanted funcionality for now, so it fails. It will pass, when solution to the issue is implemented.\n---\n\nUser 'k-wiatrzyk' said:\n---\nI was investigating the following solutions:\r\n\r\nCPU Inheritance:\r\n1) Hints that can't allow inheritance of all InitContainer's CPUs are stored as alternative hints - not discarded as it is done now.\r\n2) If affinity (number of NUMA nodes) of alternative hints is lesser than smallest in normal hints, then include alternative hints. \r\nSo this is only adding addition logic into `generateCPUTopologyHints`\r\n\r\nReleasing InitContainer's CPUs that are not used anymore (it requires some refactoring):\r\n1) Adding a struct describing pod in the state which would include:\r\n  - `appContainersIDs` - slice of IDs\r\n  - `reusableCPUs` for this pod - moved from policy\r\n  - `containerCPUAssignments` for the pod could be moved in here\r\n2) When pod is admitted app containers IDs are saved `appContainersIDs`\r\n3) IIUC Manager's function `AddContainer()` is called before each container start. So, when `AddContainer()` function is called on first app container (it is checked through the state), this means that all InitContainers have executed and `reusableCPUs` won't be used anymore and can be cleared (released to the pool of available CPUs - `defaultCPUSet`)\r\n\r\nThis solution won't require any higher-level changed. Maybe another solution could implement some Post Stop notification that will inform CPU Manager that container has executed and it can release resources.\n---\n\nUser 'fejta-bot' said:\n---\nIssues go stale after 90d of inactivity.\nMark the issue as fresh with `/remove-lifecycle stale`.\nStale issues rot after an additional 30d of inactivity and eventually close.\n\nIf this issue is safe to close now please do so with `/close`.\n\nSend feedback to sig-testing, kubernetes/test-infra and/or [fejta](https://github.com/fejta).\n/lifecycle stale\n---\n\nUser 'klueska' said:\n---\n/remove-lifecycle stale\n---\n\nUser 'fejta-bot' said:\n---\nIssues go stale after 90d of inactivity.\nMark the issue as fresh with `/remove-lifecycle stale`.\nStale issues rot after an additional 30d of inactivity and eventually close.\n\nIf this issue is safe to close now please do so with `/close`.\n\nSend feedback to sig-contributor-experience at [kubernetes/community](https://github.com/kubernetes/community).\n/lifecycle stale\n---\n\nUser 'fejta-bot' said:\n---\nStale issues rot after 30d of inactivity.\nMark the issue as fresh with `/remove-lifecycle rotten`.\nRotten issues close after an additional 30d of inactivity.\n\nIf this issue is safe to close now please do so with `/close`.\n\nSend feedback to sig-contributor-experience at [kubernetes/community](https://github.com/kubernetes/community).\n/lifecycle rotten\n---\n\nUser 'klueska' said:\n---\n/remove-lifecycle rotten\n---\n\nUser 'ehashman' said:\n---\n/cc @fromanirh @swatisehgal @cynepco3hahue \r\n/triage accepted\n---\n\nUser 'klueska' said:\n---\nSome more background about this issue -- it is definitely a bug, but it is only exploitable on an uncommon edge case, where an init container asks for a smaller number of exclusive cpus than an app container does.\r\n\r\nThe common cases are:\r\n1) init containers do not ask for any exclusive CPUs at all\r\n2) init containers ask for the same number of CPUs as their app container\r\n\r\nWhile I agree this issue should be fixed to provide the expected behaviour in the long term, it should be considered low prioirity, since it likely won't be an issue in practice.

{"instruction": "A user reported the following issue titled 'Deployment rollout status not reliable when using `status.conditions`' in the 'kubernetes/kubernetes' repository. Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\n### What happened?\n\nCurrently I am working on a project where we implement a Kubernetes operator and we decided that for some flows we will need to wait for some deployments to complete the rollout before advancing to some other steps from our processes.\r\nSo, for an old deployment we only update an image in the pod template and then we wait for the updated deployment to finish the rollout.\r\n\r\nThe way the status of the Deployment is built/implemented is error prone and not reliable if we only take into account the `status.conditions` (as suggested in the documentation)\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nAfter updating the spec of a deployment, when the `status.ObservedGeneration` is changed to the latest `metadata.Generation`, the `status.conditions` should also be updated.\n\n### How can we reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?\n\nWe found out that if:\r\n- we start with a Deployment having a `status.condition` of type `Progressing` with the reason `ProgressDeadlineExceeded`\r\n- update the deployment spec (the only change would be an image from a container from the pod template)\r\n- on a timer (every second), start retrieving the deployment using the API and check the status\r\nThen, under some circumstances (so, not always; it's a concurrency/timing issue), the first change of the `status.observedGeneration` toward the new `metadata.generation` value, comes with *no change*(!) in the `status.conditions` (the old conditions are still there *without any single change*(!)). \r\nAccording to the Kubernetes documentation (and also the way the Operator SDK checks this rollout status), the interpretation of these would lead to say that the rollout failed, which is not accurate, because the actual rollout will only start a few seconds later...\r\n\r\nThis is an example from a log describing the issue (please observe that the two blocks are logged at a few milliseconds distance and the `status.conditions` are the same even the `status.ObservedGeneration` changed):\r\n```\r\n# 10:53:18.814 > Metadata.Generation: 2 | Status >> ObservedGeneration: 1, replicas: 1 , readyReplicas: , availableReplicas: , updatedReplicas: 1, unAvailableReplicas: 1\r\n  Conditions:\r\n    @10-Apr-24 10:53:02 | 10-Apr-24 10:53:02 | Available | False | MinimumReplicasUnavailable | Deployment does not have minimum availability.\r\n    @10-Apr-24 10:53:18 | 10-Apr-24 10:53:18 | Progressing | False | ProgressDeadlineExceeded | ReplicaSet \"my-deployment-5b8dc498c\" has timed out progressing.\r\n => completed: False, failed: False\r\n\r\n# 10:53:18.818 > Metadata.Generation: 2 | Status >> ObservedGeneration: 2, replicas: 1 , readyReplicas: , availableReplicas: , updatedReplicas: , unAvailableReplicas: 1\r\n  Conditions:\r\n    @10-Apr-24 10:53:02 | 10-Apr-24 10:53:02 | Available | False | MinimumReplicasUnavailable | Deployment does not have minimum availability.\r\n    @10-Apr-24 10:53:18 | 10-Apr-24 10:53:18 | Progressing | False | ProgressDeadlineExceeded | ReplicaSet \"my-deployment-5b8dc498c\" has time\n...

{"instruction": "A user reported the following issue titled 'kubelet fails with `UnmountVolume.NewUnmounter failed for volume` and `vol_data.json: no such file or directory` for CSI volumes and floods the logs' in the 'kubernetes/kubernetes' repository. Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\n### What happened?\n\nI think kubelet sometimes is not able to properly identify unmounted volume and clean up its `actualstateofworld` cache. It thinks the volume is not unmounted and keeps on trying unmounting it. This outputs a lot of logs which flood journalctl -> fluentd/bit -> third party logging solution. The flooding causes 2 problems:\r\n1. Consumes node disk which reduces the amount of disk available for pods\r\n2. Increases ingestion rate for paid third party logging solution thereby costing extra money1 and 2 can be worked around by rotating the logs more frequently, dropping the logs or filtering them out from ingestion into the third party logging solution but it is not a permanent fix to the problem. Also, note that re-starting kubelet fixes the issue. Here's what the error log looks like:\r\n```\r\n\"Feb 13 22:05:35 ip-10-57-71-57 kubelet: E0213 22:05:35.753487   28558 reconciler.go:193] \\\"operationExecutor.UnmountVolume failed (controllerAttachDetachEnabled true) for volume \\\\\\\"drupal-code\\\\\\\" (UniqueName: \\\\\\\"kubernetes.io/csi/48033fa8-05f1-4c32-b109-4e25f23107ef-drupal-code\\\\\\\") pod \\\\\\\"48033fa8-05f1-4c32-b109-4e25f23107ef\\\\\\\" (UID: \\\\\\\"48033fa8-05f1-4c32-b109-4e25f23107ef\\\\\\\") : UnmountVolume.NewUnmounter failed for volume \\\\\\\"drupal-code\\\\\\\" (UniqueName: \\\\\\\"kubernetes.io/csi/48033fa8-05f1-4c32-b109-4e25f23107ef-drupal-code\\\\\\\") pod \\\\\\\"48033fa8-05f1-4c32-b109-4e25f23107ef\\\\\\\" (UID: \\\\\\\"48033fa8-05f1-4c32-b109-4e25f23107ef\\\\\\\") : kubernetes.io/csi: unmounter failed to load volume data file [/var/lib/kubelet/pods/48033fa8-05f1-4c32-b109-4e25f23107ef/volumes/kubernetes.io~csi/drupal-code/mount]: kubernetes.io/csi: failed to open volume data file [/var/lib/kubelet/pods/48033fa8-05f1-4c32-b109-4e25f23107ef/volumes/kubernetes.io~csi/drupal-code/vol_data.json]: open /var/lib/kubelet/pods/48033fa8-05f1-4c32-b109-4e25f23107ef/volumes/kubernetes.io~csi/drupal-code/vol_data.json: no such file or directory\\\" err=\\\"UnmountVolume.NewUnmounter failed for volume \\\\\\\"drupal-code\\\\\\\" (UniqueName: \\\\\\\"kubernetes.io/csi/48033fa8-05f1-4c32-b109-4e25f23107ef-drupal-code\\\\\\\") pod \\\\\\\"48033fa8-05f1-4c32-b109-4e25f23107ef\\\\\\\" (UID: \\\\\\\"48033fa8-05f1-4c32-b109-4e25f23107ef\\\\\\\") : kubernetes.io/csi: unmounter failed to load volume data file [/var/lib/kubelet/pods/48033fa8-05f1-4c32-b109-4e25f23107ef/volumes/kubernetes.io~csi/drupal-code/mount]: kubernetes.io/csi: failed to open volume data file [/var/lib/kubelet/pods/48033fa8-05f1-4c32-b109-4e25f23107ef/volumes/kubernetes.io~csi/drupal-code/vol_data.json]: open /var/lib/kubelet/pods/48033fa8-05f1-4c32-b109-4e25f23107ef/volumes/kubernetes.io~csi/drupal-code/vol_data.json: no such file or directory\\\"\r\n```\r\nIf you look at the code for 1.22, you can see the the log is output [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/bc4763cbf8b9e6adfbc07bb3194509b187b0b901/pkg/kubelet/volumemanager/reconciler/reconciler.go#L191).\r\n\r\nCouple of things to note here: \r\n1.

I will take a look if I have time LOL.\n---\n\nUser 'vadasambar' said:\n---\nWe checked some pods with unmount errors and Interestingly we are seeing `Orphaned pod found, but volumes are not cleaned up\" podUID=XXXX` log such pods. This might be due to parent getting removed abruptly. I wonder if the parent controller is removing the pods in a way it shouldn't or if kubelet is not responding well to such deletions. We have seen it happen with Job and ReplicaSets.\n---\n\nUser 'dims' said:\n---\ncc @ConnorJC3 @torredil see references to `ebs.csi.aws.com csidriver` above\n---\n\nUser 'cvvz' said:\n---\nI think these two issues are the same, there is a TOCTOU problem and `vol.data` maybe removed multiple times which trigger this issue.\r\nWe have fixed this issue by skipping `UnmountDevice` when `vol_data.json` file does not exist,  since in this situation, `UnmountDevice` must has been executed successfully before, no need to do `UnmountDevice` multiple times.\n---\n\nUser 'jingxu97' said:\n---\n/cc @jingxu97\n---\n\nUser 'vadasambar' said:\n---\n@cvvz which release is this fixed in?

The reason being that `backoffLimit` on a Job is not something the Pod knows about, so once your Pod has restarted 6 times (default) the job is failed but the Pod doesn't know to stop restarting its containers and would therefore continue on crashlooping forever, the Job controller deletes the pod to prevent it from doing this. \r\n\r\nSpecifically the Job controller deletes any active pods when the Job becomes failed, this is why you don't see pods getting deleted when using `RestartPolicy: Never`, these pods are no longer active so they don't need cleaning up.\r\n\r\nI'd always recommend having a logging pipeline in your cluster so that you have a persistent store of your logs for debugging, pod logs are always temporary.\n---\n\nUser 'fejta-bot' said:\n---\nIssues go stale after 90d of inactivity.\nMark the issue as fresh with `/remove-lifecycle stale`.\nStale issues rot after an additional 30d of inactivity and eventually close.\n\nIf this issue is safe to close now please do so with `/close`.\n\nSend feedback to sig-testing, kubernetes/test-infra and/or [fejta](https://github.com/fejta).\n/lifecycle stale\n---\n\nUser 'fejta-bot' said:\n---\nStale issues rot after 30d of inactivity.\nMark the issue as fresh with `/remove-lifecycle rotten`.\nRotten issues close after an additional 30d of inactivity.\n\nIf this issue is safe to close now please do so with `/close`.\n\nSend feedback to sig-testing, kubernetes/test-infra and/or [fejta](https://github.com/fejta).\n/lifecycle rotten\n---\n\nUser 'fejta-bot' said:\n---\nRotten issues close after 30d of inactivity.\nReopen the issue with `/reopen`.\nMark the issue as fresh with `/remove-lifecycle rotten`.\n\nSend feedback to sig-testing, kubernetes/test-infra and/or [fejta](https://github.com/fejta).\n/close\n---\n\nUser 'k8s-ci-robot' said:\n---\n@fejta-bot: Closing this issue.\n\n<details>\n\nIn response to [this](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/74848#issuecomment-522316916):\n\n>Rotten issues close after 30d of inactivity.\n>Reopen the issue with `/reopen`.\n>Mark the issue as fresh with `/remove-lifecycle rotten`.\n>\n>Send feedback to sig-testing, kubernetes/test-infra and/or [fejta](https://github.com/fejta).\n>/close\n\n\nInstructions for interacting with me using PR comments are available [here](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/guide/pull-requests.md).

My expectation was that when a Pod in a Job has `restartPolicy: OnFailure`, a container that fails is restarted indefinitely, independently of any settings in the Job. However, the restarts of a container seem to count against the `backoffLimit` of the Job. So, the actual behaviour is:\r\n\r\n1. A container in the Pod fails and is restarted\r\n1. The Job Controller registers this and increments the backoff counter (which is measured agains `backoffLimit`)\r\n1. The restarted container fails again\r\n1. The Job Controller increments the backoff counter\r\n1. ...\r\n\r\nAt this point, it's still the same Pod running that the Job initially created. However, when the backoff counter reaches `backoffLimit` the Job Controller actively deletes the Pod and marks the Job as Failed with a reason of `BackoffLimitExceeded`.\r\n\r\nThis is different from the behaviour for a Pod with `restartPolicy: Never`. Here the Job Controller only gets active when the Pod as a whole fails, i.e. when _all_ the containers in the Pod fail (and are not restarted because the restart policy is Never, and thus the [phase](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-phase) of the Pod is Failed). At this point, the Job Controller increments the backoff counter and creates a new Pod (without deleting the old one). If this Pod fails again, the cycle repeats until the backoff counter reaches `backoffLimit`, at which point the Job is also marked as failed with a reason of `BackoffLimitExceeded`.\r\n\r\nIt's actually described in this way in the [docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/#job-termination-and-cleanup):\r\n\r\n> By default, a Job will run uninterrupted unless a Pod fails (`restartPolicy=Never`) or a Container exits in error (`restartPolicy=OnFailure`), at which point the Job defers to the `.spec.backoffLimit` described above.\r\n\r\nSo, the semantics of `backoffLimit` changes based on the restart policy of the Pods: if `restartPolicy: OnFailure`, then container restarts are counted as backoffs, and if `restartPolicy: Never`, then new Pod creations are counted as backoffs.\r\n\r\nIn the case of `restartPolicy: OnFailure`, the Job Controller must delete the Pod when the Job is officially marked as Failed otherwise the failing container in the Pod might restart forever, or might eventually run successfully, even tough the Job has already been recognised as Failed.\r\n\r\nThis is also mentioned in the [docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/#pod-backoff-failure-policy):\r\n\r\n> If your job has restartPolicy = \"OnFailure\", keep in mind that your container running the Job will be terminated once the job backoff limit has been reached. This can make debugging the Job's executable more difficult.\r\n\r\nI guess it should read \"...your _Pod_ running the Job will be terminated...\".\n---\n\nUser 'Jonathan-Landeed' said:\n---\n`restartPolicy: Never` doesn't prevent pod deletion if parallelism > 1. It's supposed to delete active pods once backoff limit is exceeded, but it's deleting the failed pod as well.\n---"}

Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\n**CVSS Rating:**  \n[CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3-1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N) \u2014 **Medium (6.8)**\n\n\nA vulnerability exists in the Kubernetes C# client where the certificate validation logic accepts properly constructed certificates from any Certificate Authority (CA) without properly verifying the trust chain. This flaw allows a malicious actor to present a forged certificate and potentially intercept or manipulate communication with the Kubernetes API server, leading to possible man-in-the-middle attacks and API impersonation.\n\n### Am I vulnerable?\n\nYou are vulnerable if:\n- You use the Kubernetes C# client to connect to a Kubernetes API server over TLS/HTTPS  with custom CA certificates in your kubeconfig file and your connection occurs over an untrusted network.\n\n#### Affected Versions\n- All versions of the Kubernetes C# client prior to the next release <=17.0.13\n\n### How do I mitigate this vulnerability?\n\nThis issue can be mitigated by:\n- Deploy the patch version of the Kubernetes C# client as soon as possible.\n- Moving the CA certificates into the system trust store instead of specifying them in the kubeconfig file. Note: This approach may introduce new risks, as all processes on the system will begin to trust certificates signed by that CA. If you must use an affected version, you can disable custom CA and add the CA to the machine's trusted root.\n\n\n#### Fixed Versions\n\n- Kubernetes C# client >= v17.0.14\n\n### Detection\n\nTo determine if your applications are affected:\n- Review your usage of the Kubernetes C# client and inspect certificate validation logic.\n- Review your kubeconfig files and determine if you use a custom CA certificate (the certificate-authority field in the clusters section).\n- Review client logs for unexpected or untrusted certificate connections.\n\nIf you find evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited, please contact security@kubernetes.io\n\n#### Acknowledgements\n\nThis vulnerability was reported by @elliott-beach\n\nThe issue was fixed and coordinated by: \n\nBoshi Lian @tg123\nBrendan Burns @brendandburns\nRita Zhang @ritazh", "response": "The issue was addressed with the following discussion:\n\nUser 'ritazh' said:\n---\n/area security\n/kind bug\n/committee security-response\n/label official-cve-feed\n/triage accepted\n---\n\nUser 'lmktfy' said:\n---\nIf this has been fixed, is it feasible to close the issue?\n\nOpen issues show as open (implying not-yet-fixed) in the [CVE feed](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/issues-security/official-cve-feed/).\n---"}
{"instruction": "A user reported the following issue titled '[sig-network] Conntrack proxy implementation should not be vulnerable to the invalid conntrack state bug [Privileged] failing due to bug in test' in the 'kubernetes/kubernetes' repository. Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\n### Description\n\n`[sig-network] Conntrack proxy implementation should not be vulnerable to the invalid conntrack state bug [Privileged]` has been historically flaking in downstream OpenShift CI jobs. However, the flakes were very random and couldn't be easily reproduced for debugging.\n\n### Details\n\nAs per the test [details](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/f9a55d78c773fb4fa4a586919d4eff6b4a59c4f9/test/e2e/network/conntrack.go#L544-L668), the test should pass if `nf_conntrack_tcp_be_liberal` is enforced. The test expects that when the server sends an out-of-window TCP packet, it should either be dropped or should be correctly NAT-ed and forwarded to the client. The test fails when the server receives an RST packet from the client which is expected happen when the out-of-window packet is not dropped and also not correctly NAT-ed.\n\nOpenShift uses OVN-Kubernetes CNI and `nf_conntrack_tcp_be_liberal` is always [enforced](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/5aca7966d2a7255ba92fd5e63268dd767b223aa5/net/openvswitch/conntrack.c#L832). Thus, the issue of incorrect NAT should not arise. However, the test still randomly flaked because the server had received an RST packet from the client.\n\nRecently, we took an effort to understand the reason why the test was flaking. For reproducing the issue, the test was run for longer duration of time and packets were captured. The test eventually did fail, however looking at the packet captures it became evident the test failed due to an incorrect logic in the server code, instead of incorrect packet NAT.\n\nPacket capture at the client side:\n```\n9715    2025-09-09 16:58:37.217654    10.129.0.42    172.30.47.170    TCP    74    36955 \u2192 9000 [SYN] Seq=0 Win=62027 Len=0 MSS=8861 SACK_PERM TSval=3989781034 TSecr=0 WS=128\n9716    2025-09-09 16:58:37.217933    172.30.47.170    10.129.0.42    TCP    74    9000 \u2192 36955 [SYN, ACK] Seq=0 Ack=1 Win=61943 Len=0 MSS=8861 SACK_PERM TSval=1962462568 TSecr=3989781034 WS=128\n9717    2025-09-09 16:58:37.217952    10.129.0.42    172.30.47.170    TCP    66    36955 \u2192 9000 [ACK] Seq=1 Ack=1 Win=62080 Len=0 TSval=3989781034 TSecr=1962462568\n9718    2025-09-09 16:58:37.217965    10.129.0.42    172.30.47.170    TCP    66    36955 \u2192 9000 [FIN, ACK] Seq=1 Ack=1 Win=62080 Len=0 TSval=3989781034 TSecr=1962462568\n9719    2025-09-09 16:58:37.218255    172.30.47.170    10.129.0.42    TCP    61    [TCP Spurious Retransmission] 9000 \u2192 36955 [PSH, ACK] Seq=4294867297 Ack=1 Win=62080 Len=7\n9720    2025-09-09 16:58:37.218262    10.129.0.42    172.30.47.170    TCP    78    [TCP Dup ACK 9717#1] 36955 \u2192 9000 [ACK] Seq=2 Ack=1 Win=62080 Len=0 TSval=3989781035 TSecr=1962462568 SLE=4294867297 SRE=4294867304\n9721    2025-09-09 16:58:37.218435    172.30.47.170    10.129.0.42    TCP    66    9000 \u2192 36955 [ACK] Seq=1 Ack=2 Win=61952 Len=0 TSval=1962462569 TSecr=3989781034\n9802    2025-09-09 16:58:47.218027    10.129.0.42    172.30.47.170    TCP    74    38949 \u2192 9000 [SYN] Seq=0 Win=62027 Len=0 MSS=886\n...

{"instruction": "A user reported the following issue titled 'Pod Informer Update with updated Pod UID can lead to attachdetach controller desired_state_of_world cache inaccuracy' in the 'kubernetes/kubernetes' repository. Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\n### What happened?\n\nVolume force detached due to incorrect attachdetach controller desired_state_of_world \r\n\r\nThe attach-detach controller reconciles between two caches, actual_state_of_world and desired_state_of_world [Design](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/20262). The desired state of the world is updated by a [pod informer](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/controller/volume/attachdetach/attach_detach_controller.go#L196).\r\n\r\nAs discovered in #83810, a pod delete and create event with the same pod name can be delivered as an update event by the pod informer. The attachdetach controller treats pod add/update events the same, but only updates the desired_state_of_world if a [pod does not exist](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/controller/volume/attachdetach/cache/desired_state_of_world.go#L257). This means that if the event is an add/delete event (delivered as an update event with a updated pod UID), the desired_state_of_world will not be updated with the latest UID. If this happens, the state of the desired_state_of_world is inaccurate, as the pod UID is stale.\r\n\r\nPeriodically, the desired_state_of_world_populator reconciles all pods in its cache. If it detects a pod UID mismatch with the current pod UID in the informer, the pod is [removed from desired_state_of_world](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/controller/volume/attachdetach/populator/desired_state_of_world_populator.go#L154). Once removed, the pod can be force detached by the reconciler, if it has not existed in the desired_state_of_world for [the timeout period, 6 minutes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/86571236e32f5e5b94c4336407878beb7d41a87a/pkg/controller/volume/attachdetach/reconciler/reconciler.go#L265). Note that prior to #110721, this was done for all nodes, not just unhealthy nodes.\r\n\r\nThe attachdetach controller has a safeguard to reconcile this type of inaccuracy. In desired_state_of_world_populator, there are two loops\r\n1. The [findAndRemoveDeletedPods()](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.22/pkg/controller/volume/attachdetach/populator/desired_state_of_world_populator.go#L115) loop. This runs at a period of every 1 minute\r\n2. The [findAndAddActivePods()](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.22/pkg/controller/volume/attachdetach/populator/desired_state_of_world_populator.go#L175) loop. This runs at a period of every 3 minutes.\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, if findAndRemoveDeletedPods() removes a pod, and findAndAddActivePods() runs directly after, desired_state_of_world only stays in an inaccurate state for a brief period of time. However, if the desired_state_of_world_populator loop has some latency in processing (eg: large number of pods, CPU throttling), it's possible for more than 6 minutes to pass between when the pod is removed from desired_state_of_world and when the pod is added back in the findAndAddActivePods() loop.\n\n### What did you\n...

Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\nCVSS Rating: ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)) (Score: 9.8, Critical)\n\nA security issue was discovered in Kubernetes where under certain conditions, an unauthenticated attacker with access to the pod network can achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of the ingress-nginx controller. This can lead to disclosure of Secrets accessible to the controller. (Note that in the default installation, the controller can access all Secrets cluster-wide.)\n\n### Am I vulnerable?\n\nThis issue affects ingress-nginx. If you do not have ingress-nginx installed on your cluster, you are not affected. You can check this by running \\`kubectl get pods \\--all-namespaces \\--selector app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx\\`.\n\n#### Affected Versions\n\n- < v1.11.0\n- v1.11.0 \\- 1.11.4  \n- v1.12.0\n\n### How do I mitigate this vulnerability?\n\n**ACTION REQUIRED:** The following steps must be taken to mitigate this vulnerability: Upgrade ingress-nginx to v1.11.5, v1.12.1, or any later version.\n\nBefore applying the patch, this issue can be mitigated by disabling the Validating Admission Controller functionality of ingress-nginx.\n\n#### Fixed Versions\n\n- ingress-nginx [main@0ccf4ca](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/13068/commits/0ccf4caaadec919680c455d221e53d97970d527d)\n\nTo upgrade, refer to the documentation: [Upgrading Ingress-nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/upgrade/)\n\n### Detection\n\nThere are no known indicators of compromise that prove this vulnerability has been exploited.\n\nIf you find evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited, please contact security@kubernetes.io\n\n#### Acknowledgements\n\nThis vulnerability was reported by Nir Ohfeld, Ronen Shustin, Sagi Tzadik, and Hillai Ben Sasson from Wiz\n\nThe issue was fixed and coordinated by Marco Ebert, James Strong, Tabitha Sable, and the Kubernetes Security Response Committee", "response": "The issue was addressed with the following discussion:\n\nUser 'tabbysable' said:\n---\n/triage accepted\n---\n\nUser 'thisisharrsh' said:\n---\nHi @tabbysable, Please add the issue description for better understanding of the issue.\n/triage needs-information\n---\n\nUser 'tabbysable' said:\n---\n/area security\n/kind bug\n/committee security-response\n/label official-cve-feed\n/sig network\n---\n\nUser 'tabbysable' said:\n---\n/assign @tabbysable\n---\n\nUser 'tabbysable' said:\n---\nRecord is now live in CVE database: https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-1974\n---\n\nUser 'tabbysable' said:\n---\nBuilds have completed: [v1.11.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/13074) and [v1.12.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/13073) are now available!\n---\n\nUser 'whereisaaron' said:\n---\nHi, thank you for these quick releases!

The admission webhook's ClusterIP is only accessible within the cluster\n2. Private subnets prevent direct internet access to the nodes\n3. Access would require compromising another workload within the cluster first\n\nHowever, I'd appreciate clarification on:\n- Is this a sufficient security boundary?\n- Are there any edge cases where the admission controller could still be exposed?\n- Should we still upgrade despite these network controls?\n\nEDIT - Created a new issue to get some traction #131062\n---\n\nUser 'arianitu' said:\n---\nCan we please get a k8s network policy that prevents this exploit ASAP? For people who have network policies enabled, it seems like the easiest mitigation mechanism (requiring no changes such as deleting the webhook) would be disabling traffic to it. \n\nI'm looking into it, but I am unsure what needs access to ingress-nginx-controller-admission.ingress-nginx.svc.cluster.local for example.\n---\n\nUser 'arianitu' said:\n---\nEDIT:\n\nI've deleted this network policy because it will not work, still looking to find one that would mitigate this without requiring deletion of anything\n\nEDIT2:\n\nI gave up on a network policy mechanism as it was complex and instead followed the mitigation of deleting the `validating-webhook` lines from the deployment and removing the ingress-nginx-admission ValidatingWebhookConfiguration\n\nI am unsure if there's a good network policy that still allows the control pane to access the webhook but no other namespaces as you would need to restrict the port with cidr ranges (I believe) and that gets tricky. If your control pane ranges are static I think its possible to keep functionality the same and still mitigate but I wasn't able to find a good way to get control pane CIDR ranges for managed k8s on public clouds. \n\nI still feel like a network policy that mitigates this would be fantastic instead of having to delete the functionality entirely for people who cannot upgrade right away.\n---\n\nUser 'mariocandela' said:\n---\nGuys, if I can help you in any way, drop me a message!\n---\n\nUser 'thenam153' said:\n---\nI'm researching ways to mitigate the attack surface of this CVE, and I currently have a question regarding the attack payload injection via the ingress controller. \n\nSpecifically, if we prevent reading file descriptors (like `/proc/xx/fd/xxx`) within the container using the `www-data` user, would this effectively reduce the attack surface associated with this vulnerability? \n\nOr are there alternative methods to inject payloads without relying on file descriptor access?\n---\n\nUser 'stefanlasiewski' said:\n---\n> this issue can be mitigated by disabling the Validating Admission Controller functionality of ingress-nginx.\n\nWouldn't this expose us to other, past CVEs? My understanding is that the validating admission controller will validate (Sanitize) a number of fields and thus prevent users from adding unsanitized or malicious text into those fields, and blocks a number of exploits & CVEs from before IngressNightmare. \n\nDoes disabling the Validating Admission Control allow unsanitized input?\n---\n\nUser 'Kingshuk-Kubera' said:\n---\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/releases\n\n**In above link, change log of \"controller-v1.12.1\" says -**\n\n\"This release fixes the following CVEs:\n\nCVE-2025-1097\nCVE-2025-1098\nCVE-2025-1974\nCVE-2025-24513\nCVE-2025-24514\n\"\n**Just below that, it also says -**\n\"Unfortunately, to fix  CVE-2025-1974 it was necessary to disable the validation of the generated NGINX configuration during the validation of Ingress resources.\"\n\nDoes that imply, upgrading to v1.12.1 is not enough, I have to also additionally disable \"Validating Admission Controller\" by doing any of the following  -\nIf you have installed ingress-nginx using Helm - Reinstall, setting the Helm value controller.admissionWebhooks.enabled=false\n\nIf you have installed ingress-nginx manually -\ndelete the ValidatingWebhookconfiguration called ingress-nginx-admission\nedit the ingress-nginx-controller Deployment or Daemonset, removing --validating-webhook from the controller container\u2019s argument list\n\nPlease advise.\n---\n\nUser 'johanot' said:\n---\n@Kingshuk-Kubera I read it as: The admission controller is now less smart. Generated nginx config used to be verified _both_ by the admission controller and by nginx itself at reload. Now, to prevent CVE-2025-1974, only the latter happens.\n\nIt means that you are safe, and enabling the admission-controller is safe, but the fix comes with the cost of a slightly higher risk of nginx failing at runtime (at config reload) due to invalid config.\n---\n\nUser 'Kingshuk-Kubera' said:\n---\n@johanot : One more clarification, change log also says - \n\"The resulting NGINX configuration is still checked before the actual loading, so that there are no failures of the underlying NGINX. However, invalid Ingress resources can lead to the NGINX configuration no longer being able to be updated.\"\n\n**What is the meaning of \"However, invalid Ingress resources can lead to the NGINX configuration no longer being able to be updated.\"?**\n---\n\nUser 'theCapypara' said:\n---\nAs far as I understand:\nThis means that any invalid ingress resource could stop any further changes to the Nginx configuration from actually being applied.\nThis would mean that your ingress would stop \"reacting\" to any changes in any ingress resource until the resource that is \"blocking\" the update from working is fixed.\nThis is basically the same behaviour that existed before the admission webhook was introduced.\n---\n\nUser 'TomyLobo' said:\n---\n> CVSS Rating: ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)) (Score: 9.8, Critical)\n\nvs.\n\n> an unauthenticated attacker with access to the pod network\n\nThe pod network isn't routed.\nDoesn't that make it AV:A, not AV:N?\n**That would lower the score from 9.8 to 8.8 (High).**\n\nFor reference, here are the definitions:\n<details>\n<summary>Attack Vector: Network (AV:N):</summary>\nThe vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Attack Vector: Adjacent (AV:A):</summary>\nThe vulnerable component is bound to the network stack, but the attack is limited at the protocol level to a logically adjacent topology. This can mean an attack must be launched from the same shared physical (e.g., Bluetooth or IEEE 802.11) or logical (e.g., local IP subnet) network, or from within a secure or otherwise limited administrative domain (e.g., MPLS, secure VPN to an administrative network zone).\n</details>\n---\n\nUser 'johanot' said:\n---\n@TomyLobo \n\n> The pod network isn't routed.\n\nIt is not directly routable in most of my installations, but in _some_ setups it is. I have customers with DHCP CNI and corp-wide routable service-nets and pod-nets.\n\nSpeaking of the service-net (cluster-ips).. This also gives access to the admission-controller.\n\nAlso; in other setups, these nets might not be routable, but the cluster itself is multi-tenancy, so workload in user-namespaces might be less trustworthy. Remember, any pod in _any_ namespace has access to the pod net.\n\nThat said; I don't have any opinions on whether the above arguments make it `AV:N` or not.\n---\n\nUser 'ErikEngerd' said:\n---\nLooks like there is only a vulnerability from external (outside pod network) when the validating admission controller is exposed publically (which it usually isn't). Also from inside the pod network, when restricting network traffic using network policies to allow only the required traffic by pods, the attack is also impossible it seems.\n---\n\nUser 'Mr-P-D' said:\n---\nBased on the official comments from the Kubernetes Blog, PODs can only be accessed by the people/user in the same VPC/corporate network. \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13893b89-ea00-4acb-b428-f29ec2c21334)\n\nHence, i think the Attack Vector parameter in CVSS Score should be **Adjacent (A)** and not Network, as this vulnerability is not remotely exploitable. External attacker cannot directly interact with PODs, making it impossible to exploit remotely.\n\nReference - https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/03/24/ingress-nginx-cve-2025-1974/\n---\n\nUser 'tuminoid' said:\n---\n> Hence, i think the Attack Vector parameter in CVSS Score should be **Adjacent (A)** and not Network, as this vulnerability is not remotely exploitable.

However, when we switched to 1.11.5, the issue was resolved. Do you know anything about this?\n\nEdit: I found the problem here:\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/12655\n---\n\nUser 'ntavares' said:\n---\nThanks @suhettfilipe indeed, version 1.12.1 seems to not be doing what this CVE or documentation is stating,  it seems to discard ingresses with configuration/server -snippets, regardless of [allow-snippet-annotations: true](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/configmap/#allow-snippet-annotations) (~~didn't check if annotations-risk-level: Critical will help~~ I decided to check this, from what I can see we need to use the configurations allow-snippet-annotations=true together with annotations-risk-level=Critical).\n\nThis is particularly confusing because if the error is introduced after controller is deployed, the ingress' nginx configuration is not refreshed, but intead the previous version will keep running. So everything seems fine, until one day the pod restarts, and you're presented with a missing ingress...\n---"}

Kubernetes restart on Windows doesn't help, need to delete all stuff and re-join node to cluster again.\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\n HNS Endpoint would be updated with new IP address after CoreDNS pod restart\n\n### How can we reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?\n\n\n1.    Deploy a cluster with 3 Linux master nodes.\n2.    Join 1 Windows worker node.\n3.    Start sample workload on Windows node (used mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/samples:aspnetapp)\n4.    Exec into Windows pod with cmd, type nslookup, observe working output\n```\nDefault Server:  kube-dns.kube-system.svc.cluster.local\nAddress:  10.43.0.10\n```\n5.    Exit Windows pod, get pods list from kube-system namespace with -o wide, note CoreDNS pod ip.\n6.    Delete CoreDNS pod, wait for new to start, check its IP address.\n7.

It's indeed a bug in my implementation.  The warning is printed whenever `SessionAffinity` is not an empty string or not provided in resource data - https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/43706d6b7a89cde01089a360a0e6547691308cf8/pkg/api/service/warnings.go#L51\n\nHowever, I've just realized that this field has a default value that is used every time the `SessionAffinity` is not specified -  https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/845e94d37075d199cd3cc23ac05f05a95e2c15b8/pkg/apis/core/v1/defaults.go#L107-L109\n\nThis means that we'll print this warning whenever a headless service is created or updated, which is wrong. \nI'll prepare a fix for that that will print this error only when sessionAffinity is `ClientIP`\n---\n\nUser 'rxinui' said:\n---\n@Peac36 I was preparing a quick fix locally but better have it from the original commiter \ud83d\udc4d \n\nI reckon this falls under sig-apps @soltysh\n---\n\nUser 'Peac36' said:\n---\n/assign\n---\n\nUser 'soltysh' said:\n---\n> I reckon this falls under sig-apps [@soltysh](https://github.com/soltysh)\n\nServices fall under sig-network, so marking accordingly.\n/sig network\n---"}

{"instruction": "A user reported the following issue titled 'Status().Update() returns \"not found\" for existing custom resource with matching resource version' in the 'kubernetes/kubernetes' repository. Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\n### What happened?\n\nWhen updating the status subresource of a custom resource using client.Status().Update(), the operation fails with a \"not found\" error even though:\n\n1. The custom resource definitively exists in the cluster\n2. The resource versions match exactly between our object and the cluster state\n3. The status subresource is properly configured with +kubebuilder:subresource:status\n4. Regular (non-status) updates to the same resource work correctly\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nThe status update should succeed when the resource exists and resource versions match.\n\n### How can we reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?\n\nThis occurs intermittently in a controller-runtime based operator during status updates after successful reconciliation. The issue appears to be a race condition between the main resource and its status subresource.\n\nDetailed evidence from logs:\n```\nlevel=info msg=\"attempting status update\" \n  resource_version=774328992 phase=Ready\n\nlevel=info msg=\"CR exists, checking resource versions\" \n  current_rv=774328992 updating_rv=774328992 rv_matches=true\n\nlevel=error msg=\"status update failed\" \n  error=\"orchestrators.sms-operator.alluvial.finance \\\"sms-0-orch-0\\\" not found\"\n\nlevel=error msg=\"CR STILL EXISTS after 'not found' status update error\" \n  confirm_rv=774328992 confirm_uid=2f2618e7-fafa-4683-aaa7-553741d52a05\n```\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1. Pre-update verification: client.Get() confirms resource exists with RV 774328992\n2. Resource version sync: Our object has identical resource version 774328992\n3. Status update fails: Returns \"not found\" despite matching resource versions\n4. Post-error confirmation: client.Get() immediately after failure confirms resource still exists with same RV and UID\n\nThis suggests an internal inconsistency in the API server between the main resource and status subresource endpoints.\n\n**Environment**\n\n- Kubernetes version: \n- Kubernetes cluster version: v1.32.8-eks-e386d34 (Amazon EKS)\n- controller-runtime version: v0.22.1\n- Kubernetes API client libraries: v0.34.1\n- kubectl version: v1.32.2\n- Custom Resource: Uses status subresource with proper _+kubebuilder:subresource:status_ marker\n- Frequency: Intermittent but reproducible under normal controller operation\n\n**Impact**\n\n- Controllers must implement complex retry mechanisms for status updates\n- Status-dependent functionality becomes unreliable\n- Workarounds require using annotations instead of the proper status subresource\n\n**Workaround**\n\n- Currently using annotations instead of status subresource to track critical state, which bypasses this issue but defeats the purpose of the status subresource design.\n- Additional context\n- This appears to be a race condition or consistency issue specifically with status subresources. The main resource CRUD operations work reliably, but the status subresource exhibits this phantom \"not found\" behavior despite the resource being continuously accessible via the main endpoint.\n\n### Anything else we n\n...

Delete a StatefulSet using the `orphan` propagation policy.\n2.

The StatefulSet is marked for deletion and gets an orphan finalizer.\n2. The garbage collector starts asynchronously removing the Pod\u2019s ownerReferences.\n3. The Pod doesn't get any protective finalizers.\n4. A new StatefulSet is created, but it hasn\u2019t become the owner of the Pod yet.\n5. During this window, the garbage collector may see that the Pod has neither an owner nor a finalizer.\n6. As a result, the garbage collector thinks the Pod can be deleted.\n\n```\nfunc (gc *GarbageCollector) attemptToDeleteItem(ctx context.Context, item *node) error {\n    solid, dangling, waitingForDependentsDeletion, err := gc.classifyReferences(ctx, item, ownerReferences)\n    \n    switch {\n    case len(solid) != 0:\n        return nil\n    default:\n        // Key point: If there are no valid owner references\n        // At this point, the object's own finalizers will be checked to determine the deletion policy\n        switch {\n        case hasOrphanFinalizer(latest):\n            policy = metav1.DeletePropagationOrphan\n        case hasDeleteDependentsFinalizer(latest):\n            policy = metav1.DeletePropagationForeground\n        default:\n            // 1.

{"instruction": "A user reported the following issue titled 'One pv with NFS can be mounted by two pods even with ReadWriteOncePod enabled' in the 'kubernetes/kubernetes' repository. Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\n### What happened?\r\n\r\nCloud provider: openstack\r\nCsi driver: NFS(Manila)\r\n\r\n- First, I got one replicaSet with 1 replica and RWOP enabled so pod A comes up in node A. \r\n- Then, edit the nodeSelector to node B and forcibly delete the pod A which results in the pod A in terminate state and pod B is running in node B. \r\n- During this short period, pod A and pod B can both write data to the same pv even with RWOP enabled.\r\n- After pod A is eliminated, pod B fully controls the volume.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nThe pv should always read-write by a single pod but not access by two pods when the old one is in grace period.\r\n\r\n### How can we reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?\r\n\r\n1. Apply a replicaSet with 1 replica and RWOP enabled like:\r\n```\r\napiVersion: apps/v1\r\nkind: ReplicaSet\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: test\r\nspec:\r\n  replicas: 1\r\n  selector:\r\n    matchLabels:\r\n      app: test\r\n  template:\r\n    metadata:\r\n      labels:\r\n        app: test\r\n    spec:\r\n      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 120\r\n      containers:\r\n      - name: writer\r\n        image: busybox\r\n        env:\r\n        - name: MY_POD_NAME\r\n          valueFrom:\r\n            fieldRef:\r\n              fieldPath: metadata.name\r\n        volumeMounts:\r\n        - name: my-volume\r\n          mountPath: \"/mnt\"\r\n        command: [\"/bin/sh\"]\r\n        args:\r\n        - -c\r\n        - |\r\n          while true; do\r\n            echo $MY_POD_NAME $(date) >> /mnt/myfile.txt;\r\n            sleep 1;\r\n          done\r\n      volumes:\r\n      - name: my-volume\r\n        persistentVolumeClaim:\r\n          claimName: pvc-rwop\r\n     nodeSelector:\r\n       xxx\r\n```\r\n3. After pod is running, change the nodeSelector in replicaSet to another node\r\n4. Forcibly delete the pod with `kubectl delete pod test-5nffh --force `\r\n5. A new node `test-g6vnt `should come up in a different node and the old pod should be terminated\r\n6. At this time, pv is writable for these two pods and the file /mnt/myfile.txt is overlapped like this:\r\n```\r\n# cat /mnt/myfile.txt\r\ntest-5nffh Tue Apr 9 07:29:03 UTC 2024\r\ntest-5nffh Tue Apr 9 07:29:04 UTC 2024\r\ntest-5nffh Tue Apr 9 07:29:05 UTC 2024\r\ntest-g6vnt Tue Apr 9 07:29:06 UTC 2024\r\ntest-5nffh Tue Apr 9 07:29:06 UTC 2024\r\ntest-g6vnt Tue Apr 9 07:29:07 UTC 2024\r\ntest-5nffh Tue Apr 9 07:29:07 UTC 2024\r\ntest-g6vnt Tue Apr 9 07:29:08 UTC 2024\r\ntest-5nffh Tue Apr 9 07:29:08 UTC 2024\r\n```\r\n7.

I'll do it later. But let's put manila aside and I'm wondering if it's designed as such when it comes to NFS? I'm asking because NFS has no concept of an attach that means if a pod is being force deletion, a new pod can read-write the same pv because attachdetach-controller is unable to detect it even with ReadWriteOncePod enabled.\n---\n\nUser 'xing-yang' said:\n---\n@DonghaopengZhu K8s has no way to detect this if the pod is forced deleted. For this feature to work, the pod has to be graceful terminated.  We should probably document this more clearly.

Forcibly delete the pod with kubectl delete pod test-5nffh --force \r\n\r\nForce delete has consequences. For example, it will break StatefulSet guarantees that only one replica of a Pod ever runs. StatfulSet controller will immediately start a new replica, while the deleted one is still running somewhere.

{"instruction": "A user reported the following issue titled 'Race condition in PV controller storeObjectUpdate()' in the 'kubernetes/kubernetes' repository. Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\n### What happened?\r\n\r\nPV controller (in KCM) has its own cache in addition to the informer cache, to store updates from itself. However, we've identified 2 possible race condition when invoking `storeObjectUpdate()` from multiple goroutines.\r\n\r\n`storeObjectUpdate()` is currently invoked from `setClaimProvisioner()` and `syncUnboundClaim()`, which runs in 2 different goroutine. And I would expect more concurrent access for enhanced throughput in the future.\r\n\r\nRace conditions:\r\n1. internal update overwrites external delete. When a object is deleted from APIServer, an update request from controller itself may still in-flight. After the update returns, it tries to insert the object back to the cache, overwriting deletion propagated from informer. Resulting in the object staying in cache forever. Subsequently causing, for example, PV stay in Bound state forever and cannot be released.\r\n2. read-compare-write in `storeObjectUpdate()`. When invoked concurrently, an old version (defined by ResourceVersion) may overwrite new version. Resulting in 15s cache stall (should be fixed by next sync).\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nNo race conditions. Internal cache stays consistent on concurrent access.\r\n\r\n### How can we reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?\r\n\r\nHard to reproduce, this only happens with a small chance.\r\n\r\nWe observed condition 1 when we try to optimize the throughput of PV controller.\r\n\r\n### Anything else we need to know?\r\n\r\nTo fix race condition 2, I propose: add locks around `storeObjectUpdate()`\r\n\r\nTo fix race condition 1, I propose: explicitly differentiate update and add event, do not allow add for internal update response.\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes version\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ kubectl version\r\n# paste output here\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Cloud provider\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n### OS version\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n```console\r\n# On Linux:\r\n$ cat /etc/os-release\r\n# paste output here\r\n$ uname -a\r\n# paste output here\r\n\r\n# On Windows:\r\nC:\\> wmic os get Caption, Version, BuildNumber, OSArchitecture\r\n# paste output here\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Install tools\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Container runtime (CRI) and version (if applicable)\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Related plugins (CNI, CSI, ...) and versions (if applicable)\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n</details>", "response": "The issue was addressed with the following discussion:\n\nUser 'huww98' said:\n---\n/sig storage\n---\n\nUser 'huww98' said:\n---\n/cc @jsafrane \r\nrelated #25881\n---\n\nUser 'xing-yang' said:\n---\n/triage accepted\n---\n\nUser 'jsafrane' said:\n---\n>  1. internal update overwrites external delete.

I think it's mostly theoretical.\r\n\r\nI could imagine something like a new parameter `storeObjectUpdate(..., store cache.Store, obj interface{}, force bool)` that would store the object when it's missing in the cache only when `force == true`. This would be used only in the initial sync or as reaction to informer event. Otherwise, if the object is missing (i.e. must have been deleted from the informer), then it's not added back to the cache. This is of course just an ugly hack on top of the cache.

I think it's mostly theoretical.\r\n\r\nYes. I've seen this in our production cluster, which has some patches to increase the throughput of PV controller. We saw a PV stay in Bound for no reason. And after we created and deleted the referenced PVC once again, the PV was successfully released. We have seen this at least twice.\r\n \r\n> I could imagine something like a new parameter `storeObjectUpdate(..., store cache.Store, obj interface{}, force bool)` that would store the object when it's missing in the cache only when `force == true`.

Then change `storeObjectUpdate()` to only support update.\r\n\r\nI've experimented with another approach. Take the informer cache as the truth, and suppress the stall events. Use a `sync.Map` to maintain the latest generation of each UID, then ignore the update event of stall object, or do not consider stall objects when syncing. At least we cannot mistake deleted object as existing in this approach. But I need to check the generation when reading the cache. We can use `CompareAndSwap` to update the generation map, which seems to be more lightweight and elegant. We can also make good use of informer indexer in this approach.\r\n\r\n> This should get fixed by a periodic sync every 15 seconds.

But I think we can make it work. Or we can still use resource version, the principle should not change.\n---\n\nUser 'jsafrane' said:\n---\n`generation` usually changes when `.spec` changes, not `.status`. And PV controller saves `pv.spec`, `pvc.spec`, `pv.status` and `pvc.status` in one go and it would be great if we could ignore the `.status` updates too.

Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\n/kind bug\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\n\r\nA Deployment spec with hardcoded `replicas` parameter was applied:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\r\nkind: Deployment\r\nmetadata:\r\n  labels:\r\n    name: critical-service\r\n  name: critical-service\r\nspec:\r\n  replicas: 100\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nLater, we've decided to let the `replicas` value be dynamic to be able to manage it with `kubectl scale`, without changing YAML every time. So we applied another spec, without the `replicas` key:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/deployment.yml b/deployment.yml\r\nindex 339531d..f5a3e5f 100644\r\n--- a/deployment.yml\r\n+++ b/deployment.yml\r\n@@ -5,5 +5,4 @@ metadata:\r\n     name: critical-service\r\n   name: critical-service\r\n spec:\r\n-  replicas: 100\r\n   ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the updated spec was applied, Kubernetes ignored existing `replicas` count and scaled the RS down to 1 replica. This was a very unexpected behaviour to scale down an existing deployment.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\nWe expected that skipping `replicas` line in YAML would **preserve** existing replicas count, but in fact it reset all of them to default value which is `1` replicas. This effectively scaled lack of capacity and a severe service distruption to a service that had > 1000 replicas.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:\r\n\r\n1. Create a deployment from a YAML file with hardcoded `replicas` count, with the value above `1`\r\n2. Remove `replicas` line from the YAML and apply the file\r\n3. See ReplicaSet being scaled down to `1` replicas, instead of preserving existing value above `1`\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\n**For us this feels that scaling down by default is an extremely dangerous behaviour.** It makes sense to use the default of 1 replica for new resources, but not for existing resources that have thousands of replicas running.\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes version: v1.10.5-gke.3\r\n- Cloud provider or hardware configuration: GKE", "response": "The issue was addressed with the following discussion:\n\nUser 'k8s-ci-robot' said:\n---\n@kirs: There are no sig labels on this issue.

It makes sense to use the default of 1 replica for new resources, but Kubernetes should not scale down existing resources that have thousands of replicas live.\r\n\r\nI'll be looking forward to make a change for ReplicaSet controller to make this behaviour slightly safer and a bit less unexpected. Let me know what you think!\n---\n\nUser 'ravihugo' said:\n---\nJust got hit by this too. Our CI environment does not currently set the replica value because we would rather manage this separately. So now it looks like we'll need to start managing this in the CI environment. Also the suggested work-around seems a bit strange. Is that equivalent of the first apply setting the replica size to 1 and then re-apply it back to 100 (for example).\r\n\r\nWouldn't that massively affect what the rolling update would look like?\r\n\r\nIn case anyone needs our fix it basically looks like this:\r\n```\r\nREPLICA_COUNT=$(kubectl -n $ENV get deployment ${DEPLOYMENT_NAME} -o=jsonpath='{$.spec.replicas}')\r\n# Runs sed to replace CI_COMMIT_SHA located anywhere in the template file. Passes output of sed directly to kubectl's deploy\r\nsed -e \"s/\\$CI_COMMIT_SHA/$CI_COMMIT_SHA/\" -e \"s/\\#REPLICA_COUNT/replicas: ${REPLICA_COUNT:-1}/\" kube-deploy.template.yaml | kubectl -n $ENV apply -f -\r\n```\r\nAnd our template kube-deploy.template.yaml has #REPLICA_COUNT in the proper place:\r\n```\r\napiVersion: apps/v1beta2\r\nkind: Deployment\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: taco-service\r\nspec:\r\n  #REPLICA_COUNT\r\n  selector:\r\n    matchLabels:\r\n```\r\nThe reason I chose to put this in as #REPLICA_COUNT was basically to avoid error reports from VSCode since my Yaml files get red-underlines if I try to get too fancy.\r\n\r\nOh - forgot to mention, the primary reason we opted to not use kubectl rolling-update and use kubectl apply is because rolling-update primary can affect like 1 attribute, and the primary use-case is just the image name. We like the ability to control mounts, RAM, variables, etc.. with each git push. This makes our CI environment easier when we do have to make such changes.\n---\n\nUser 'chrissound' said:\n---\nThis seems to be in  contradiction to what `kubectl apply` is documented as.  It (replica count) also does not show up as a change when using `kubectl diff -f`...\n---\n\nUser 'rwenz3l' said:\n---\nStumbled upon this today and I also find it difficult to handle. I've started to deploy services with 2, 8 and 20 replicas in certain places and just resetting them to 1 when removing the line seems dangerous to me as well. I always check with `kubectl diff -f ...` before `apply`ing.. but changing with the `kubectl apply set-last-applied` is annoying as well. I'd love to get a different behavior/flag/whatever. Maybe at least a small snippet for batch-editing the deployments.\n---\n\nUser 'collimarco' said:\n---\nI also find [this behavior](https://technologyconversations.com/2018/10/10/to-replicas-or-not-to-replicas-in-kubernetes-deployments-and-statefulsets/) extremely confusing and against the declarative approach of Kubernetes.\r\n\r\n**Maybe a solution would be to have a `replicas: auto` instead of leaving out the key/value pair?** In this way K8s knows that we want to change that option and not keep the key/value pair of a previous `apply`.\n---\n\nUser 'ayk33' said:\n---\nIs there a reason this issue was closed? This behavior seems very troubling.. Running a deployment with 300+ pods and losing them instantly can cause some serious issues.\n---\n\nUser 'EronWright' said:\n---\nHere's some documentation on how to handle this situation where you want to safely transfer ownership of the replicas field to an autoscaler:\r\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/#transferring-ownership\r\n\r\nTo recap why the replicas was being reset to one, it is because you took ownership of the field in the first step, and when you cleared it, nobody was left as the owner and so the default value was applied.  You were \"unsetting\" the value.\r\nIn CSA mode, the \"last-applied-configuration\" annotation tracks ownership, and that's why one must edit it to relinquish ownership as mentioned [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67135#issuecomment-411429723).\r\nIn SSA mode, ownership is tracked on the server via `.metadata.managedFields`, and must be transferred to another owner as described in the above link. Either way, ownership must be relinquished beforehand.\n---\n\nUser 'Zeouterlimits' said:\n---\n> I also find [this behavior](https://technologyconversations.com/2018/10/10/to-replicas-or-not-to-replicas-in-kubernetes-deployments-and-statefulsets/) extremely confusing and against the declarative approach of Kubernetes.\n\nMaybe a solution would be to have a replicas: auto instead of leaving out the key/value pair? In this way K8s knows that we want to change that option and not keep the key/value pair of a previous apply.\n\nThis is a great idea by @collimarco\n---\n\nUser 'younsl' said:\n---\nI'd like to share a recent production incident that demonstrates the severity of this issue in real-world scenarios.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Production Incident Report - Dangerous Replica Reset Behavior</summary>\n\n## Background\n\ninitially encountered pod count yo-yo effects described in [issue #25238](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/25238), where deployment updates with HPA caused replicas to jump unexpectedly (e.g., from 3 to 9, then scale down to 6, then back to HPA target). To resolve this replicas flapping behavior, we decided to [remove spec.replicas from our Deployment manifests](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/best_practices/#leaving-room-for-imperativeness) when HPA is enabled.\n\nHowever, this solution led us directly into the dangerous behavior described in this issue - we avoided one problem only to encounter a much more severe single replica reset issue.\n\n## Incident Timeline:\n\n1. Initial State: Production deployment was running with spec.replicas: 10\n2. Configuration Change: Applied conditional logic to remove spec.replicas when HPA is enabled in deployment template\n\n```yaml\n# my-app/templates/deployment.yaml\nspec:\n  # Do not include replicas in the manifests if you want replicas to be controlled by HPA\n  {{- if not .Values.autoscaling.enabled }}\n  replicas: {{ .Values.replicaCount }}\n  {{- end }}\n```\n\n3. Manual Sync: Both HPA and Deployment resources were managed within a single ArgoCD Application. Manually triggered sync in ArgoCD UI to apply the changes.\n4. Critical Issue: spec.replicas was reset from 10 to 1 (default value)\n5. Service Disruption: 9 of 10 pods were immediately terminated, leaving only 1 pod running\n6. Recovery: HPA eventually scaled back from 1 to 10 pods, but significant downtime occurred\n\n</details>\n\nWhat would be the best approach to prevent this dangerous behavior? This unexpected behavior is very horrible in production workloads. Can't imagine if this had been a mission-critical production workload running 100 replicas.\n---\n\nUser 'alexgo84' said:\n---\nSince this surprising behavior is still taking place, I'm resorting to use heuristics for setting the replicas explicitly, even when HPA is enabled.\nA solution, or at least the reopening this issue, would be most welcome!\n---"}

Under the earlier rules, we only needed to grant permissions for `nodes/status` or `pods/status` to enable these operations, which effectively narrowed the scope of sensitive permissions and minimized their spread.\n\nHowever, if metadata modifications for core resources like Pods and Nodes are also restricted (following the later rule applied to custom resources), it will become inevitable to expand the permission scopes, undermining the goal of limiting the diffusion of sensitive permissions.\n---\n\nUser 'liggitt' said:\n---\nThere are no plans to modify the behavior of older resources like pods and nodes here\n---"}
{"instruction": "A user reported the following issue titled 'bug: kubelet panic & crash if `--config-dir` is used' in the 'kubernetes/kubernetes' repository. Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\n### What happened?\r\n\r\nI created a v1.30.0 k8s cluster with kubeadm and created a  drop-in directory for kubelet configuration under `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf.d`. The normal conf file created by kubeadm is in ` /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml`\r\n\r\nAccording to the [docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubelet-config-file/#kubelet-conf-d) the kubelet should merge all configs in specified order and start. But the kubelet crashes under two setups:\r\n\r\n**Setup 1**:\r\n\r\nThe `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf.d/20-kubelet.conf` is completely empty the kubelet crashes with:\r\n```\r\n>kubelet --config-dir /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf.d --config /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml\r\nE0510 13:47:28.749138    9050 run.go:74] \"command failed\" err=\"failed to merge kubelet configs: failed to walk through kubelet dropin directory \\\"/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf.d\\\": failed to load kubelet dropin file, path: /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf.d/20-kubelet.conf, error: kubelet config file \\\"/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf.d/20-kubelet.conf\\\" was empty\"\r\n```\r\nIf there is just one space or an newline in that file it crashes with:\r\n```\r\n>kubelet --config-dir /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf.d --config /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml\r\nE0510 13:49:26.243517    9062 run.go:74] \"command failed\" err=<\r\n        failed to merge kubelet configs: failed to walk through kubelet dropin directory \"/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf.d\": failed to load kubelet dropin file, path: /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf.d/20-kubelet.conf, error: Object 'Kind' is missing in '\r\n        '\r\n```\r\nEven when the docs say:\r\n\r\n> These files may contain partial configurations and might not be valid config files by themselves. Validation is only performed on the final resulting configuration structure stored internally in the kubelet. \r\n\r\nIf there is nothing or only whitspaces in  `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf.d` the merged config should not be invalid and not every file in `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf.d` must contain a `kind` property.\r\n\r\n**Setup 2**:\r\nThe `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf.d/20-kubelet.conf` is the same as the `/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml` the kubelet panics and crashes with:\r\n```\r\n> kubelet --config-dir /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf.d --config /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml\r\npanic: non-positive interval for NewTicker\r\n\r\ngoroutine 1 [running]:\r\ntime.NewTicker(0xc00098f7a0?)\r\n        time/tick.go:22 +0xe5\r\nk8s.io/klog/v2/internal/clock.RealClock.NewTicker(...)\r\n        k8s.io/klog/v2@v2.120.1/internal/clock/clock.go:111\r\nk8s.io/klog/v2.(*flushDaemon).run(0xc000229650, 0x0)\r\n        k8s.io/klog/v2@v2.120.1/klog.go:1169 +0x10f\r\nk8s.io/klog/v2.StartFlushDaemon(0x0)\r\n        k8s.io/klog/v2@v2.120.1/klog.go:1220 +0x36\r\nk8s.io/component-base/logs/api/v1.apply(0xc0008c8a38, 0x0, {0x7f1ede53b2f0, 0xc000557130})\r\n        k8s.io/component-base/logs/api/v1/options.go:285 +0x890\r\nk8s.io/component-base/logs/api/v1.validateAndApply(0xc0008c8a38, 0x0, {0x7f1ede53b2f0, 0xc000557130}, 0x4?)\r\n        k8s.io/component-base/logs/ap\n...

Both in terms of flags and config file.\r\n\r\nThese two options are not mutually exclusive; they are designed to work together. When both are used, the kubelet should first load the configuration from the `--config` file and then apply any settings from the files in the `--config-dir`, with the latter taking precedence. This means that if there are conflicting settings, those in the drop-in directory will override those specified in the primary configuration file. Regarding the issue, the kubelet should be able to handle such scenarios gracefully without resulting in a crash.

When `activepod` consumes 500MB, `termpod` is evicted, which means the container and sandbox are deleted in the runtime.\n3. `activepod` gets completed without being evicted.\n\nAs far as I tried a few times, there were both cases where `activepod` gets succeeded and evicted.\n\nI suspect the disk usage might be updated asynchronously after the terminated pod is deleted so that the summary might has an older value:\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/f3cbd79db7f0c86a2d3602fdff6b174543d2cf1c/pkg/kubelet/eviction/eviction_manager.go#L477\n---\n\nUser 'AnishShah' said:\n---\n@hshiina , `DeleteAllUnusedContainers` does not delete terminated pods by default.

It deletes terminated pods only if you use the deprecated flag [`minimum-container-ttl-duration`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/cmd/kubelet/app/options/options.go#L313C44-L313C74).\n> \n> Can you check if you're using that?\n\nI didn't use `minimum-container-ttl-duration`.\n\nMy understanding is:\n1. Without `minimum-container-ttl-duration`, all containers that are not running are regarded as evictable no matter when they are created because `minAge` is `0`:\n   https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/2d0a4f75560154454682b193b42813159b20f284/pkg/kubelet/kuberuntime/kuberuntime_gc.go#L197-L207\n2.

I used the following pods:\n\n#### Terminated pod\nThis pod should be marked as `Completed` before executing the Running pod, and its image is big enough (4.67GB) to remove disk pressure when the image is cleaned up.\n```\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: android\nspec:\n  restartPolicy: Never\n  containers:\n  - name: android\n    image: cimg/android:2024.11.1-ndk\n    command: [\"sh\", \"-c\", \"sleep 0\"]\n    volumeMounts:\n    - name: tmp-volume\n      mountPath: /tmp\n  volumes:\n  - name: tmp-volume\n    emptyDir: {}\n```\n\n#### Runnning pod\nThis pod writes 10GB of storage, and is expected to continue running even when it causes disk pressure on the node, as the cleaning of the terminated pod frees up enough resources to remove the disk pressure.\n```\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: over-limit\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: over-limit\n    image: busybox\n    command: [\"sh\", \"-c\", \"dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/largefile bs=1M count=10000 && sleep infinity\"]\n    volumeMounts:\n    - name: tmp-volume\n      mountPath: /tmp\n  volumes:\n  - name: tmp-volume\n    emptyDir: {}\n```\n---"}
{"instruction": "A user reported the following issue titled 'The PodAndContainerStatsFromCRI feature doesn\u2019t expose metrics.' in the 'kubernetes/kubernetes' repository. Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\n### What happened?\n\nHello, I\u2019m a bit confused about the progress of KEP 2371. When I enable this feature, I can no longer get a large number of metrics from the /metrics/cadvisor endpoint. From the /stats/summary endpoint, I\u2019m not sure whether the corresponding metrics are available\u2014it feels more like statistics data rather than metrics. Because of this, I\u2019m a bit puzzled.\n\n1.For the metrics provided through CRI, is there a better way to observe them? Especially regarding whether there are differences before and after the feature is enabled.

Next log entry Feb 25 21:39:05 ) it would be helpful to understand why this gap exists in the first place.\n\nIf you can reproduce the issue on a local cluster and provide more datapoints would be helpful, as it is know I agree with @HirazawaUi conclusion.\n\n@alyssa1303 setting this issue to needs more information from author\n---\n\nUser 'alyssa1303' said:\n---\nHi @esotsal! Sorry for the late response. I tried with k8s 1.32 and still see the same error. Can you confirm that you actually deploy 100 pods in a single node instead of spreading across multiple nodes? It's easier to reproduce when there's a burst of pods in a node. Also, can you check if you enable parallel pull image on your kubelet settings? I suspect it might be related. \n\n```\ncat messages.log | grep \"Observed pod startup duration\"\nMar 21 03:13:19 aks-userpool0-13101832-vmss000000 kubelet[3277]: I0321 03:13:19.200417    3277

{"instruction": "A user reported the following issue titled 'Job with no parellelism randomly creates 2 duplicate Pods instead of 1' in the 'kubernetes/kubernetes' repository. Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\n### What happened?\n\nA Job is created with completions: 1,  parallelism: 1. However, two pods appear a few minutes apart, both with identical `ownerReferences` (name, uid, etc. all point to the same unique Job).\n\nI don't understand what I see in the `kube-controller-manager` logs, when the first pod is scheduled, I see\n```\nI0305 18:28:46.167341       1 job_controller.go:566] \"enqueueing job\" logger=\"job-controller\" key=\"the-namesapce/the-job-name-1741199325\"\n```\n\nThat same \"enqueueing job\" log  line repeats 9 times, most in the same second, some a bit later:\n```\nI0305 18:28:46.167341 ...\nI0305 18:28:46.183597 ...\nI0305 18:28:46.192648 ...\nI0305 18:28:46.195377 ...\nI0305 18:28:46.233094 ...\nI0305 18:28:48.915103 ...\nI0305 18:29:24.315840 ...\nI0305 18:29:25.328100 ...\nI0305 18:29:26.339424 ...\n```\n\nAt few minutes later, with the first pod is already running, a second one appears. At this exact time the logs show a similar message:\n```\nI0305 18:31:46.236414       1 job_controller.go:566] \"enqueueing job\" logger=\"job-controller\" key=\"the-namesapce/the-job-name-1741199325\"\nI0305 18:31:47.613379       1 job_controller.go:566] \"enqueueing job\" logger=\"job-controller\" key=\"the-namesapce/the-job-name-1741199325\"\nE0305 18:31:50.044308       1 job_controller.go:599] syncing job: tracking status: adding uncounted pods to status: Operation cannot be fulfilled on jobs.batch \"the-job-name-1741199325\": the object has been modified; please apply your changes to the latest version and try again\n...\nI0305 18:31:51.068789       1 job_controller.go:566] \"enqueueing job\" logger=\"job-controller\" ....

The Job object has been created with a single \"kubectl create -f job.yaml\", nothing fancy in it. What could be going on? \n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nOnly one Pod should be scheduled.\n\n### How can we reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?\n\nUnfortunately, this seems to happen randomly (once in hundreds of Jobs). I need help understanding what causes this, if I do, I can try to reproduce it.\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\nSomething similar seems to have been reported for a very old version #120790, but it's difficult to understand if it's the same.\n\n### Kubernetes version\n\n<details>\n\n```console\n$ kubectl version\nClient Version: v1.30.4\nKustomize Version: v5.0.4-0.20230601165947-6ce0bf390ce3\nServer Version: v1.30.4\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Cloud provider\n\n<details>\nOn-prem 20 node cluster deployed with Kubespray.\n</details>\n\n\n### OS version\n\n<details>\n\n```console\n$ cat /etc/os-release\nPRETTY_NAME=\"Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)\"\nNAME=\"Debian GNU/Linux\"\nVERSION_ID=\"12\"\nVERSION=\"12 (bookworm)\"\nVERSION_CODENAME=bookworm\nID=debian\nHOME_URL=\"https://www.debian.org/\"\nSUPPORT_URL=\"https://www.debian.org/support\"\nBUG_REPORT_URL=\"https://bugs.debian.org/\"\n\n$ uname -a\nLinux [redacted host name] 6.1.0-28-cloud-amd64 #1 \n...

At this moment let's wait and see. Still the test has never failed so we should be good.\n---\n\nUser 'serathius' said:\n---\nThere was no improvement in POST latency of events. Looking at the number of events in scalability tests the latency increase makes sense. With over 1 million events the cost of just listing keys is huge. Options:\n* Disable estimating resource size for events. PR: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133873\n* Implement pagination for keysOnly. With internal page size of 10'000, listing 1 million keys doesn't seem like a good idea.\n---\n\nUser 'serathius' said:\n---\nFound possible other reason for higher load on events. We run 2 storages on events, which means twice the calls to getKeys.\n\n```\n$ kubectl logs -n kube-system kube-apiserver-kind-control-plane | grep \"New\" | cut -d' ' -f12- | sort | uniq\netcd3.New\"

{"instruction": "A user reported the following issue titled 'Regression 1.34 -- Kubelet requires restart after gRPC connection to DRA driver goes idle' in the 'kubernetes/kubernetes' repository. Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\nThis issue describes a bug in DRA's plugin communication with the kubelet that causes pods to get stuck in the Terminating state. This only occurs after waiting a *long* time (in my original test case 75 minutes).\n\nAfter some testing, I've concluded that this occurs when gRPC connections to DRA plugins go idle after their configured timeout period. The issue becomes reproducible after 1 minute by shortening the idle timeout to 1 minute using `grpc.WithIdleTimeout(time.Minute)`, showing that the problem is related to gRPC's idle connection handling.\n\nOnce we reach this point where the gRPC connection has gone idle, attempting to terminate a pod with DRA allocated resourcces hang during cleanup, with the kubelet logging `Calling NodeUnprepareResource rpc` but never logging the corresponding `Done calling` message. The gRPC calls to the DRA plugin never complete despite having a 45-second context timeout.\n\nNote, that The DRA plugin never receives the `NodeUnprepareResources` requests that kubelet claims to be sending. This indicates that the hang occurs after the kubelet sends the request but before it reaches the plugin, pointing to an issue in gRPC's internal connection management.\n\nThe only current workaround for users is to restart kubelet, which forces fresh connection establishment and resolves the stuck pods until the next idle timeout period expires.\n\nSeveral remediation approaches were tested with mixed results. Adding fallback timeouts and manual connection closure attempts failed to unblock the hanging calls. However, enabling the `ResourceHealthStatus` feature gate *does* resolve the issue because it maintains persistent gRPC streams that prevent connections from going idle. Two other solutions I tried worked: disabling idle timeouts with `grpc.WithIdleTimeout(0)`, and implementing connection health checking that recreates connections when they're not in the `Ready` state.\n\nThe proposed (short-term) fix combines both approaches. It disables idle timeouts, and adds connection state validation before each RPC call, automatically recreating connections that have gone idle. This should provide protection against both the immediate idle timeout bug and other potential connection staleness issues in long-running kubelet processes.\n\nIn the long run, we need to dig into `gRPC` itself and see why this hang is occurring at all.\n\n## Steps to reproduce\n\n* Install the NVIDIA DRA driver for GPUs\n\n```shell\nhelm install nvidia-dra-driver-gpu deployments/helm/nvidia-dra-driver-gpu \\\n    --create-namespace \\\n    --namespace nvidia-dra-driver-gpu \\\n    --set nvidiaDriverRoot=/run/nvidia/driver \\\n    --set gpuResourcesEnabledOverride=true\n```\n\n* Run a workload\n\n```shell\nkubectl apply -f demo/specs/imex/mn-channel-injection.yaml\n```\n\n* See the relevant pods running\n\n```shell\n$ kubectl get pod -A\n...\ndefault                 mn-imex-channel-injection-57b546bc47-6mngm                    1/1     Running     0             7s\ndefault                 mn-imex-channe\n...

So this is known to work in 1.33? What changed that caused this?\n\nThe last changes in this space where:\n- 1.33: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129832\n- 1.34: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132058 - reacts to connection end, should ignore idle\n- 1.34: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130606\n---\n\nUser 'pohly' said:\n---\n> It should not be possible for the first log line to be called without the second.\n>\n> It suggests the call to client.NodeUnprepareResources(ctx, req) never returns (despite the context with the timeout). Note that the call into client.NodeUnprepareResources() is into the generated PB code (which feels unlikely to be incorrect). We also never see \"internal error: unsupported chosen service\" anywhere in the logs.\n>\n> Not sure how this is possible or what is going on here.\n\nBefore we discuss workarounds let's figure out why it gets stuck and where.\n\nIn your suggested workaround, the application layer (our code) is retrieving the gRPC connection state and then reacting to it. It's unlikely, but the state could change for the worse after retrieving the old state and before proceeding, so this cannot be the right solution to whatever is causing this problem.\n\nA unit test with a reproducer would be a good next step. We cannot run unit tests which run as long as the default idle timeout (at least not in the CI, and during development it would be painfully slow), but as you noted, we can shorten that timeout.\n---\n\nUser 'lmktfy' said:\n---\n/sig node\n\nI'm confident the kubelet is at least involved.\n---\n\nUser 'pohly' said:\n---\nUnit test:\n\n```patch\ndiff --git

{"instruction": "A user reported the following issue titled 'APF borrowing by exempt does not match KEP' in the 'kubernetes/kubernetes' repository. Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\n### What happened?\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the KEP and the implementation, I noticed a difference in the way that the exempt priority level borrows from the others. In the KEP, in section https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/1040-priority-and-fairness#dispatching (this material was added in https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3906), we see (among many other things) the following definition.\r\n\r\n```\r\nMinCurrentCL(i) = max( MinCL(i), min( NominalCL(i), HighSeatDemand(i) ) ) -- if non-exempt\r\nMinCurrentCL(i) = max( MinCL(i), HighSeatDemand(i) )                      -- if exempt\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in the implementation (https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/3dedb8eb8c122d0a3221a5842c1d6697d8958151/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/util/flowcontrol/apf_controller.go#L407, introduced in #118782) there is no special treatment for exempt. It gets its MinCurrentCL computed by the same formula as non-exempt levels. In the default configuration (in which the exempt priority level has a nominal concurrency limit of zero), this means that the exempt priority level gets MinCurrentCL=0.\r\n\r\nThe KEP continues with some considerations for what to do if the exempt priority levels want to use up the whole server concurrency limit, or enough to prevent the non-exempt priority levels from getting their minimum allocations. These are also absent from the implementation --- naturally enough, since those situations cannot arise in the current implementation.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nConsistency\r\n\r\n### How can we reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?\r\n\r\nThis is from code and doc inspection, as described above.\r\n\r\n### Anything else we need to know?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes version\r\n\r\n1.28.0 and later.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Cloud provider\r\n\r\n<details>\r\nN/A\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n### OS version\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Install tools\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Container runtime (CRI) and version (if applicable)\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Related plugins (CNI, CSI, ...) and versions (if applicable)\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n</details>", "response": "The issue was addressed with the following discussion:\n\nUser 'MikeSpreitzer' said:\n---\nA short version of the difference is this: the KEP says that the exempt priority level gets everything it wants and the other levels compete over the rest of the server's concurrency limit, while the implementation has the exempt priority level competing with the others on a level playing field.\n---\n\nUser 'MikeSpreitzer' said:\n---\n/cc @tkashem \r\n/cc @wojtek-t \r\n/cc @deads2k\n---\n\nUser 'MikeSpreitzer' said:\n---\n@kubernetes/sig-api-machinery-bugs\n---\n\nUser 'wojtek-t' said:\n---\nI think we should fix that to what is described in the KEP -

{"instruction": "A user reported the following issue titled 'kubectl edit: \"You can run `kubectl replace -f FILE` to try this update again\" misleading if user passed flags such as `--context`' in the 'kubernetes/kubernetes' repository. Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\n### What happened?\r\n\r\nI ran `kubectl --context=dev edit statefulset/kafka` and got a permissions error (my GKE user did not have appropriate permissions). I had used `--context=dev` to select a particular cluster.\r\n\r\nAfter the permissions error, kubectl printed\r\n\r\n```\r\nYou can run `kubectl replace -f /var/folders/5y/55wpzs4n79v91k_2jf35354w0000gp/T/kubectl-edit-10910983.yaml` to try this update again.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI fixed my permission error (by giving my GKE user appropriate permissions) and ran the command above, but I got this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError from server (Conflict): error when replacing \"/var/folders/5y/55wpzs4n79v91k_2jf35354w0000gp/T/kubectl-edit-10910983.yaml\": Operation cannot be fulfilled on statefulsets.apps \"kafka\": StorageError: invalid object, Code: 4, Key: /registry/statefulsets/kafka-default/kafka, ResourceVersion: 0, AdditionalErrorMsg: Precondition failed: UID in precondition: 545e2602-484d-4c17-91ce-52bddf06e81e, UID in object meta: a280573a-fcd0-4771-a302-c48d1d47972f\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is because the original `edit` command I ran included `--context=dev` and the suggested \"try again\" command did not \u2014 I was sending this command to the wrong cluster!\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nRunning the command printed by `kubectl edit` would run the same operation as my original operation, not talk to a different cluster.\r\n\r\nEither:\r\n- kubectl recognizes that relevant options like `--context` were passed by the user and includes them in the suggested command\r\n- kubectl recognizes that relevant options like `--context` were passed by the user and decides not to suggest a command at all if it doesn't want to reproduce them\r\n- kubectl includes more context from the original command in the file it writes and the command it suggests uses that full context\r\n- The message printed could explicitly call out that you need to set things like context in the same way as the original command.\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, it's not particularly obvious that you *do* have to add `--context` yourself to the follow-up command but you *don't* have to add `--namespace`. I can reason it out based on having a somewhat sophisticated mental model of k8s/kubectl but telling people to run a write command that might talk to the wrong cluster seems like something to avoid!\r\n\r\n### How can we reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?\r\n\r\nThe issue is pretty clear from [the source](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/475ee33f698334e5b00c58d3bef4083840ec12c5/staging/src/k8s.io/kubectl/pkg/cmd/util/editor/editoptions.go#L400C28-L400C83): the suggested command never includes extra flags like `--context`.\r\n\r\n### Anything else we need to know?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes version\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n```console\r\nClient Version: v1.29.3\r\nKustomize Version: v5.0.4-0.20230601165947-6ce0bf390ce3\r\nServer Version: v1.29.9-gke.1496000```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Cloud provider\r\n\r\n<details>\r\nGKE\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n### OS version\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n```console\r\nDarwin D\n...

Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\n### What happened?\n\nIn #132532 and #133136 a warning was added for unrecognized formats. However, the `int32`, `int64`, `float`, and `double` formats are flagged ~~and this conflicts with public docs: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#format which say that these values are supported formats~~.

IMHO this is not a \"creative\" usage of it, but actually an ABUSE of it. It looks like the intelligent API server tries to drive the stupid clients into a certain behaviour, and I am sorry to tell you - it is neither its responsibility nor its job. Let the clients decide what they want to do when requests fail.\nThe reason a pod cannot be evicted due to PDB is a classic [409 Conflict](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/409): `request conflict with the current state of the target resource`. It doesn't matter the client \"did not set a precondition\", this is an excuse, you don't have a 5xx status code to describe conflicts. The only thing you have is 409. This is NEVER EVER a 429.\nIn my case, all I try to do is to perform a pod eviction `in All dry-run mode`, to see if it's possible. If it is, evict the pod.\nI set up a test case with a Deployment of 2 replicas and PDB with min healthy of 2. Maybe stupid, but that's something k8s API gladly allows. The VERY FIRST `/eviction` REQUEST gets a 429 which actually can never be recovered, this will be an endless loop with 429s... Thank you for this, API server.\nIt gets worse if the client uses an HTTP retry library - like [this](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-retryablehttp). These libraries are trained to retry to a **genuine** 429 due to rate-limiting. This required ideally the `Retry-after` HTTP response header (which the current API server doesn't even bother to set).\nSo all I am left with is to have to analyze the response for a 429 (which should never ever have been done as it's not part of the HTTP 429 \"standard\") i.s.o. the response header. This is not ugly, this is FUGLY.\nPlease just return a standard 409 like us mortals would return. Thank you.\n---"}

\nFor a fix I would just disable measuring stats for resources that don't set it now: `apiServerIPInfo` `servicenodeportallocations`.\n\nConsequences:\n* No `apiserver_resource_size_estimate_bytes` metric for those resources.\n* APF might overestimate cost of LIST request for those resources. However I don't think they are exposed in API.\n---\n\nUser 'maksat-yskak' said:\n---\n> --service-cluster-ip-range=xxx \\\n\nAre you changing this or using xxx?

{"instruction": "A user reported the following issue titled 'api: v1.KubeSchedulerConfiguration Go type is not compatible with controller-gen' in the 'kubernetes/kubernetes' repository. Please provide a summary of the discussion that led to its resolution.\n\nISSUE DESCRIPTION:\n## What would you like to be added?\r\n\r\nI am using the `kubescheduler.config.k8s.io/v1.KubeSchedulerConfiguration` type as a field in my CustomResourceDefinition. However, when I try to generate CRD manifests from the Go type for the CRD using the command I get various errors.\r\n\r\n## Why is this needed\r\n\r\nI'm curious if this use case is supported. It can help projects like kubeadm, [Cluster API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/) or [Kamaji](https://kamaji.clastix.io/) accept KubeSchedulerConfiguration objects as a field to customize the provisioned cluster's kube-scheduler config differently between clusters. The only other option to do so is to either deal with `runtime.RawExtensions` or use a YAML/JSON stored as `string`.\r\n\r\n## Errors from `controller-gen crd`\r\n\r\nWhen I use the `controller-gen crd` command to generate CustomResourceDefinition manifests for a Go type that has a struct member of type KubeSchedulerConfiguration, I get errors about float types (presumably QPS/Burst) in the `componentbaseconfigv1alpha1.ClientConnectionConfiguration`:\r\n\r\n> `\r\n/Users/abalkan/go-athens/pkg/mod/k8s.io/component-base@v0.29.1/config/v1alpha1/types.go:79:6: found float, the usage of which is highly discouraged, as support for them varies across languages. Please consider serializing your float as string instead. If you are really sure you want to use them, re-run with crd:allowDangerousTypes=true`\r\n\r\nAnd a few errors about various [[]byte fields](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-scheduler/blob/94ff27f8b9eb26561417aa148314397395e6faef/config/v1/types.go#L385-L396) that have `+listType=atomic`:\r\n\r\n> `/Users/abalkan/go-athens/pkg/mod/k8s.io/kube-scheduler@v0.29.1/config/v1/types.go:388:2: must apply listType to an array, found string`\r\n\r\n> `/Users/abalkan/go-athens/pkg/mod/k8s.io/kube-scheduler@v0.29.1/config/v1/types.go:392:2: must apply listType to an array, found string`\r\n\r\n> `/Users/abalkan/go-athens/pkg/mod/k8s.io/kube-scheduler@v0.29.1/config/v1/types.go:396:2: must apply listType to an array, found string`\r\n\r\n/sig scheduling\r\n/sig api-machinery\r\n/kind bug", "response": "The issue was addressed with the following discussion:\n\nUser 'kerthcet' said:\n---\n/triage accept\n---\n\nUser 'k8s-ci-robot' said:\n---\n@kerthcet: The label(s) `triage/accept` cannot be applied, because the repository doesn't have them.\n\n<details>\n\nIn response to [this](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/124201#issuecomment-2041301544):\n\n>/triage accept\n\n\nInstructions for interacting with me using PR comments are available [here](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/guide/pull-requests.md).

This can lead to the following sequence:\r\n* As a part of draining a kubernetes node, a pod might get deleted.\r\n* The unmount of a pod could take more than 6 minutes.\r\n* If the node is deemed unhealthy when the 6 minute timer fires for the pod being deleted (for example, because kubelet is still restarting), then the underlying PV will be force detached (via a `ControllerUnpublishVolume` RPC)\r\n\r\nThese workflows would likely benefit from disabling this feature in lieu of the Non-Graceful Node Shutdown feature that hit GA in kubernetes 1.28 (see [here](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/08/16/kubernetes-1-28-non-graceful-node-shutdown-ga/) for more details).\r\n\r\nWhen these issues are encountered in our testbeds, we are left with Zombie iSCSI LUNs. If pods end up migrating to a node with such a Zombie LUN present, those pods might end up attaching themselves to the Zombie LUN leading to data corruption.\r\n\r\nThis data corruption has caused a number of our cluster-management applications to lose all access to their data, requiring them to be deployed from scratch (occasionally causing downtime for the entire cluster).\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nThe ControllerUnpublishVolume request to wait indefinitely until NodeUnstageVolume has succeeded.\n\n### How can we reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?\n\nSee the \u201cWhat happened?\u201d section for more details.\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Kubernetes version\n\n<details>\r\n\r\n```console\r\nroot@bootstrapper:~# kubectl version\r\nClient Version: version.Info{Major:\"1\", Minor:\"23\", GitVersion:\"v1.23.5\", GitCommit:\"c285e781331a3785a7f436042c65c5641ce8a9e9\", GitTreeState:\"clean\", BuildDate:\"2022-03-16T15:58:47Z\", GoVersion:\"go1.17.8\", Compiler:\"gc\", Platform:\"linux/amd64\"}\r\nServer Version: version.Info{Major:\"1\", Minor:\"27\", GitVersion:\"v1.27.4-gke.500\", GitCommit:\"a955253697d6572565777f63dfe6df9fd74591a2\", GitTreeState:\"clean\", BuildDate:\"2023-07-26T09:27:11Z\", GoVersion:\"go1.20.6 X:boringcrypto\", Compiler:\"gc\", Platform:\"linux/amd64\"}\r\nWARNING: version difference between client (1.23) and server (1.27) exceeds the supported minor version skew of +/-1\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\n\n### Cloud provider\n\n<details>\r\nGoogle\r\n</details>\r\n\n\n### OS version\n\n<details>\r\n\r\n```console\r\n# On Linux:\r\n$ cat /etc/os-release\r\n# paste output here\r\n$ uname -a\r\n# paste output here\r\n\r\n# On Windows:\r\nC:\\> wmic os get Caption, Version, BuildNumber, OSArchitecture\r\n# paste output here\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\n\n### Install tools\n\n<details>\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\n\n### Container runtime (CRI) and version (if applicable)\n\n<details>\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\n\n### Related plugins (CNI, CSI, ...) and versions (if applicable)\n\n<details>\r\n\r\n</details>", "response": "The issue was addressed with the following discussion:\n\nUser 'rohitssingh' said:\n---\n/sig Storage\r\n\r\nTagging @bswartz, @msau42, @saad-ali, @jingxu97\n---\n\nUser 'Devesh-N' said:\n---\nHi @rohitssingh \r\n\r\nThank you for the detailed issue report. The issue you've described with zombie iSCSI LUNs during Kubernetes upgrades sounds concerning, especially with the data corruption implications for cluster-management applications.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I noticed there's a version skew between your client (1.23) and server (1.27) that exceeds the supported minor version skew of +/-1. While this may not be directly related to the issue you're facing, it's generally a good idea to align the versions for more consistent behavior.\r\n\r\nRegarding the ControllerUnpublishVolume behavior, the intent of the 6-minute timer was to provide a timeout for certain scenarios, but it seems that in your case, it leads to undesirable outcomes. Since Kubernetes 1.28 introduced the Non-Graceful Node Shutdown feature, you're correct that disabling the previous timer-based feature could be beneficial.\r\n\r\nPossible Solutions and Next Steps:\r\nUpgrade to Kubernetes 1.28 or later: If possible, consider upgrading your Kubernetes cluster to take advantage of the Non-Graceful Node Shutdown feature.\r\n\r\nFurther Investigation: We would like to reproduce this issue in a controlled environment to understand it better. Would you be willing to share additional logs that could be useful?\r\n\r\nTemporary Workaround: As an immediate workaround, you may consider scripting a manual detach procedure that accounts for the time needed for NodeUnstageVolume to succeed.\r\n\r\nWe'll be looking into this issue more thoroughly. I'll keep you updated on our findings and potential fixes.\r\n\r\nThanks again for bringing this to our attention. Your detailed explanation is invaluable in understanding the severity and specifics of the problem.\n---\n\nUser 'rohitssingh' said:\n---\nThanks for the detailed feedback @Devesh-N.\r\n\r\nI'm in the process of uploading an associated PR; it'll be coming out shortly.\r\n\r\n> We would like to reproduce this issue in a controlled environment to understand it better. Would you be willing to share additional logs that could be useful?\r\n\r\nI think we can reproduce this by stopping kubelet on a node, killing a pod with a PV on that node, and then also bringing down the CSI node driver pod.\r\n\r\nWe would like everything to just wait for kubelet & the CSI node driver pod to be restored. But the 6-minute timer ends up firing leaving with PVs in the forced detach state.\n---\n\nUser 'Devesh-N' said:\n---\nHi @rohitssingh ,\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt response, and I'm glad to hear that you're already working on a PR for this issue.\r\n\r\nYour steps for reproducing the problem by stopping kubelet and killing a pod with a PV on the affected node provide a clear path for investigating this further. We'll use this method to reproduce the issue on our end as well.\r\n\r\nRegarding the 6-Minute Timer:\r\nThe 6-minute timer was designed to handle certain edge cases, but as you've pointed out, it can cause more problems than it solves in specific scenarios like yours. It makes sense to reassess this feature, especially in the context of how it interacts with kubelet and CSI node driver pod outages.\r\n\r\nNext Steps:\r\nReview Your PR: Once your PR is submitted, we will review it as promptly as possible.\r\nInternal Reproduction: We will also try to reproduce the issue internally, using the steps you've provided, to better understand the root cause and any possible fixes or workarounds.\r\nDiscuss Possible Improvements: As part of our ongoing efforts, we will discuss whether we can make improvements to Kubernetes that would eliminate the need for a forced detach after the 6-minute timer elapses, especially when kubelet and the CSI node driver pod are expected to recover.\r\nWe appreciate your continued involvement and detailed input as we work towards resolving this issue.

Specifically, the problem was that the storage controller thought a LUN id was free for use (because of ControllerUnpublishVolume) when in fact it was still in use by a k8s node.\n\nTo reproduce this issue, I would suggest that you:\n* Inject errors in the NodeUnstageVolume path for a particular LUN.\n* Cordon the node that is running a pod that uses said LUN.\n* Delete the pod that was using that LUN.\n* The pod should try to come up on another node, leaving a \"zombie\" device behind.\n\nIf you then uncordon the node in question and cordon all other nodes and then start creating new pods that use new PVs, eventually the underlying storage controller will re-use the LUN id that was used by the \"zombie\" device; the LUN that comes up with this id will be in the state I mentioned above.\n\nI hope that helps!\n---\n\nUser 'akalenyu' said:\n---\nThanks! just to make sure, the original LUN from the pod is the one getting corrupted? So the data of the original application?\n\nOr in some weird way the other \"new\" LUNs get corrupted?\n---\n\nUser 'bswartz' said:\n---\n> Thanks! just to make sure, the original LUN from the pod is the one getting corrupted? So the data of the original application?\n> \n> Or in some weird way the other \"new\" LUNs get corrupted?\n\nThere are two cases to consider:\n1) In the situation where the storage system can reuse the same LUN number for two different volumes, the main worry is that the new LUN gets confused with the old LUN, and the new LUN gets corrupted because it's mapped to a LUN number that the node things belongs to the old volume. In this case the old volume is safe, having been detached, and the risk comes from the confusion caused by reuse of numbers.\n2) You can have a case when the volume gets detached after 6 minutes, and attached to another node, then later detached and reattached back to the original node. Since the node doesn't know that another node has mounted/unmounted the volume in the meantime, it may think it's had exclusive access all long and will flush dirty buffers to the disk once it regains access. This would corrupt the original volume.\n\nBoth problems stem from the lack of node-side cleanup when the 6-minute force detach triggers. For this reason the only safe thing to do is to disable the 6-minute timer, and handle dead nodes by actually rebooting them and tainting the node.\n---\n\nUser 'akalenyu' said:\n---\nThank you for the answer, I think I am more interested in 2\n\n> 2\\. it may think it's had exclusive access all long and will flush dirty buffers to the disk once it regains access\n\nIs the existence of these dirty buffers realistic in a k8s environment? Where would dirty data come from? the first iteration of the workload (on this node?) Is that even possible?\n\nAnother question, I saw some drivers implementing guard rails (for what it looks like) against this problem:\nhttps://github.com/NetApp/trident/commit/b33021d64da7588d65b7f38cda7cd01873850e14\n(Second point)\nI guess those guard rails make sense regardless of the force detach behavior, since any bug in the driver could lead to a \"force detach\". WDYT?\n---\n\nUser 'rohitssingh' said:\n---\nThe worst case I encountered was actually a combination of the two cases that Ben mentioned.\n\nLet us say that we have two volumes in use by two different pods:\n```\nV in use by pod p\nW in use by pod q\n```\n\nAnd two k8s hosts:\n```\nN\nO\n```\n\nAlong with three random LUN ids:\n```\ni\nj\nk\n```\n\nLet us assume that our LUN mappings are unique to each k8s host.\n\nIf initially `V` is mapped to `N` @ `i`, we will have the following LUN mappings:\n\n```\nOn k8s Hosts\t\t\tOn the Storage Controllers\n============\t\t\t==========================\nN:\ni -> V\t\t\t\t\ti -> V \n\nO:\nN/A\t\t\t\t\t\tN/A\n```\n\nThis looks fine so far.\n\nBut things can get broken if we try to migrate pod `p`, which uses `V`, to `O`.\n\nNode N has 6 minutes to tear down `V` so that it can be resurrected on `O`. However, if the timer fires before cleanup finishes, then KCM will prematurely issue a `ControllerUnpublishVolume` leading to a force detach.\n\nThis will leave us with:\n```\nOn k8s Hosts\t\t\tOn the Storage Controllers\n============\t\t\t==========================\nN:\ni -> V\t\t\t\t\tN/A\n\nO:\nN/A\t\t\t\t\t\tN/A\n```\n\nLater, KCM will issue a `ControllerPublishVolume` for `V` on `O`, leaving:\n```\nOn k8s Hosts\t\t\tOn the Storage Controllers\n============\t\t\t==========================\nN:\ni -> V\t\t\t\t\tN/A\n\nO:\nj -> V\t\t\t\t\tj -> V \n```\n\nwhere `j` is some LUN id that was free for use in `O`'s mapping space.\n\nThe state on node `N` is not correct and can now result in serious problems after more pods get scheduled. Among other issues, this is dangerous because all of `V`'s buffers might not be flushed and committed at the time the mapping is broken. But as we will see, we have bigger problems too...\n\nIf pod `q` now gets scheduled on `N`, the storage controller is free to allocate any available LUN id; since it believes `i` is available, it is free to use it again.\n\nIf it does opt to allocate `i` here, we will then have the following mappings:\n```\nOn k8s Hosts\t\t\tOn the Storage Controllers\n============\t\t\t==========================\nN:\ni -> V\t\t\t\t\tN/A\ni -> W\t\t\t\t\ti -> W\n\nO:\nj -> V\t\t\t\t\tj -> V \n```\n\nTechnically speaking, we do not yet have an problem; though we have a stale mapping for `V` on `N`, it is not actively in use.\n\nBut we will have a problem if `p` ever returns to `N`, when we will have:\n```\nOn k8s Hosts\t\t\tOn the Storage Controllers\n============\t\t\t==========================\nN:\ni -> V\t\t\t\t\tk -> V\ni -> W\t\t\t\t\ti -> W\n\nO:\nN/A\t\t\t\t\t\tN/A\n```\n\nwhere `k` is some LUN id that was free for use in `N`'s mapping space.\n\nSince the device is already established (and maybe even mounted in the appropriate namespace), the underlying machinery will then present the same LUN (i.e., `i` which is actually mapped to the LUN backing `W`) to both pods `p` & `q`. This will result in data corruption as both pods proceed to write data & flush their respective superblocks.\n\nI will let Ben speak to the driver-side mitigations (in particular, the change you referenced seems to be his handiwork :) ).\n---\n\nUser 'bswartz' said:\n---\n> Is the existence of these dirty buffers realistic in a k8s environment? Where would dirty data come from? the first iteration of the workload (on this node?) Is that even possible?\n\nRohit gave a very detailed explanation, but very shortly, the dirty data is any data written by an application or filesystem which never got acknowledged because write access was cut off by a controller unpublish. This can happen if you trigger the non-graceful-node-shutdown feature _without_ actually rebooting the node. Once the node regains write access to the volume it will continue writing without checking to see if anyone else wrote data in the mean time.\n\n> Another question, I saw some drivers implementing guard rails (for what it looks like) against this problem: [NetApp/trident@b33021d](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/commit/b33021d64da7588d65b7f38cda7cd01873850e14) (Second point) I guess those guard rails make sense regardless of the force detach behavior, since any bug in the driver could lead to a \"force detach\". WDYT?\n\nI have never successfully used the Trident force detach feature. I know that it's one of many such implementations in drivers to try to mitigate this problem. How easy or hard this is depends a lot of the underlying data protocol. iSCSI is one of the worst I've seen, thanks to how complex the Linux initiator implemenation is.\n---\n\nUser 'akalenyu' said:\n---\nThanks again for investing in replies here @rohitssingh @bswartz!\nI have tried to follow the reproducer;\n\n> If pod `q` now gets scheduled on `N`, the storage controller is free to allocate any available LUN id; since it believes `i` is available, it is free to use it again.\n> \n> If it does opt to allocate `i` here, we will then have the following mappings:\n> \n> ```\n> On k8s Hosts\t\t\tOn the Storage Controllers\n> ============\t\t\t==========================\n> N:\n> i -> V\t\t\t\t\tN/A\n> i -> W\t\t\t\t\ti -> W\n> \n> O:\n> j -> V\t\t\t\t\tj -> V \n> ```\n> \n> Technically speaking, we do not yet have an problem; though we have a stale mapping for `V` on `N`, it is not actively in use.\n\nThing is, at least with multipath, it will correct this state once a new volume/pod combo schedules on `N`.\nSo, I am seeing that it **does** opt to allocate LUN ID `i`, it just remediates the force detached state as far as `lsblk/multipath -ll` is concerned - the \"bad\" entry disappears from `multipath -ll` output.\nSo I don't think is the case for me\n> ```\n> On k8s Hosts\t\t\tOn the Storage Controllers\n> ============\t\t\t==========================\n> N:\n> i -> V\t\t\t\t\tN/A\n> ```\nand instead it's\n> ```\n> On k8s Hosts\t\t\tOn the Storage Controllers\n> ============\t\t\t==========================\n> N:\n> i -> W\t\t\t\t\ti -> W\n> ```\n\nAnd thus upon completing the reproducer's execution, I see no corruption.\nI think these multipath logs are related to the remediation\n```\nmultipathd[32318]: sdc: path wwid changed from 'FORCE_DETACHED_WWID' to 'NEW_WWID'\n...\nmultipathd[32318]: 8:32: path removed from map FORCE_DETACHED_WWID\nmultipathd[32318]: FORCE_DETACHED_WWID: sdd - tur checker reports path is up\nmultipathd[32318]: FORCE_DETACHED_WWID: remaining active paths: 1\nmultipathd[32318]: sdd: path wwid changed from 'FORCE_DETACHED_WWID' to 'NEW_WWID'\nmultipathd[32318]: FORCE_DETACHED_WWID Last path deleted, disabling queueing\nmultipathd[32318]: FORCE_DETACHED_WWID: map flushed after removing all paths\n```\n\nWere you encountering the issues on an environment with multipath as well?\n---\n\nUser 'rohitssingh' said:\n---\nThat's very interesting @akalenyu!\n\nI think we are using multipath too, but we never would end up down that codepath.\n\nThe last line where the map device is being flushed & removed is printed from `flush_map_nopaths` [here](https://github.com/opensvc/multipath-tools/blob/de16cf82c5263fc148118be56ebf44c8f0ee60b8/multipathd/main.c#L635C1-L637C14):\n\n```\n\tcondlog(2, \"%s: map flushed after removing all paths\", mpp->alias);\n\tremove_map_and_stop_waiter(mpp, vecs);\n\treturn true;\n```\n\nIn our case, we have `queue_if_no_path` enabled, so we wouldn't even get to this point.\n---\n\nUser 'bmarzins' said:\n---\n@rohitssingh this log message:\n```\nmultipathd[32318]: FORCE_DETACHED_WWID Last path deleted, disabling queueing\n```\nmeans `flush_on_last_del` is enabled and it disabled `queue_if_no_path` when the last path was deleted.\n\n@akalenyu  looking at those logs, it looks like they are already consistent with a situation where corruption can occur. These two lines:\n```\nmultipathd[32318]: FORCE_DETACHED_WWID: sdd - tur checker reports path is up\nmultipathd[32318]: FORCE_DETACHED_WWID: remaining active paths: 1\n```\nare printed by the path checker. Specifically `remaining active paths` is printed after the path is re-enabled. The line where the changed WWID is noticed:\n```\nmultipathd[32318]: sdd: path wwid changed from 'FORCE_DETACHED_WWID' to 'NEW_WWID'\n```\nis printed when multipathd processes the uevent that presumably was issued when the LUN reappeared, and it appears after the path checker lines. The moment that the path is re-enabled in the kernel, it is able to flush any queued IO to it. This means that if there was queued IO to that device, these logs appear to show a window where the kernel could have sent it to the bad path before multipathd removed it. It is possible to close this window by setting the `recheck_wwid` configuration parameter. This will check for changed WWIDs whenever a path comes back online. That still can't remove the possibility of corruption completely. It is possible that a path changes WWIDs without multipathd ever noticing that it went down, and IO could go to it before multipathd processes the uevent for the change.\n---"}
