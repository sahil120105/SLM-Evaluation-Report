# How the web works

{{NextMenu("Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Web_standards/The_Web_standards_model", "Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Web_standards")}}

_How the web works_ provides a high-level description of what happens when you use a web browser to navigate to a web page, explaining the magic that goes on behind the scenes to deliver the relevant code to your computer for the browser to assemble into something you can look at.

This theory is not essential to writing web code in the short term, but before long you'll really start to benefit from understanding what's happening in the background.

> [!NOTE]
> This article does not cover how web browsers actually render code into web pages. That's covered in [How browsers load websites](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Web_standards/How_browsers_load_websites).

## Clients and servers

Computers connected to the internet are called **clients** and **servers**. A simplified diagram of how they interact might look like this:

![Two circles representing client and server. An arrow labelled request is going from client to server, and an arrow labelled responses is going from server to client](simple-client-server.png)

- Clients are the typical web user's internet-connected devices (for example, your computer connected to your Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to your mobile network) and web-accessing software available on those devices (usually a web browser like Firefox or Chrome).
- Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. When a client wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage code is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be rendered by the browser and displayed to the user.

## The other parts of the toolbox

The client and server we've described above don't tell the whole story. There are many other parts involved, and we'll describe them below.

For now, let's imagine that the internet is a road. On one end of the road is the client, which is like your house. On the other end of the road is the server, which is like a shop you want to buy something from.

![A black-and-white photo of a person crossing a road at a crosswalk](road.jpg)

In order for data to get back and forth, we need the following things:

- **Your internet connection**: Allows you to send and receive data on the internet. It's basically like the street between your house and the shop.
- **TCP/IP**: **Transmission Control Protocol** and **Internet Protocol** (TCP/IP) are communication protocols that define how data should travel across the internet. This is like the transport mechanisms that let you place an order, go to the shop, and buy your goods. In our example, this is like a car or a bike (or however else you might travel along the road).
- **DNS**: The **Domain Name System** (DNS) is like an address book for websites. When you type a web address in your browser, the browser looks at the DNS to find the website's IP address — the actual address the server is located at — before it can retrieve the website (see [DNS explained](#dns_explained) below for more information). The browser needs to find out which server the website lives on, so it can send HTTP messages to the right place (see below). This is like looking up the address of the shop before you visit it.
- **HTTP**: **Hypertext Transfer Protocol** (HTTP) is an application {{Glossary("Protocol", "protocol")}} that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other. This is like the language you use to order your goods. See [HTTP basics](#http_basics) below.
- **Files**: A website is made up of many different files, which are like the different goods you buy from the shop. These files come in two main types:
  - **Code**: Websites are built primarily from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — the different programming languages websites are written in, which the browser interprets and assembles into a web page to display to a user.
  - **Assets**: This is a collective term for all the other items that appear on a website — such as images, music, video, Word documents, and PDFs — that aren't code that the browser interprets.

  > [!NOTE]
  > You can find out how the browser assembles these files into a web page later in the course, in [How browsers load websites](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Web_standards/How_browsers_load_websites).

## So what happens, exactly?

When you type a web address (which is technically part of a [URL](#components_of_a_url)) into your browser address bar, the following steps occur:

1. The browser goes to the DNS server and finds the real address of the server that the website lives on (you look up the address of the shop).
2. The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client (you go to the shop and order your goods). This message, and all other data sent between the client and the server, is sent across your internet connection using TCP/IP.
3. If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a "200 OK" message, which means "Of course you can look at that website! Here it is", and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks called [data packets](#packets_explained) (the shop gives you your goods, and you bring them back to your house).
4. The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete web page and displays it to you (you get the goods home — new shiny stuff, awesome!).

## DNS explained

Real web addresses ([URLs](#components_of_a_url)) aren't the nice, memorable strings you type into your address bar to find your favorite websites. They are special numbers that look like this: `192.0.2.172`.

This is called an {{Glossary("IP Address", "IP address")}}, and it represents a unique location on the web. However, it's not very easy to remember, is it? That's why the Domain Name System was invented. This system uses special servers that match up a web address you type into your browser (like "mozilla.org") to the website's real (IP) address.

Websites can be reached directly via their IP addresses. You can use a DNS lookup tool to find the IP address of a website.

Let's look up the MDN IP address now, and prove that it points to the same place as the web address:

1. Go to the [NsLookup.io DNS lookup tool](https://www.nslookup.io/website-to-ip-lookup/), type in `developer.mozilla.org`, and press the button.
2. In the results screen, copy the IP Address (the IPv4 address) to your system clipboard.
3. Open a new browser tab, paste the IP Address into the address bar and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>/<kbd>Return</kbd>. You should see MDN load up, proving that the IP address points to it.

## Packets explained

Earlier we used the term "packets" to describe the format in which the data is transferred between the client and server. What do we mean here?

Basically, when data is sent across the web, it is sent in thousands of small chunks. There are multiple reasons why data is sent in small packets, but most significantly:

- They are sometimes dropped or corrupted and, when this happens, it's quicker and easier to replace small chunks than entire files.
- Additionally, the packets can be routed along different paths, making the exchange faster and allowing many different users to download the same website at the same time. If each website was sent as a single big chunk, only one user could download it at a time, which would make the web very inefficient and not much fun to use.

## HTTP basics

HTTP uses a simple language of verbs to perform actions such as making requests (see [HTTP request methods](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods)). The HTTP [`GET`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/GET) method is the one normally used to make HTTP requests of the type described above. For example, a request for the MDN home page might look like this:

```http
GET /en-US/ HTTP/2

Host: developer.mozilla.org
```

The response sent by the server might look something like this:

```http
HTTP/2 200

date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 11:13:30 GMT
expires: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 11:40:01 GMT
server: Google frontend
last-modified: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:49:32 GMT
ETag: "65f26b7f6463e2347f4e5a7a2adcee54"
content-length: 45227
content-type: text/html

<!doctype html> ... (the 45227 bytes of the requested web page HTML)
```

The full response is more complex than this, but we have omitted most of it for brevity. The main parts are as follows:

- `HTTP/2 200`
  - : The version of HTTP that the server is using to send the response, in this case HTTP/2, followed by a [status code](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status) indicating whether the request was successful. `200` indicates success.
- `date`, `expires`, etc.
  - : [HTTP headers](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers) containing additional information about the response (note that requests can have headers too), which provide extra information and/or modify its behavior.
- `<!doctype html>`, etc.
  - : The response body, which in this case contains the MDN homepage's HTML document.

> [!NOTE]
> See the MDN [HTTP reference](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) for a lot more detail on HTTP, if you are curious. [An overview of HTTP](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Overview) is a good place to start.

### Other status codes

Above, we met the `200` [status code](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status), which indicates that the HTTP request was successful. There are many HTTP status codes with specific meanings and uses, but you will only commonly see a few:

- `301`
  - : The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new location, which is provided in the response. This is used for redirecting content when it's moved.
- `400`
  - : The server can't process the request. This usually happens when the request isn't in a format the server understands, or has errors in it.
- `403`
  - : The server will not give the client access to the requested resource. This usually happens when the server knows who the client is, but they don't have permission to access the requested page.
- `404`
  - : The server cannot find the requested resource. This status is commonly returned if the URL is wrong or if content is deleted without putting a redirect in place.
- `503`
  - : The request cannot be handled due to a problem with the server. This is common when servers are offline for maintenance, and it's expected to be temporary.

## Components of a URL

Technically, web addresses that you type into the browser address bar form part of **Uniform Resource Locators** (**URLs**). URLs define the locations of unique resources on the internet.

A URL is a web address plus a protocol: for example, if you open a new tab in your browser, type in `developer.mozilla.org` into the address bar, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>/<kbd>Return</kbd>, you will be redirected to a URL like the following one:

```plain
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/
```

The main parts of the URL are:

- `https`
  - : The **protocol** being used to send the request. In this case, we are using [HTTPS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTPS), which is a secure version of HTTP that stops bad people from reading your data while it is being transported. On the modern web, pretty much every server uses HTTPS, so if you don't include it explicitly, the browser assumes that is what you are using and adds it for you.
- `developer.mozilla.org`
  - : The [**domain name**](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_domain_name) of the URL, which represents the top-level location of the server you are connecting to. In this case, the web address you typed in is equal to the domain name, but this is not always the case — you could choose to type in a more complicated web address. Note that the `developer` part is a **subdomain** (distinct content area) of Mozilla's `mozilla.org` domain. There are other subdomains on Mozilla's site that host distinct content — see [support.mozilla.org](https://support.mozilla.org/) and [bugzilla.mozilla.org](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/), for example.
- `/en-US/`
  - : The **path** to the resource on the server that you are accessing. MDN keeps all its US English content in a folder called `en-US`, which is what this URL is pointing to.

    If you have your browser set up to prefer English content by default, then this is the URL you will be redirected to when you type in `developer.mozilla.org`. If you have your browser set up to prefer a different language that MDN supports, such as French, you will be redirected to a different URL, such as `https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/` instead. This isn't available to every website by default; the MDN developers have set MDN up like this to allow people to easily access the language they prefer.

> [!NOTE]
> There are a lot more components that can appear in URLs. See [What is a URL?](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_URL) for more details.

## Brief history of the web

In the late 1960s, the US military developed a communication network called [ARPANET](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Arpanet). This can be considered a forerunner of the **internet**, as it worked on [packet switching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching), and featured the first implementation of the [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) protocol suite. These two technologies form the basis of the infrastructure that the internet is built on.

In 1980, [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) (often referred to as TimBL) wrote a notebook program called ENQUIRE, which featured the concept of links between different nodes. Sound familiar?

Fast forward to 1989, and TimBL wrote [Information Management: A Proposal](https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html) and HyperText at CERN; these two publications together provided the background for how the web would work. They received a fair amount of interest, enough to convince TimBL's bosses to allow him to go ahead and create a global hypertext system.

By 1990-91, TimBL had created all the things needed to run the first version of the **World Wide Web** (generally referred to as the **web**) — [HTTP](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP), [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), the first web browser, which was called [WorldWideWeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldWideWeb), a web server, and some web pages to look at.

> [!NOTE]
> People sometimes use "the web" and "the internet" interchangeably, but they are different things. The internet is the infrastructure that enables information to be transported around the world between different servers and clients, whereas the web is a system built on top of the internet. The web defines types of information (content and code) that are transported via the internet and communications protocols to manage that transport.

In 1994, TimBL founded the [World Wide Web Consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium) (W3C), an organization that brings together representatives from many different companies to work together on the creation of web technologies. The W3C worked on standardizing and improving existing web technologies such as HTML and HTTP, and creating new technologies such as [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) and [JavaScript](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). CSS and JavaScript in particular were vital for giving the web styling and interactivity, making it look more like the web we know today.

In the next few years that followed, the web exploded, with multiple browsers being released, thousands of web servers being set up, and millions of web pages being created. Other standards organizations also appeared to help standardize different aspects of web technologies.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are interested in reading a more detailed account of web history, try searching for "history of the web" in your favorite [search engine](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Environment_setup/Browsing_the_web#search_engine) and see what you can find.

## Web standards

**Web standards** are the technologies we use to build websites. These standards exist as long technical documents called specifications, which detail exactly how the technology should work. These documents are not very useful for learning how to use the technologies they describe (this is why we have sites like MDN Web Docs). Instead, they are intended to be used by software engineers to implement these technologies (usually in web browsers).

### Standards bodies and processes

Web standards are created by standards bodies — institutions that invite groups of people from different technology companies to come together and agree on how the technologies should work in the best way to fulfill all of their use cases.

The W3C is the best known web standards body, but there are others. For example:

- [WHATWG](https://whatwg.org/) maintains the [HTML Living Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/), which describes exactly how HTML (all the HTML elements, and their associated APIs, and other surrounding technologies) should be implemented.
- [TC39](https://tc39.es/) and [ECMA](https://ecma-international.org/) specify and publish the standard for ECMAScript, which modern JavaScript is based on.
- [Khronos](https://www.khronos.org/) publish technologies for 3D graphics, such as WebGL.

The full processes by which standards are created can get deep and complex. However, unless you want to create your own web technology features, you don't need to understand most of it. If you want to contribute to the discussion around new technologies and provide feedback, it is usually a matter of joining the relevant mailing list or other discussion mechanism. Standards discussions are carried out in public, hence the term ["Open" standards](#open_standards).

For now, we'll give you a general, high-level understanding of how standards processes work:

1. Someone notices the need for a new web standard feature that will make developers' lives easier. For example, maybe there is a common pattern that is commonly used in web user interfaces, but it is a pain to implement. A dedicated CSS feature would make it much easier. The someone could be anyone — an individual developer, or an engineer working for a big tech company.
2. The person discusses this feature with other developers, browser engineers, etc., and starts to create interest in implementing the feature. Usually they write an explainer document that explains the need for the feature and how it will work, and a code demo that shows what the feature would look like in action.
3. If there is enough interest in the feature, it is formally discussed inside the relevant standards body working group. For example, CSS features are usually discussed by the [CSS Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/css/) (WG) (see also the [CSS Working Group Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_Working_Group) for a bit more description and history). Before a new web technology is accepted, it must be rigorously evaluated to make sure it is good for the web — for example, it doesn't introduce any security problems, it is [accessible and compatible](#accessible_and_interoperable) with other web technologies, and it doesn't rely on patents.
4. To prove out the feature, several things happen. These points can all happen around the same time as Point 3, or even before (browser vendors sometimes implement proprietary/non-standard features and then attempt to standardize them afterwards):
   1. One or more browser vendors will implement an experimental version of the new feature, often disabled by default, but which can be enabled by people who want to test it and provide feedback.
   2. A working group member will also add it to a technology specification so that browser vendors are able to implement it consistently.
   3. They will also seek out feedback from other browser vendors to see what issues they have with the proposal, and how likely they are to implement it. These are called Standards positions. See for example [Mozilla Standards Positions](https://mozilla.github.io/standards-positions/).
   4. Involved individuals will also write an extensive suite of tests to demonstrate that the feature works as described.

5. Eventually, if all is well, the feature will be implemented across all browsers and can start being used when creating websites.

> [!NOTE]
> It is perfectly possible that the people suggesting the feature, implementing it in a browser, creating the specification, writing tests, and collecting feedback on it, are the same person/people.

You can find more information on specific standards body processes. See for example:

- [W3C Process Document](https://www.w3.org/policies/process/)
- [WHATWG — Working Mode](https://whatwg.org/working-mode)
- [The TC39 Process](https://tc39.es/process-document/)

## Web standards key principles

The key principles of the web, which make the web a unique and exciting industry to get involved in, are as follows:

- Open to contribute and use, and therefore not patent-encumbered or controlled by a single private entity.
- Accessible and interoperable.
- They don't break the web.

Let's look at each of these in a little more detail.

### "Open" standards

One of the key aspects of web standards, which TimBL and the W3C agreed on from the start, is that the web (and web technologies) should be **open**. This means they are free to both contribute to and use, and not encumbered by patents/licensing. This is important — if a web technology relies on patented/licensed technologies to function, the patent/owner can then charge implementing browser vendors potentially large amounts of money, and those costs would then be passed on to the browser users.

In addition, because web technologies are created openly, in collaboration between many different companies, it means that no one company gets to control them, which is a really good thing. You wouldn't want a single company suddenly deciding to put the entire web behind a paywall, or releasing a new version of HTML that everyone has to buy to continue making websites, or worse still, deciding they aren't interested any more and just turning it off.

Open standards enable the web to remain a freely-available public resource, where anyone can write the code to build a website for free, and anyone can contribute to the standards creation process.

### Accessible and interoperable

The web and web browsers are fundamentally designed so that web content is **accessible** to people with disabilities. It was originally envisaged as a great leveller, enabling people to access information regardless of circumstance. This means that, for example:

- People who are unable to use a mouse or pointing device can use the keyboard to navigate the web.
- People who are visually impaired can magnify content, or use a program called a **screen reader** to read content out to them and describe controls in a way that makes sense.

> [!NOTE]
> You'll learn more about [Accessibility](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility) later on in the learning pathway.

In addition, web technologies are intended to be **interoperable**. Because web technologies are implemented according to published standards, browsers should provide the same rendered output for a given input (for example, HTML, CSS, or JS code) — in other words, a website should work consistently across multiple browsers.

### Don't break the web

Another phrase you'll hear around open web standards is "don't break the web". The idea behind this is that any new web technology should be backwards compatible with what went before it, so existing websites will continue to work in the same way as they did before.

Web browser vendors should be able to implement new web technologies without causing a difference in rendering or functionality that would cause their users to think a website is broken and try another browser as a result.

## Overview of modern web technologies

There are a number of technologies to learn if you want to be a front-end web developer. In this section we will describe them briefly.

### HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

[HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), and [JavaScript](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) are the main three technologies you'll use to build a website. You met these in the [previous module](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website), but, to recap:

- HyperText Markup Language, or **HTML**, is a markup language consisting of different elements you can wrap (mark up) content in to give it meaning (semantics) and structure. If we adopted a house-building analogy, HTML would be like the foundations and walls of the house, which give it structure and hold it together.
- Cascading Style Sheets (**CSS**) is a rule-based language used to apply styles to your HTML — for example, setting text and background colors, adding borders, animating things, or laying out a page in a certain way. In the house analogy, CSS is like the paint, wallpaper, carpets and paintings you'd use to make the house look nice.
- **JavaScript** is the programming language we use to add interactivity to websites, from dynamic style switching, to fetching updates from the server, right through to complex 3D graphics.
  - You'll also hear the term **API** along with JavaScript, which stands for **Application Programming Interface**. A JavaScript API is functionality built on top of JavaScript that allows you to control other more complex bits of code or other functionality on your computer (such as hardware devices like your webcam or microphone) in a manageable way.
  - In the house analogy, JavaScript is like the cooker, TV, Microwave, or hairdryer — the things that give your house useful functionality.

### Other web technologies

There are other technologies used on the web, for example:

- [HTTP](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) for communicating between clients and servers, as mentioned earlier.
- [SVG](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) for creating and manipulating vector graphics.
- [MathML](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML) for describing mathematical formulae.

However, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by far the most important technologies to learn, so we will focus mainly on those in our learning pathway.

## Tools

Once you've learned about the standard, foundational technologies used to build web pages (such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), you'll soon start to come across various tools that can be used to make your work easier or more efficient. Examples include:

- [Developer tools](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools) inside modern browsers that can be used to debug your code.
- [Testing tools](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Testing) that can be used to run tests to show whether your code is behaving as you intended it to.
- [Frameworks and libraries](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Frameworks_libraries) built on top of JavaScript that allow you to build certain types of website much more quickly and effectively.
- So-called **Linters** and **formatters**, which take a set of rules for coding style, look at your code, and update your code to follow those rules. Prettier, which you [met earlier in the course](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Environment_setup/Code_editors#enhancing_your_code_editor_with_extensions), is an example of a formatter.

## Server-side languages and frameworks

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are front-end (or client-side) languages, which means they are run by the browser to produce a website front-end that your users can use.

There is another class of languages called back-end (or server-side) languages, meaning that they are run on the server before the result is then sent to the browser to be displayed. A typical use for a server-side language is to get some data out of a database, generate some HTML to contain the data, then send the HTML over to the browser to display it to the user.

Example server-side frameworks and languages include ASP.NET (C#), Django (Python), Laravel (PHP), and Next.js (JavaScript).

These technologies are not considered to be "web standards" — they are developed by organizations outside the web standards processes of organizations such as the W3C and WHATWG — although some of them will have processes that are similarly open.

### Static versus dynamic

Another way that client-side and server-side languages are often described is **static** and **dynamic**:

- A plain HTML file is stored on the server. When requested, it is delivered to the client, unchanged, and rendered by the browser. Because it does not change, it is referred to as "static".
- When server-side code (for example, a Python script or an ASP.NET page) generates some HTML containing data and returns that HTML to the client, the contents of the HTML change depending on what the server-side code does. It is therefore referred to as "dynamic".

There is often a bit of overlap between the concepts of static and dynamic code. Server-side languages usually define HTML structures inside a template file, which tend to be mostly static HTML with some special dynamic sections included that change depending on what data needs to be inserted.

## Web best practices

We have briefly talked about the technologies that you'll use to build websites. Now let's discuss the best practices that web developers generally employ to ensure that their websites are usable by as many people as possible.

When doing web development, the main cause of uncertainty comes from the fact that you don't know what combination of technology each user will use to view your website:

- User 1 might be looking at it on an iPhone, with a small, narrow screen.
- User 2 might be looking at it on a Windows laptop with a widescreen monitor attached to it.
- User 3 might be visually impaired, and using a screen reader to read and interact with the web page.
- User 4 might be using a really old desktop machine that can't run modern browsers.

Because you don't know exactly what your users will use, you need to design defensively — make your website as flexible as possible, so that all of the above users can make use of it, even if they might not all get the same experience.

You'll come across the below concepts at some point in your studies, which represent best practices your websites should ideally adhere to. Don't worry about these too much for now. Throughout most of the course we try to teach these implicitly, meaning that when we teach you HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, our examples will follow the best practices where possible. Later on in your learning journey you will likely explore explicit teachings in these areas.

- **Progressive enhancement**
  - : Creating a minimal experience that provides the essential functionality to all users, and layering on a better experience and other enhancements in browsers that can support them. Progressive enhancement is often seen as unimportant, because browsers tend to support new features more consistently these days, and people tend to have faster internet connections with higher limits on data usage. However, consider examples like cutting down on decoration to make a mobile experience smoother and save on data or providing a lighter, low-bandwidth experience for users who pay by the megabyte or have metered connections.
- **Cross-browser compatibility**
  - : Trying to make sure your webpage works across as many devices as possible. This includes using technologies that all the browsers support, delivering better experiences to browsers that can handle them (progressive enhancement), and/or writing code so that it falls back to a simpler but still usable experience in older browsers (termed **graceful degradation**). It also requires testing to see if anything fails in certain browsers, and then more work to fix those failures.
- **Separating the layers**
  - : Putting your content (HTML), styling (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript) in different code files, rather than lumping them all together in the same place. This is a good idea for many reasons, including code management and comprehension and teamwork/separation of roles. In reality, the separation is not always clear. It is an ideal to aim for where possible, rather than an absolute.
- **Responsive web design**
  - : Making your functionality and layouts flexible so they can automatically adapt to different browsers. An obvious example is a website that is laid out one way in a widescreen browser on the desktop, but displays as a more compact, single-column layout on mobile phone browsers. Try adjusting the width of your browser window now, and see what happens to the site layout.
- **Performance**
  - : Getting websites to load as quickly as possible, but also making them intuitive and easy to use so that users don't get frustrated and go somewhere else.
- **Internationalization**
  - : Making websites usable by people from different cultures, who speak different languages to your own. There are technical considerations here (such as altering your layout so that it still works OK for right-to-left or top-to-bottom languages), and human ones (such as using simple, non-slang language so that diverse cultures are more likely to understand your text).
- **Privacy** & **Security**
  - : These two concepts are related but different. Privacy refers to allowing people to go about their business privately and not spying on them or collecting more of their data than you absolutely need to. Security refers to constructing your website in a secure way so that malicious users cannot steal information contained on it from you or your users.

# JavaScript: Adding interactivity

{{PreviousMenuNext("Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website/Styling_the_content", "Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website/Publishing_your_website", "Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website")}}

JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to websites. You can use it to control just about anything — form data validation, button functionality, game logic, dynamic styling, animation updates, and much more. This article gets you started with JavaScript and walks you through adding some fun features to your first website.

## What is JavaScript?

{{Glossary("JavaScript")}} is a full-fledged programming language — it contains all the classic programming features you may have seen in other programming languages (or at least heard about), such as **variables**, **loops**, and **functions**.

JavaScript, when used on web pages (though it can also be used in other places), generally works by:

- Getting references to one or more values such as numbers or to elements on the page.
- Doing something with those values, such as adding the numbers together.
- Returning a result that can be used to do something else later on. For example, you might want to display the sum of those numbers on the page.

Let's look at an example. We'll use the same basic list we saw in the last couple of articles:

```html live-sample___basic-js
<p>Instructions for life:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Eat</li>
  <li>Sleep</li>
  <li>Repeat</li>
</ul>
```

We'll also define a CSS class called `.done` that will style any element it's applied to, making it look like a completed task with green text color and a strikethrough. We'll apply it to our `<li>` elements using JavaScript in the next step.

```css live-sample___basic-js
.done {
  color: darkseagreen;
  text-decoration: line-through solid black 2px;
}
```

Now on to the JavaScript. Here, we first store references to the `<li>` elements inside a variable called `listItems`. We then define a function called `toggleDone()` that adds the `done` class to a list item if it doesn't already have it, and removes the class if it does. Finally, we loop through the list items (using `forEach()`) and add an event listener (using `addEventListener()`) to each list item so that when it is clicked, the `done` class is toggled, applying the CSS we defined earlier.

```js live-sample___basic-js
const listItems = document.querySelectorAll("li");

function toggleDone(e) {
  if (!e.target.className) {
    e.target.className = "done";
  } else {
    e.target.className = "";
  }
}

listItems.forEach((item) => {
  item.addEventListener("click", toggleDone);
});
```

Don't worry if you don't understand the above JavaScript now. Getting comfortable with JavaScript is more challenging than getting comfortable with HTML and CSS, but things will become clearer later on in the course.

This example will render as follows in a web browser:

{{EmbedLiveSample("basic-js", "100%", "140px")}}

Try clicking the list items a few times and note how the "done" styles are toggled on and off as a result. Not that bad for 11 lines of JavaScript.

## A "Hello world!" walkthrough

To start you off with writing some JavaScript, we'll walk you through adding a _Hello world!_ example to your sample website. ([_Hello world!_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) is the standard introductory programming example.)

> [!WARNING]
> If you haven't been following along with the rest of our course, [download this example code](https://github.com/mdn/beginner-html-site-styled/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and use it as a starting point.

1. Inside your `first-website` folder or the example folder you have just downloaded, create a new folder named `scripts`.
2. Within the `scripts` folder, create a new text document called `main.js`, and save it.
3. Go to your `index.html` file and enter this code on a new line, just before the closing `</head>` tag:

   ```html
   <script async src="scripts/main.js"></script>
   ```

   This does the same job as the {{htmlelement("link")}} element for CSS – it applies the JavaScript to the page so it can affect the HTML (along with the CSS and anything else on the page).

4. Add this code to your `scripts/main.js` file:

   ```js
   // Store a reference to the <h1> in a variable
   const myHeading = document.querySelector("h1");
   // Update the text content of the <h1>
   myHeading.textContent = "Hello world!";
   ```

5. Make sure the HTML and JavaScript files are saved, then load `index.html` in your browser. You should see something like this:

![Heading "hello world" above a firefox logo](hello-world.png)

Let's break down how this example works.

We used JavaScript to change the heading text to `Hello world!`. We grabbed a reference to the heading and stored it in a variable called `myHeading` (a container that stores a value). This is similar to how you apply CSS to elements – you first select the elements you want to affect using a CSS selector, and then define the styles you want for those elements. In both cases, when you want to do something to an element, you need to select it first.

Following that, we set the value of the `myHeading` variable's `textContent` property (which represents the `<h1>` element's text content) to _Hello world!_.

The lines that start with `//` are JavaScript comments. In the same way as HTML and CSS comments, the browser ignores these, providing a way for you to add notes about your code to help explain how it works.

Let's move on and add some new features to our example site.

> [!WARNING]
> Before going any further, delete the "Hello world!" code from your `main.js` file. If you don't, the existing code will clash with the new code you are about to add.

## Adding an image changer

In this section, you will use JavaScript and [DOM API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_DOM_API) features to alternate the display between two images. This change will happen when a user clicks the displayed image.

1. Choose another image to feature on your example site. Ideally, the image should be the same size as the one you added previously, or as close as possible.
2. Save this image in your `images` folder.
3. Add the following JavaScript code to your `main.js` file, making sure to replace `firefox2.png` and both instances of `firefox-icon.png` with your second and first image names, respectively.

   ```js
   const myImage = document.querySelector("img");

   myImage.addEventListener("click", () => {
     const mySrc = myImage.getAttribute("src");
     if (mySrc === "images/firefox-icon.png") {
       myImage.setAttribute("src", "images/firefox2.png");
     } else {
       myImage.setAttribute("src", "images/firefox-icon.png");
     }
   });
   ```

4. Save all files and load `index.html` in the browser. Now when you click the image, it should change to the other one.

In this code, you stored a reference to your {{htmlelement("img")}} element in the `myImage` variable. Then you assigned it a `click` event handler function. Every time the `<img>` is clicked, the function does the following:

- Retrieves the value of the image's `src` attribute.
- Uses a conditional (`if...else` structure) to check if the `src` value is equal to the path of the original image:
  - If it is, the code changes the `src` value to the path of the second image, forcing the other image to be loaded inside the `<img>` element.
  - If it isn't (meaning the image has already been changed), the `src` value swaps back to the original image path.

> [!NOTE]
> This section introduces several important terms. Key concepts include:
>
> - [API](/en-US/docs/Glossary/API): A set of features that allows a developer to interact with a programming environment. Web APIs (such as the DOM API features we used above) are built on top of the JavaScript language and allow you to manipulate various parts of the browser and the web pages it displays.
> - [Events](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Events): Things that happen in the browser. They're key to making websites interactive. You can run code in response to events using **event handler functions** – these are code blocks that run when an event occurs. The most common example is the [click event](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event), which is fired by the browser when a user clicks on something.
> - [Functions](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Functions): A way of packaging code that you wish to reuse. You can define your code inside a function once and then run it as many times as you like, which helps you avoid writing the same code over and over. In our example here, we defined a `click` event handler function, which runs every time a user clicks the image.
> - [Conditionals](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Conditionals): Code structures used to test if an expression returns `true` or `false` and run different code in response to each result. A very common form of conditionals is the `if...else` statement.

## Adding a personalized welcome message

Next, let's change the page heading to show a personalized welcome message when the user first visits the site. This welcome message will be saved in the browser using the [Web Storage API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API), so if the user leaves the site and returns later, their personalized data will still be there. We'll also include a way for the user to change the message.

1. In `index.html`, add the following line just before the closing `</body>` tag:

   ```html
   <button>Change user</button>
   ```

2. In `main.js`, place the following code at the bottom of the file, exactly as it is written. This creates references to the new button and the heading, storing each inside variables:

   ```js
   let myButton = document.querySelector("button");
   let myHeading = document.querySelector("h1");
   ```

3. Add the following function to set the personalized greeting. This won't do anything yet; we will call the function later on.

   ```js
   function setUserName() {
     const myName = prompt("Please enter your name.");
     localStorage.setItem("name", myName);
     myHeading.textContent = `Mozilla is cool, ${myName}`;
   }
   ```

   The `setUserName()` function contains a [`prompt()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt) function, which asks the user to enter data and stores it in a variable after they click _OK_. In this example, we're asking the user to enter a name and storing it in `myName`.<br /><br />

   Next, the code uses the [Web Storage API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API), which allows us to store data in the browser and retrieve it later. We use the {{domxref("Storage.setItem", "localStorage.setItem()")}} function to create and store a data item called `"name"`, setting its value to the `myName` variable, which contains the user's input.<br /><br />

   Finally, we set the `textContent` of the heading to a string that includes the user's stored name.

4. Add the following conditional block after the function declaration. This is our _initialization code_ — it runs when the page first loads to start the program off:

   ```js
   if (!localStorage.getItem("name")) {
     setUserName();
   } else {
     const storedName = localStorage.getItem("name");
     myHeading.textContent = `Mozilla is cool, ${storedName}`;
   }
   ```

   The first line of this block uses the negation operator (logical NOT, represented by the `!` character) to check whether the `name` data item is _not_ already stored in `localStorage`. If not, the `setUserName()` function runs to create it. If it exists (that is, the user set a username during a previous visit), we retrieve the stored name using {{domxref("Storage.getItem", "localStorage.getItem()")}} and set the `textContent` of the heading to a string, plus the user's name – just like we did inside `setUserName()`.

5. Add a `click` event handler function to the button. When clicked, `setUserName()` runs. This allows the user to store a different name if they want to.

   ```js
   myButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
     setUserName();
   });
   ```

6. Save all files and load `index.html` in the browser. You should immediately be asked to enter your name. After you do so, it will appear inside the `<h1>` as part of the personalized greeting. Notice how the personalization persists even after you reload the page. You can click the "Change user" button to enter a new name.

> [!NOTE]
> The term [operator](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Math) refers to a JavaScript language character that carries out an operation on one or more values. Examples include `+` (adds values), `-` (subtracts one value from another), and `!` (negates a value — as you saw earlier).

## A user name of null?

When you run the example and get the dialog box that prompts you to enter your name, try pressing the _Cancel_ button. You should end up with a title that reads _Mozilla is cool, null_. This happens because the value is set to [`null`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/null) when you cancel the prompt. In JavaScript, _null_ is a special value that represents the absence of a value.

Also, try clicking _OK_ without entering a name. You should end up with a title that reads _Mozilla is cool,_ because you've set `myName` to an empty string.

To avoid these problems, you can add another conditional to check that the user hasn't entered a blank name. Update your `setUserName()` function to the following:

```js
function setUserName() {
  const myName = prompt("Please enter your name.");
  if (!myName) {
    setUserName();
  } else {
    localStorage.setItem("name", myName);
    myHeading.textContent = `Mozilla is cool, ${myName}`;
  }
}
```

In human language, this means: If `myName` has no value, run `setUserName()` again from the start. If it does have a value (if the above statement is not true), then store the value in `localStorage` and set it as the heading's text.

## Conclusion

If you have followed all the instructions in this article, you should end up with a page that looks something like the image below. You can also [view our version](https://mdn.github.io/beginner-html-site-scripted/).

HTML (**H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. This article provides a basic understanding of HTML and its functionality, and shows you how to create the basic content for your first website.

## So what is HTML?

HTML is a _markup language_ consisting of a series of **{{Glossary("element", "elements")}}** used to wrap (or enclose) text content to define its structure and cause it to behave in a certain way.

Let's look at an example — the following content will all be shown on the same line when displayed on a web page, as it is not structured in any way:

```plain
Instructions for life:
Eat
Sleep
Repeat
```

If we wrap this content with the following HTML elements, we can turn that single line into a paragraph ({{htmlelement("p")}}) and three bullet points ({{htmlelement("li")}}):

```html live-sample___basic-html
<p>Instructions for life:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Eat</li>
  <li>Sleep</li>
  <li>Repeat</li>
</ul>
```

This HTML will render as follows in a web browser:

{{EmbedLiveSample("basic-html", "100%", "140px")}}

As well as structuring text, HTML has many other uses — making text or images link to other web pages, embedding images or videos, creating data tables, and so on.

## Creating your first HTML document

Let's see how individual elements are combined to form an HTML page. In this section, you'll create a basic HTML file and take a look at what it's made up of.

1. Inside your `web-projects` folder, create another new folder called `first-website`.
2. Inside `first-website`, create a new file called `index.html`, and insert the following code into the file exactly as shown:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="" alt="My test image" />
  </body>
</html>
```

Here, we have the following:

- `<!doctype html>`: The [doctype](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Doctype) is a required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However, these days, they don't do much and are basically just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for now.
- `<html></html>`: The {{htmlelement("html")}} element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the **root element**. It also includes the `lang` [attribute](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Attribute), which sets the primary language of the document.
- `<head></head>`: The {{htmlelement("head")}} element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that _isn't_ the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like {{Glossary("keyword", "keywords")}} and a page description that you want to appear in search results, {{glossary("CSS")}} to style the content, character set declarations, and more.
- `<meta charset="utf-8">`: This element sets the character set your document should use to [UTF-8](/en-US/docs/Glossary/UTF-8), which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later on.
- `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">`: This [viewport element](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSSOM_view/Viewport_concepts#mobile_viewports) ensures the page renders at the width of the browser viewport, preventing mobile browsers from rendering pages wider than the viewport and then shrinking them down.
- `<title></title>`: The {{htmlelement("title")}} element sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.
- `<body></body>`: The {{htmlelement("body")}} element contains _all_ the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else. At the moment it only contains a single `<img>` element, but we'll add more content later on.

> [!NOTE]
> Most HTML elements consist of an **opening tag** (for example, `<body>`), followed by the element's content, followed by a **closing tag** (for example, `</body>`). Some HTML elements also have **attributes**, which contain extra settings or information about the element — see for example `charset`, `name`, and `src` in the our code sample.

## Embedding images

Let's turn our attention to the {{htmlelement("img")}} element:

```html
<img src="" alt="My test image" />
```

This embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via the `src` (source) attribute, which contains the path to the image file we want to embed.

We have also included an `alt` (alternative) attribute. In the [`alt` attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/img#authoring_meaningful_alternate_descriptions), you specify descriptive text for users who cannot see the image, possibly because of the following reasons:

1. They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual impairments often use tools called screen readers to read out the alt text to them.
2. Something has gone wrong, causing the image not to display. If the `src` attribute does not contain a valid path to an image, the alt text will be displayed instead:

   ![The words: my test image](alt-text-example.png)

The alt text you write should provide the reader with enough information to have a good idea of what the image conveys. In this example, our current text of "My test image" is not good because it doesn't convey descriptive information about the image. A much better alternative for our Firefox logo would be "The Firefox logo: a flaming fox surrounding the Earth."

> Elements such as `<img>` have no content or closing tag, and are therefore called **empty** (or **{{glossary("void element", "void")}}**) elements. They are sometimes written with a **trailing slash** at the end of their single tag (`<img />`), but this is optional.

Let's get your image displaying now.

1. Inside the `first-website` folder, create a new folder called `images`, and put the image you chose in the previous example inside this folder.
2. Inside the `<img>` tag's `src` attribute value, enter the path to your image. It is inside a folder called `images`, which is inside the same directory as your `index.html` file, therefore the path will be `images/` plus the name of your image. For example, if your image was called `firefox-icon.png`, your `src` attribute would look like this: `src="images/firefox-icon.png"`.
3. Replace the `alt` attribute value — `My test image` — with some text that better describes your image.
4. Open your `index.html` file inside a web browser. You should see your image displayed. If not, check your `<img>` element against our code; make sure it is not missing any of the syntax, such as the quote marks. Make sure the image filename is correct.

If the image is really large and therefore doesn't fit on the screen, don't worry about it. We'll fix this issue in the next article.

> [!NOTE]
> Find out more about using an `alt` attribute for images in various situations in our [accessible multimedia tutorial](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/Multimedia) and [An alt Decision Tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/).

## Marking up text

This section will cover some essential HTML elements you'll use for marking up text.

> [!NOTE]
> Scrimba's [The basics of semantic HTML](https://scrimba.com/the-frontend-developer-career-path-c0j/~0xid?via=mdn) <sup>[_MDN learning partner_](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Learning_content#partner_links_and_embeds)</sup> is an interactive lesson providing a useful description of HTML, with particular emphasis on why the _semantic_ aspect of it is important.

### Headings

Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or subheadings. In the same way that a book has the main title, chapter titles, and subtitles, an HTML document can too. HTML contains 6 heading levels, {{htmlelement("Heading_Elements", "&lt;h1&gt;–&lt;h6&gt;")}}, although you'll commonly only use 3 to 4 at most:

```html
<!-- 4 heading levels: -->
<h1>My main title</h1>
<h2>My top level heading</h2>
<h3>My subheading</h3>
<h4>My sub-subheading</h4>
```

> [!NOTE]
> Anything in HTML between `<!--` and `-->` is an **HTML comment**. The browser ignores comments as it renders the code. In other words, they are not visible on the page — just in the code. HTML comments are a way for you to add notes about your code or logic, which might be useful to others working on the same code, or you, if you came back to it after 6 months and can't remember what you did.

Add your page title to the HTML page just above your {{htmlelement("img")}} element, wrapped inside `<h1> ... </h1>` tags. Save the file and view it in a browser to see the effect.

### Paragraphs

Paragraph {{htmlelement("p")}} elements are for containing paragraphs of text; you'll use these frequently when marking up regular text content:

```html
<p>This is a single paragraph</p>
```

Add your sample text from the previous article into one or a few paragraphs, placed directly below your {{htmlelement("img")}} element. Save it and look at your page in a browser.

### Lists

A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always consists of at least 2 elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:

1. **Unordered lists** are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a {{htmlelement("ul")}} element.
2. **Ordered lists** are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a list of cooking instructions in a recipe. These are wrapped in an {{htmlelement("ol")}} element.

Each item inside the lists is put inside an {{htmlelement("li")}} (list item) element.

For example, if we wanted to turn part of the following paragraph fragment into a list:

```html
<p>
  At Mozilla, we're a global community of technologists, thinkers, and builders
  working together…
</p>
```

We could modify the markup to this:

```html
<p>At Mozilla, we're a global community of</p>

<ul>
  <li>technologists</li>
  <li>thinkers</li>
  <li>builders</li>
</ul>

<p>working together…</p>
```

Try adding an ordered or unordered list to your example page, and view the result in a browser.

## Creating links

Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! To add a link, we need to use an {{htmlelement("a")}} element, "a" being short for "anchor". To make text within your paragraph into a link, follow these steps:

1. Choose some text. We chose the text "Mozilla Manifesto".
2. Wrap the text in an {{htmlelement("a")}} element, as shown below:

   ```html
   <a>Mozilla Manifesto</a>
   ```

3. Give the {{htmlelement("a")}} element an `href` attribute, as shown below:

   ```html
   <a href="">Mozilla Manifesto</a>
   ```

4. Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you want the link to point to:

   ```html
   <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">
     Mozilla Manifesto
   </a>
   ```

You might get unexpected results if you omit the `https://` or `http://` part, called the _protocol_, at the beginning of the web address. After making a link, click it to make sure it is sending you where you wanted it to.

> [!NOTE]
> `href` might appear like a rather obscure choice for an attribute name at first. It stands for _**h**ypertext **ref**erence_.

Add a link to your page now, if you haven't already done so.

## Conclusion

This module introduces you to the practicalities of web development. You'll gather the assets and write the code to construct a simple webpage, then publish it for the world to see.

It's a lot of work to create a professional website, so if you're new to web development, we encourage you to start small. You won't build another Facebook right away, but it's not hard to make your own simple website online, so we'll start there.

## Prerequisites

This module assumes no prior knowledge of web technologies, but you should already be comfortable with using your operating system, including using the file system and browsing the web. You should have a code editor and multiple web browsers installed.

If this is not the case, we'd suggest that you run through the [Environment setup](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Environment_setup) module first.

## What are the options?

Publishing a website is a complex topic because there are many ways to go about it. This article doesn't attempt to document all the possible methods. Instead, it explains the advantages and disadvantages of three approaches that are practical for beginners. Then it steps through one method that can work right away for many readers.

### Getting hosting and a domain name

To have more control over content and website appearance, most professionals/businesses choose to buy web hosting and a domain name:

- Web hosting is rented file space on a hosting company's [web server](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_web_server). You put website files on the web server. The web server provides website content to website visitors.
- A [domain name](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_domain_name) is the unique web address where people find your website, such as `https://www.mozilla.org` or `https://www.bbc.co.uk`. You can rent your domain name for as many years as you want from a **domain registrar**.

If you get your web hosting _and_ domain name from the same company, they tend to be configured automatically to talk to one another. However, If you get them from separate companies, or want to change your hosting to a different company, you need to do a bit of setup to point the domain name to the correct server. This is so that people will see your website when they navigate to that web address. This is usually done by logging into your domain registrar's website, and setting your domain's [nameservers](https://kinsta.com/blog/what-is-a-nameserver/) to the ones provided by your hosting company.

Companies use various mechanisms to transfer files to their web servers. Many will have more than one option; typical options include:

- A drag and drop interface (you'll see an example of this in [Publishing via GitHub](#publishing_via_github), later on).
- An {{Glossary("FTP", "File Transfer Protocol (FTP)")}} program. FTP programs vary widely, but generally, you have to connect to your web server using details provided by your hosting company (typically username, password, hostname). Then the program shows you your local files and the web server's files in two windows, and provides a way for you to transfer files back and forth.
- Keeping website source code in a GitHub repo (see below) and granting the hosting company access so they can fetch the source, build it if necessary, and publish it.
- Some companies will provide [command line tools](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Environment_setup/Command_line) for you to use to transfer your files.

#### Tips for finding hosting and domains

- MDN does not promote specific commercial hosting companies or domain name registrars. To find hosting companies and registrars, just search for "web hosting" and "domain names". All registrars will have a feature to allow you to check if the domain name you want is available.
- Your home or office {{Glossary("ISP", "internet service provider")}} may provide some limited hosting for a small website. The available feature set will be limited, but it might be perfect for your first experiments.
- There are also free services available like [Neocities](https://neocities.org/), [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/), and [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/). Such services can be limited in scope, but they are good enough for initial experiments.

### Using an online tool

Some tools let you publish your website online:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a "social coding" site. It allows you to upload code repositories for storage in the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) **version control system.** You can then collaborate on code projects, and the system is open-source by default, meaning that anyone in the world can find your GitHub code, use it, learn from it, and improve on it. GitHub has a very useful feature called [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which allows you to expose website code live on the web.
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is a web hosting platform that provides hosting for static websites directly from your GitHub repository. It also provides a number of additional features, such as deployment preview, serverless functions, and form handling.
- [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) is a platform that allows you to deploy applications and databases close to your users. This is more suitable if you have a web application that requires backend services.

These options are generally free, with a limited feature-set.

### Using a web-based IDE such as CodePen

There are a number of web apps that emulate a website development environment, allowing you to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which is then rendered and displayed in an output pane. Generally speaking, these tools are easy to use, great for learning, good for sharing code (for example, if you want to share a technique with or ask for debugging help from colleagues in a different office), and free (for basic features). They host your rendered page at a unique web address. However, the features are limited, and these apps often don't provide hosting space for assets (like images).

Try playing with some of these examples to find out which one works best for you:

- [JSBin](https://jsbin.com/)
- [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)

## Publishing via GitHub

Now let's examine how to publish your site via GitHub Pages.

1. First of all, [sign up for GitHub](https://github.com/) and verify your email address.
2. Next, you need to [create a repository](https://github.com/new) to store files. On this page:
   1. in the _Repository name_ box, enter _username_.github.io, where _username_ is your username. For example, our friend Bob Smith would enter _bobsmith.github.io_.
   2. Click the _Create repository_ button at the bottom of the page.
3. On the next page, find the _uploading an existing file_ link, and click on it. This should bring you to the file upload page.
4. At this point, you should be able to drag and drop files from your local file system onto the web page to upload them to the GitHub repository. To do so:
   1. Open a file explorer/finder window on your computer.
   2. Make sure you can see the file explorer _and_ the web browser windows — position them next to one another on your screen.
   3. Navigate the file explorer window to the folder containing your sample website.
      > [!NOTE]
      > Make sure your folder has an `index.html` file.
   4. Select all of your sample website's files (for example using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> keyboard shortcut, or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> on macOS).
   5. Drag the files from your file explorer over the "Drag files here to add them to your repository" section of the GitHub page.
   6. The section's border and text changes to indicate a drop is possible. Drop the files at this point.
   7. Click the _Commit changes_ button at the bottom of the page.
5. Navigate your browser to _username_.github.io to see your website online. For example, for the username _chrisdavidmills_, go to [_chrisdavidmills_.github.io](https://chrisdavidmills.github.io/).

   > [!NOTE]
   > It may take a few minutes for your website to go live. If your website does not display immediately, wait a few minutes and try again.

# CSS: Styling the content

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. This article walks you through a basic understanding of CSS — how it works and how to improve the look and feel of the content structure you created in the previous article.

## What is CSS?

Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. **CSS is a style sheet language.** CSS is used to style HTML elements: you select the elements you want to style and set values for their style properties, which define how they will look.

Let's revisit the basic HTML example from the article [Creating the content](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website/Creating_the_content):

```html live-sample___basic-html live-sample___basic-css
<p>Instructions for life:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Eat</li>
  <li>Sleep</li>
  <li>Repeat</li>
</ul>
```

This renders as follows on its own:

{{EmbedLiveSample("basic-html", "100%", "140px")}}

If we add some CSS into the mix, we can change how the HTML looks. The following snippet selects the {{htmlelement("p")}} element and gives it a different [font](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family) and a red text {{cssxref("color")}}. It then selects all the {{htmlelement("li")}} elements and gives each one a greeny-yellow {{cssxref("background-color")}}, a 1-pixel solid black {{cssxref("border")}}, and a 5-pixel [bottom margin](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-bottom):

```css live-sample___basic-css
p {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  color: red;
}

li {
  background-color: greenyellow;
  border: 1px solid black;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
}
```

With the CSS applied to the HTML, the demo now renders like this:

{{EmbedLiveSample("basic-css", "100%", "160px")}}

As you can see, with just a little CSS, we were able to change the appearance of a plain-looking list.

CSS has many other functions, from specifying background images and gradients, to controlling typography and scrolling behavior, to adding animations and building entire web page layouts.

## Applying CSS to your HTML

When using CSS, the first thing to get right is to make sure that your CSS is successfully applied to your HTML. In this section, we'll add a CSS **stylesheet** to your `first-website` and apply it to your page.

1. Inside your `first-website` folder, create another new folder called `styles`.
2. Using a text editor, paste the following CSS into a new file, which will give your `<p>` elements a red text color. It's useful to start with something like this to test whether your stylesheet is being applied to your HTML correctly.

   ```css
   p {
     color: red;
   }
   ```

3. Save the file in the `styles` folder with the filename `style.css`.
4. Open your `index.html` file. Paste the following line inside the HTML head (between the {{HTMLElement("head")}} and `</head>` tags):

   ```html
   <link href="styles/style.css" rel="stylesheet" />
   ```

5. Save `index.html` and load it in your browser. You should see something like this:

![A Mozilla logo and some paragraphs. The paragraph text has been styled red by our css.](website-screenshot-styled.png)

If your paragraph text is red, congratulations! Your CSS is working. If not, go through the above steps and check carefully that you have followed each one correctly.

## CSS syntax basics

In the previous CSS example, `p` is called a **selector** — it selects the element(s) to style. In particular, `p` selects all the paragraphs in the HTML. The line inside the curly braces (`{ }`) is called a **declaration** – it sets a value for a specific property. In this case, the **property** is `color`, which controls the text color of the paragraphs, and the **property value** set is `red`.

The whole structure is called a **ruleset**. (The term _ruleset_ is often referred to as just _rule_.)

Let's look at another ruleset, this time with multiple declarations:

```css
p {
  color: red;
  width: 500px;
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```

Within a ruleset, you must use a semicolon (`;`) to separate one declaration from the next. Within each declaration, you must use a colon (`:`) to separate the property and its value.

You can also include multiple selectors in one rule, separated by commas, to select multiple elements. For example:

```css
p,
.my-class,
#my-id {
  color: red;
}
```

In this CSS rule, we've included an **element** (or **type**) selector, which selects a specific HTML element. We've also included two other selector types, which aren't relevant to the rest of this tutorial. If you're curious about what they do, check out our [Basic selectors](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Basic_selectors) guide.

> [!NOTE]
> Scrimba's [Write your first lines of CSS!](https://scrimba.com/the-frontend-developer-career-path-c0j/~015?via=mdn) <sup>[_MDN learning partner_](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Learning_content#partner_links_and_embeds)</sup> provides a useful interactive introduction to CSS syntax.

## Improving the text

Let's return to our example and use CSS to improve the appearance of the text. We'll set a new font for the page and change some text settings for different elements.

1. First, find the [output from Google Fonts](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website/What_will_your_website_look_like#choosing_a_font) that you previously saved. If you've not already chosen a font, follow the link and do it now.
2. Add the {{htmlelement("link")}} elements inside your `index.html`'s {{HTMLElement("head")}}, just before the closing `</head>` tag. They should look something like this:

   ```html
   <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
   <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin />
   <link
     href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,100..900;1,100..900&display=swap"
     rel="stylesheet" />
   ```

   This code links your page to a stylesheet hosted by the Google Fonts service, which loads your chosen font.

3. Next, go to your `style.css` file and delete the existing rule. We no longer want our paragraphs to be red.
4. Add the following lines to `style.css`:

   ```css
   html {
     /* px means "pixels". The base font size is now 10 pixels high */
     font-size: 10px;
     /* Replace PLACEHOLDER with the font-family property value you got from Google Fonts */
     font-family: PLACEHOLDER;
   }
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > Anything in CSS between `/*` and `*/` is a **CSS comment**, which is ignored by the browser. CSS comments are a way for you to include helpful notes about your code or logic, without affecting how your webpage is rendered.

5. Replace the `font-family` placeholder line with the `font-family` line from your Google Fonts code, for example:

   ```css
   font-family: "Roboto", sans-serif;
   ```

   The `font-family` property sets the font(s) you want to apply to your HTML. This rule defines a global base font and font size for the whole page. All elements inside the {{HTMLElement("html")}} element will inherit the same `font-size` and `font-family`.

6. Now let's set some font and text styles on our [`<h1>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/Heading_Elements), {{htmlelement("li")}}, and {{htmlelement("p")}} elements. We'll set new {{cssxref("font-size")}} values for each element. We'll also center the heading using {{cssxref("text-align")}} and increase the {{cssxref("line-height")}} and {{cssxref("letter-spacing")}} of the paragraphs and list items to make the body content more readable.

   ```css
   h1 {
     font-size: 60px;
     text-align: center;
   }

   p,
   li {
     font-size: 16px;
     line-height: 2;
     letter-spacing: 1px;
   }
   ```

7. Save your code and load your HTML in a browser (refresh it if you've got it open from before). Your work-in-progress should look similar to this:

   ![A Mozilla logo and some paragraphs. A sans-serif font has been set, the font sizes, line height and letter spacing are adjusted, and the main page heading has been centered](website-screenshot-font-small.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > Try adjusting the `px` values until you end up with font sizes that you like for your heading and body text.

## CSS is all about boxes

Something you'll notice about CSS as you use it more is that a lot of it is about boxes. Most HTML elements on a page can be thought of as boxes that sit on top of (or alongside) other boxes. You can set values on these boxes for size, color, positioning, etc. This is referred to as [**the box model**](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Box_model).

![Three boxes sat inside one another. From outside to in they are labelled margin, border and padding](box-model.png)

Each box that takes up space on your page has properties like:

- {{cssxref("padding")}}: The space around the content. In the previous example, it is the space around the paragraph text.
- {{cssxref("border")}}: The solid line just outside the padding.
- {{cssxref("margin")}}: The space outside the border.

In this section, we also use the following properties, some of which you've seen before:

- {{cssxref("width")}}: The width of an element.
- {{cssxref("background-color")}}: The color behind an element's content and padding.
- {{cssxref("color")}}: The color of an element's content (usually text).
- {{cssxref("text-shadow")}}: A drop shadow on the text inside an element.
- {{cssxref("display")}}: The display mode of an element (which basically refers to how it appears or is laid out on the web page).

In each of the sections that follow:

1. Add the provided CSS code to the bottom of your `style.css` file.
2. Save the file and refresh your browser to see how the CSS has affected the HTML rendering.
3. Read the provided explanation to help you understand how the CSS works.
4. If you are feeling adventurous, experiment with changing the property values to further customize your page.

## Changing the page color

Add the following:

```css
html {
  background-color: #00539f;
}
```

This rule sets a background color for the entire page. Change the color code to the color you chose in [What will your website look like?](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website/What_will_your_website_look_like#choosing_a_theme_color).

## Styling the body

Next, add this rule:

```css
body {
  width: 600px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  background-color: #ff9500;
  padding: 0 20px 20px 20px;
  border: 5px solid black;
}
```

The above code sets new values for several properties of the {{htmlelement("body")}} element. Let's go through these line-by-line:

- `width: 600px;`: This forces the body to always be 600 pixels wide.
- `margin: 0 auto;`: When you set two values on a property like `margin` or `padding`, the first value affects the element's top _and_ bottom side (setting it to `0` in this case); the second value affects the left _and_ right side. `auto` is a special value that divides the available horizontal space evenly between left and right.
- `background-color: #FF9500;`: This sets the element's background color. Our project uses a reddish orange for the `<body>` background color to contrast with the dark blue used for the {{htmlelement("html")}} element.
- `padding: 0 20px 20px 20px;`: This sets four values for padding. The goal is to put some space around the content. In this example, there is no padding on the top of the body, and 20 pixels on the right, bottom, and left. The values set top, right, bottom, and left padding, in that order.
- `border: 5px solid black;`: This sets values for the width, style, and color of the border. In this case, it's a 5-pixel-wide solid black border around all sides of the body.

## Positioning and styling the main page title

Now add this:

```css
h1 {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 20px 0;
  color: #00539f;
  text-shadow: 3px 3px 1px black;
}
```

You may have noticed a horrible gap at the top of the body. That happens because browsers apply default styling to the `<h1>` element. That might seem like a bad idea, but the intent is to provide basic readability for unstyled pages. To eliminate the gap, we overwrite the browser's default styling with the setting `margin: 0;`.

Next, we set the heading's top and bottom padding to 20 pixels, and set the heading text to be the same color as the HTML background color.

Finally, `text-shadow` applies a shadow to the text content of the element:

- The first pixel value sets the **horizontal offset** of the shadow from the text: how far it moves across.
- The second pixel value sets the **vertical offset** of the shadow from the text: how far it moves down.
- The third pixel value sets the **blur radius** of the shadow. A larger value produces a more fuzzy-looking shadow.
- The fourth value sets the base color of the shadow.

## Centering the image

Finally, insert this rule:

```css
img {
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;
  max-width: 100%;
}
```

Next, we center the image to make it look better. We can use the same `margin: 0 auto` trick as we did for the body, but there are differences that require an additional setting to make the CSS work.

The {{htmlelement("body")}} element is a **block** element, meaning it takes up space on the page and can accept margin, padding, and other box properties. {{htmlelement("img")}} (image) elements, on the other hand, are **inline** elements: by default, they don't accept margin values in the same way block elements do. For the auto-margin trick to work on this image, we must give it block-level behavior by using `display: block;`.

Finally, we set the {{cssxref("max-width")}} property to `100%` to ensure that if the image is larger than the `width` set on the body (600 pixels), it will be constrained to `600px` and won't stretch wider.

> [!NOTE]
> Don't be too concerned if you don't completely understand `display: block;` and the differences between a block element and an inline element, or `max-width: 100%;`. They will make more sense as you continue your study of CSS.

## Conclusion

If you followed all the instructions in this article, you should have a page that looks similar to this one:

## First things first: planning

Before doing anything, you need some ideas. What should your website actually do? A website can do basically anything, but, for your first try, you should keep things simple. We'll start by creating a simple webpage with a heading, an image, and a few paragraphs.

To begin, you'll need to answer these questions:

1. **What is your website about?** Do you like dogs, New York, or Pac-Man?
2. **What information are you presenting on the subject?** Write a title and a few paragraphs and think of an image you'd like to show on your page.
3. **What does your website look like,** in simple high-level terms? What's the background color? What kind of font is appropriate: formal, cartoony, bold and loud, subtle?

> [!NOTE]
> Complex projects need detailed guidelines that go into all the details of colors, fonts, spacing between items on a page, appropriate writing style, and so on. This is sometimes called a design guide, design system, or brand book, and you can see an example at the [Firefox Acorn Design System](https://acorn.firefox.com/latest).

## Sketching out your design

Next, grab pen and paper and sketch out roughly how you want your site to look. For your first simple webpage, there's not much to sketch out, but you should get in the habit of doing this now. It really helps — you don't have to be Van Gogh!

![A rough drawing and sketch of a website on paper](website-drawing-scan.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Even on real, complex websites, the design teams usually start out with rough sketches on paper and later on build digital mockups using a graphics editor or web technologies.
>
> Web teams often include both a [graphic designer](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Soft_skills/Workflows_and_processes#graphic_designer) and a [user experience (UX) designer](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Soft_skills/Workflows_and_processes#user_experience_ux_designer). Graphic designers put together the visuals of the website. UX designers have a somewhat more abstract role in addressing how users will experience and interact with the website.

At this point, it's good to start putting together the content that will eventually appear on your webpage. You should still have your paragraphs and title from earlier. Keep these close by.

## Choosing a theme color

Let's choose a background color for your page.

1. Go to [the Color Picker](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_colors/Color_format_converter) and find a color you like.
2. When you pick a color, you'll see a strange six-character code like `#660066`. That's called a _hex code_ (short for hexadecimal), and represents your color. Copy the code down somewhere safe for now.

![Color format converter tool on MDN Docs website](color_format_converter.jpg)

## Choosing an image

Now it's time to find an image to show on your site.

1. Go to [Google Images](https://www.google.com/imghp).
2. Note that most images on the web, including in Google Images, are copyrighted. To reduce your likelihood of violating copyright, you can use Google's license filter. Click on the _Tools_ button, then on the resulting _Usage rights_ option that appears below. You should choose the option _Creative Commons licenses_.

   ![Filtered search results to get images of Creative Commons Licenses on Google Images](updated-google-images-licensing.png)

3. Search for a suitable image.
4. When you find the image you want, click on the image to get an enlarged view of it.
5. Right-click the image (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + click on a Mac), choose _Save Image As…_, and choose a safe place to save your image.

   ![Search results for a search term on Google Images](updated-google-images.png)

## Choosing a font

There is a set of fonts called the [web safe fonts](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Text_styling/Fundamentals#web_safe_fonts) — such as Arial, Times New Roman, or Courier New — that are generally available on most computer systems. If you use one of these fonts on your website, the browser will load the font file available on the user's computer.

However, if you want to use other fonts not generally available on devices, you need to either include them along with your website files or reference the font files from a third-party font service so the browser can download them as needed. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is one such service that provides access to many fonts.

Let's use Google fonts to choose a font for your website:

1. Go to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
2. Scroll down the list of fonts until you find one you like. If you are having trouble finding one, you can use the filters available in the other column to narrow down your search.
3. Click your font option, then on the next page click the "Get font" button.
4. On the next page, click "Get embed code".
5. Copy both of the provided code blocks, and save them somewhere safe for later use.

> [!NOTE]
> As with images, many fonts are protected by licenses, meaning you cannot necessarily use them freely on commercial websites. You will be fine for now while working on learning examples, but keep this in mind when choosing fonts for real websites.

## Summary

There's a reason we talk about web design. You start out with a blank page, and you can take it so many directions. And if you don't have much experience, starting out with a blank page might be a bit scary. We have over 25 years' experience and we'll give you some common rules of thumb to help you design your site.

Even now with the new focus on mobile Web, almost all mainstream webpages are built from these parts:

- Header
  - : Visible at the top of every page on the site. Contains information relevant to all pages (like site name or logo) and an easy-to-use navigation system.
- Main content
  - : The biggest region, containing content unique to the current page.
- Stuff on the side
  - : 1) Information complementing the main content; 2) information shared among a subset of pages; 3) alternative navigation system. In fact, everything not absolutely required by the page's main content.
- Footer
  - : Visible at the bottom of every page on the site. Like the header, contains less prominent global information like legal notices or contact info.

These elements are quite common in all form factors, but they can be laid out different ways. Here are some examples (**1** represents header, **2** footer; **A** main content; **B1, B2** things on the side):

**1-column layout**. Especially important for mobile browsers so you don't clutter the small screen up.

![Example of a 1 column layout: Main on top and asides stacked beneath it.](1-col-layout.png)

**2-column layout**. Often used to target tablets, since they have medium-size screens.

![Example of a basic 2 column layout: One aside on the left column, and main on the right column.](2-col-layout-right.png) ![Example of a basic 2 column layout: One aside on the right column, and main on the left column.](2-col-layout-left.png)

**3-column layouts**. Only suitable for desktops with big screens. (Even many desktop-users prefer viewing things in small windows rather than fullscreen.)

![Example of a basic 3 column layout: Aside on the left and right column, Main on the middle column.](3-col-layout.png) ![Another example of a 3 column layout: Aside side by side on the left, Main on the right column.](3-col-layout-alt.png) ![Another example of a 3 column layout: Aside side by side on the right, Main on the left column.](3-col-layout-alt2.png)

The real fun begins when you start mixing them all together:

![Example of mixed layout: Main on top and asides beneath it side by side.](1-col-layout-alt.png) ![Example of a mixed layout: Main on the left column and asides stack on top of each other on the right column](2-col-layout-left-alt.png) ![Example of a mixed layout: one aside on the left column and main in the right column with an aside beneath main.](2-col-layout-mix.png) ![Example of a mixed layout: Main on the left of the first row and one aside on the right of that same row, a second aside covering the whole second row.](2-col-layout-mix-alt.png)…

These are just examples and you're quite free to lay things out as you want. You may notice that, while the content can move around on the screen, we always keep the header (1) on top and the footer (2) at the bottom. Also, the main content (A) matters most, so give it most of the space.

These are rules of thumb you can draw on. There are complex designs and exceptions, of course. In other articles we'll discuss how to design responsive sites (sites that change depending on the screen size) and sites whose layouts vary between pages. For now, it's best to keep your layout consistent throughout your site.

## Deeper dive

Let's study some more concrete examples taken from well-known websites.

### One-column layout

A typical one-column layout providing all the information linearly on one page.

![Example of a 1 column layout in the wild](screenshot-product.jpg) ![1 column layout with header, main content, a stack of aside contents and a footer](screenshot-product-overlay.jpg)

Quite straightforward. Just remember, many people will still browse your site from desktops, so make your content usable/readable there as well.

### Two-column layout

Blogs usually have two columns, a fat one for the main content and a thin one for stuff on the side (like widgets, secondary navigation levels, and ads).

![Example of a 2 column layout for a blog](screenshot-blog.jpg) ![A 2 column layout with the main content on the left column](screenshot-blog-overlay.jpg)

In this example, look at the image (B1) right underneath the header. It's related to the main content, but the main content makes sense without it, so you could think of the image either as main content or as side content. It doesn't really matter. What does matter is, if you put something right under the header, it should either be main content or _directly related_ to the main content.

### It's a trap

**[MICA](https://www.mica.edu/about-mica/)**. This is a bit trickier. It looks like a three-column layout:

![Example of a false 3 columns layout](screenshot-education.jpg) ![It looks like a 3 columns layout but actually, the aside content is floating around.](screenshot-education-overlay.jpg)

But it's not! B1 and B2 float around the main content. Remember that word "float"--it will ring a bell when you start learning about {{Glossary("CSS")}}.

Why would you think it's a three-column layout? Because the image on the top-right is L-shaped, because B1 looks like a column supporting the shifted main content, and because the "M" and "I" of the MICA logo create a vertical line of force.

This is a good example of a classic layout supporting some design creativity. Simple layouts are easier to implement, but allow yourself room to express your creativity in this area.

### A much trickier layout

**The Opera de Paris**.

![An example of a tricky layout.](screenshot-opera.jpg) ![This is a 2 column layout but the header is overlapping the main content.](screenshot-opera-overlay.jpg)

Basically a two-column layout, but you'll notice many tweaks here and there that visually break up the layout. Especially, the header overlaps the image of the main content. The way the curve of the header's menu ties in with the curve at the bottom of the image, the header and main content look like one thing even though they're technically completely different. The Opera example looks more complex than the MICA example, but it's actually easier to implement (all right, "easy" _is_ a relative concept).

As you see, you can craft stunning websites even with just basic layouts. Have a look at your own favorite websites and ask yourself, where's the header, the footer, the main content, and the side content? That will inspire you for your own design and give you good hints for which designs work and which ones don't.

## Summary

When you're building a website, one top issue to consider is [Universal Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_design): accommodating all users regardless of disability, technical constraints, culture, location, and so on.

## Dig deeper

### Color contrast

To keep your text readable, use a text color that contrasts well with the background color. Make it extra easy to read the text, to help visually-impaired people and people using their phones on the street.

The {{Glossary("W3C")}} defines a good color mix with an algorithm that calculates luminosity ratio between foreground and background. The calculation may seem pretty complicated, but we can rely on tools to do the job for us.

Let's download and install the Paciello Group's [Color Contrast Analyser](https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/).

> [!NOTE]
> Alternatively you can find a number of contrast checkers online, such as WebAIM's [Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/). We suggest a local checker because it comes packaged with an on-screen color picker to find out a color value.

For instance, let's test the colors on this page and see how we fare in the color Contrast Analyser:

![Color contrast on this page: excellent!](color-contrast.png)

The luminosity contrast ratio between text and background is 8.30:1, which exceeds the minimum standard (4.5:1) and should enable many visually-impaired people to read this page.

### Font size

You can specify font size on a website either through relative units or absolute units.

#### Absolute units

Absolute units are not proportionally calculated but refer to a size set in stone, so to speak, and are expressed most of the time in pixels (`px`). For instance, if in your CSS you declare this:

```css
body {
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

… you are telling the browser that whatever happens, the font size must be 16 pixels. Modern browsers get around this rule by pretending that you're asking for "16 pixels when the user sets a zoom factor of 100%".

#### Relative units

Also called _proportional units,_ relative units are computed relative to a parent element. Relative units are friendlier to accessibility because they respect the settings on the user's system.

Relative units are expressed in `em`, `%` and `rem`:

- Percent-based sizes: `%`
  - : This unit tells your browser that an element's font size must be N% of the previous element whose font size was expressed. If no parent can be found, the default font size within the browser is considered as the base size for the calculation (usually the equivalent of 16 pixels).
- Em-based sizes: `em`
  - : This unit is calculated the same way as percents, except that you compute in portions of 1 and not portions of 100. It is said that "em" is the width of a capital "M" in the alphabet (roughly speaking, an "M" fits into a square).
- Rem-based sizes: `rem`
  - : This unit is proportional to the root element's font size and is expressed as portions of 1, like `em`.

Suppose we wanted a base font size of 16px and an h1 (main heading) at the equivalent of 32px, yet if within the h1 we find a `span` with the `subheading` class, it too must be rendered at the default font size (usually 16px).

Here is the HTML we're using:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Font size experiment</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>
      This is our main heading
      <span class="subheading">This is our subheading</span>
    </h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

A percent-based CSS will look like this:

```css
body {
  /* 100% of the browser's base font size, so in most cases this will render as 16 pixels */
  font-size: 100%;
}
h1 {
  /* twice the size of the body, thus 32 pixels */
  font-size: 200%;
}
span.subheading {
  /* half the size of the h1, thus 16 pixels to come back to the original size */
  font-size: 50%;
}
```

The same problem expressed with ems:

```css
body {
  /* 1em = 100% of the browser's base font size, so in most cases this will render as 16 pixels */
  font-size: 1em;
}
h1 {
  /* twice the size of the body, thus 32 pixels */
  font-size: 2em;
}
span.subheading {
  /* half the size of the h1, thus 16 pixels to come back to the original size */
  font-size: 0.5em;
}
```

As you can see, the math quickly gets daunting when you have to keep track of the parent, the parent's parent, the parent's parent's parent, and so on. (Most designs are done in pixel-based software, so the math has to be done by the person coding the CSS).

Enter `rem`. This unit is relative to the root element's size and not to any other parent. The CSS can be rewritten thus:

```css
body {
  /* 1em = 100% of the browser's base font size, so in most cases this will render as 16 pixels */
  font-size: 1em;
}
h1 {
  /* twice the size of the body, thus 32 pixels */
  font-size: 2rem;
}
span.subheading {
  /* original size */
  font-size: 1rem;
}
```

Easier, isn't it? This works as of [every current browser](https://caniuse.com/#search=rem), so please feel free to use this unit.

> You may notice Opera Mini does not support font sizing in rem. It will end up setting its own font size, so don't bother feeding it font units.

#### Why would I want to use proportional units?

Because you don't know when a browser is going to come around and refuse to zoom up text whose size is expressed in pixels. Also, check your website's statistics: you may receive visits from older browsers.

We would advise the following:

- Describe fonts in `rem` units, most browsers will be very happy with them;
- Let older browsers display fonts with their own internal engine. Browser's engines will ignore any property or value in the CSS if they can't cope with them, so that your website is still usable if not true to your designer's vision. Older browsers are on the way out anyway.

> [!NOTE]
> Your mileage may vary. If you have to cater to older browsers, you'll have to use `em`s and do a bit more math.

### Line width

There is a longstanding debate about line length on the web, but here's the story. Back when we had newspapers, printers realized that the reader's eyes would have trouble going from one line to the next if the lines were too long. The solution? Columns.

Of course the problem doesn't go away when we switch to the Web. The reader's eyes act like a shuttle going from line to line. To make it easier on people's eyes, limit line width to around 60 or 70 characters.

To achieve this, you can specify a size for your text's container. Let's consider this HTML:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Font size experiment</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <h1>
        This is our main heading
        <span class="subheading">This is our subheading</span>
      </h1>

      <p>[lengthy text that spans many lines]</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

We have a `div` with class `container`. We can style the `div` either to set its width (using the `width` property) or its maximum width so that it never gets too large (using the `max-width` property). If you want an elastic/responsive website, and you don't know what the browser's default width is, you can use the `max-width` property to allow up to 70 characters per line and no more:

```css
div.container {
  max-width: 70em;
}
```

### Alternative content for images, audio, and video

Websites often include stuff besides plain text.

#### Images

Images can be either decorative or informative, but there's no guarantee that your users can see them. For example,

- Visually impaired users rely on a screen reader, which can only handle text.
- Your readers may be using a very strict intranet that blocks images originating from a {{Glossary("CDN")}}.
- Your readers may have disabled images to save bandwidth, especially on mobile devices (see below).

<!---->

- Decorative images
  - : They're just for decoration and don't convey any real information. They could most often be replaced by a background image. Make sure they feature an empty `alt` attribute: `<img src="deco.gif" alt="">` so they don't clog up the text.
- Informative images
  - : They are used to convey information, hence their name. They can, for instance, feature a graph, or show a person's gesture, or any other information. At minimum, you must provide a relevant `alt` attribute.

If the image can be described succinctly, you can provide an `alt` attribute and nothing more. If the image cannot be described succinctly, you will have to either provide the same content in another form in the same page (e.g., complement a pie chart with a table providing the same data), or resort to a `longdesc` attribute. This attribute's value is a URL pointing towards a resource explicitly describing in detail the image's content.

> [!NOTE]
> The use and even the existence of `longdesc` has been debated for quite some time. Please refer to the W3C's [Image Description Extension (longdesc)](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-longdesc/) for the full explanation and thorough examples.

#### Audio/video

You must also provide alternatives to multimedia content.

- Subtitling/close-captioning
  - : You should include captions in your video to cater to visitors who can't hear the audio. Some users have hearing challenges, lack functioning speakers, or work in a noisy environment (like on the train).
- Transcript
  - : Subtitles only work if somebody watches the video. Many users don't have time, or lack the proper plugin or codec. Additionally, search engines rely mainly on text to index your contents. For all these reasons, please provide a text transcript of the video/audio file.

### Image compression

Some users may choose to display images, but still have limited bandwidth available, especially in developing countries and on mobile devices. If you want a successful website, please compress your images. There are various tools to help you, either online or local. Generally, local tools are preferred because they can be more integrated with your development workflow; these tools include [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/api) (Mac), [OptiPNG](https://optipng.sourceforge.net/) (all platforms), and [PNGcrush](https://pmt.sourceforge.io/pngcrush/) (DOS, Unix/Linux).
# What HTML features promote accessibility?

The following content describes specific features of HTML that should be used to make a web page more accessible to people with different disabilities.

## Link text

If you have a link that isn't self-descriptive, or the link destination could benefit from being explained in more detail, you can add information to a link using the [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) or [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) attributes.

```html
<p>
  I'm really bad at writing link text.
  <a
    href="inept.html"
    aria-label="Why I'm rubbish at writing link text: An explanation and an apology."
    >Click here</a
  >
  to find out more.
</p>
<p>
  I'm really <span id="incompetence">bad at writing link text</span>.
  <a href="inept.html" aria-labelledby="incompetence">Click here</a> to find out
  more.
</p>
```

Note that, most of the time, it is better to instead write useful link text:

```html
<p>
  I wrote a
  <a href="capable.html">blog post about how good I am at writing link text</a>.
</p>
```

## Skip Links

To aid tabbing, you can supply a [skip link](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/a#skip_links) that allow users to jump over chunks of your web page. You might want to allow someone to jump over a plethora of navigation links that are found on every page. This enables keyboard users to quickly tab over repeated content and go directly to the page's main content:

```html
<header>
  <h1>The Heading</h1>
  <a href="#content">Skip to content</a>
</header>

<nav>
  <!-- navigation stuff -->
</nav>

<section id="content">
  <!--your content -->
</section>
```

## Alt attribute for image

Every image should have an [`alt`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/img#alt) attribute. If the image is purely decoration and adds no meaning to the content or context of the document, the `alt` attribute should be present, but empty. You can optionally also add [`role="presentation"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/presentation_role). All other images should include an `alt` attribute providing [alternative text describing the image](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/alt#usage_notes) in a way that is helpful to users who can read the rest of the content but can't see the image. Think about how you would describe the image to someone who can't load your image: that's the information you should include as the value of the `alt` attribute.

```html
<!-- decorative image -->
<img alt="" src="blueswish.png" role="presentation" />
<img
  alt="The Open Web Docs logo: Carle the book worm smiling"
  src="carle.svg"
  role="img" />
```

The `alt` attribute for the same content may vary depending on the context. In the following example, an animated gif is used instead of a progress bar to show the page load progress for a document teaching developers how to use the HTML [`<progress>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/progress) element:

```html
<img alt="20% complete" src="load-progress.gif" />
<img
  alt="The progress bar is a thick green square to the left of the thumb and a thin grey line to the right. The thumb is a circle with a diameter the height of the green area."
  src="screenshot-progressbar.png" />
```

## ARIA role attribute

By default, all semantic elements in HTML have a [`role`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles); for example, `<input type="radio">` has the `radio` role. Non-semantic elements in HTML do not have a role. ARIA roles can be used to describe elements that don't natively exist in HTML, such as a [`tablist`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tablist_role) widget. Roles are also helpful for newer elements that exist but don't yet have full browser support. For example, when using SVG images, add `role="img"` to the opening tag, as there is an [SVG VoiceOver bug](https://webkit.org/b/216364) whereby VoiceOver does not correctly announce SVG images.

```html
<img src="mdn.svg" alt="MDN logo" role="img" />
```

## Summary

When starting with a web project, many people focus on the technical side. Of course you must be familiar with the technique of your craft, but what really matters is _what you want to accomplish_. Yes, it seems obvious, but too many projects fail not from a lack of technical know-how, but from lack of goals and vision.

So when you get an idea and want to turn it into a website, there are a few questions you should answer before anything else:

- What exactly do I want to accomplish?
- How will a website help me reach my goals?
- What needs to be done, and in what order, to reach my goals?

All of this is called _project ideation_ and is a necessary first step to reach your goal, whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer.

## Deeper dive

A project never starts with the technical side. Musicians will never make any music unless they first have an idea of what they want to play—and the same is true for painters, writers, and web developers. Technique comes second.

Technique is obviously critical. Musicians must master their instrument. But good musicians can never produce good music without an idea. Therefore, before jumping into the technical side — for example, code and tools—you must first step back and decide in detail what you want to do.

An hour's discussion with friends is a good start, but inadequate. You must sit down and structure your ideas to get a clear view of what path you must take to make your ideas a reality. To do this, you need only pen and paper and some time to answer at least the following questions.

> [!NOTE]
> There are countless ways to carry out project ideation. We cannot lay them all out here (a whole book wouldn't be enough). What we will present here is a simple method to handle what professionals call [Project Ideation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideation_(idea_generation)>), [Project Planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_planning), and [Project Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management).

### What exactly do I want to accomplish?

This is the most important question to answer, since it drives everything else. List all the goals you want to reach. It can be anything: selling goods to make money, expressing political opinions, meeting new friends, gigging with musicians, collecting cat pictures, or whatever you want.

Suppose you are a musician. You could wish to:

- Let people hear your music.
- Sell goodies.
- Meet other musicians.
- Talk about your music.
- Teach music through videos.
- Publish photos of your cats.
- Find a new apartment.

Once you have such a list, you need to prioritize. Order the goals from most important to least important:

1. Find a new apartment.
2. Let people hear your music.
3. Talk about your music.
4. Meet other musicians.
5. Sell goodies.
6. Teach music through videos.
7. Publish photos of your cats.

Doing this simple exercise—writing goals and sorting them—will help you out when you have decisions to make. (Should I implement these features, use these services, create these designs?)

So now that you have a prioritized list of goals, let's move on to the next question.

### How could a website bring me to my goals?

So you have a list of goals and you feel you need a website to reach those goals. Are you sure?

Let's look back at our example. We have five goals connected to music, one goal related to personal life (finding a new apartment), and the completely unrelated cat photos. Is it reasonable to build a single website to cover all those goals? Is it even necessary? After all, scores of existing web services might bring you to your goals without building a new website.

Finding a new apartment is a prime case where it makes more sense to use existing resources rather than build a whole new site. Why? Because we'll spend more time building and maintaining the website rather than actually searching for a new apartment. Since our goal is what matters most, we should spend our energy on leveraging existing tools rather than starting from scratch. Again, there are so many web services already available for showcasing photos that it isn't worth the effort to build a new site just to spread the word about how cute our cats are.

The other five goals are all connected to music. There are, of course, many web services that could handle these goals, but it makes sense in this case to build a dedicated website of our own. Such a website is the best way to _aggregate_ all the stuff we want to publish in a single place (good for goals 3, 5, and 6) and promote _interaction_ between us and the public (good for goals 2 and 4). In short, since these goals all revolve around the same topic, having everything in one place will help us meet our goals and help our followers connect with us.

How can a website help me reach my goals? By answering that, you'll find the best way to reach your goals and save yourself from wasted effort.

### What needs to be done, and in what order, to reach my goals?

Now that you know what you want to accomplish, it's time to turn those goals into actionable steps. As a side note, your goals are not necessarily set in stone. They evolve over time even in the course of the project, especially if you run across unexpected obstacles or just change your mind.

Rather than go through a long explanation, let's go back to our example with this table:

<table class="standard-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Goals</th>
      <th scope="col">Things to do</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Let people hear your music</td>
      <td>
        <ol>
          <li>Record music</li>
          <li>
            Prepare some audio files usable online (Could you do this with
            existing web services?)
          </li>
          <li>Give people access to your music on some part of your website</li>
        </ol>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Talk about your music</td>
      <td>
        <ol>
          <li>Write a few articles to start the discussion</li>
          <li>Define how articles should look</li>
          <li>Publish those articles on the website (How to do this?)</li>
        </ol>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Meet other musicians</td>
      <td>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Provide ways for people to contact you (Email? Facebook? Phone?
            Mail?)
          </li>
          <li>
            Define how people will find those contact channels from your website
          </li>
        </ol>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sell goodies</td>
      <td>
        <ol>
          <li>Create the goodies</li>
          <li>Store the goodies</li>
          <li>Find a way to handle shipping</li>
          <li>Find a way to handle payment</li>
          <li>Make a mechanism on your site for people to place orders</li>
        </ol>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Teach music through videos</td>
      <td>
        <ol>
          <li>Record video lessons</li>
          <li>
            Prepare video files viewable online (Again, could you do this with
            existing web services?)
          </li>
          <li>
            Give people access to your videos on some part of your website
          </li>
        </ol>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Two things to notice. First, some of these items are not web-related (e.g., record music, write articles). Often those offline activities matter even more than the web side of the project. In sales, for instance, it's far more important and time-consuming to handle supply, payment, and shipment than to build a website where people can place orders.

Second, setting out actionable steps leads to new questions you'll need to answer. Usually there turn out to be more questions than we originally thought. (For example, should I learn how to do all this myself, ask someone to do it for me, or use third-party services?)

## Conclusion

As you can see, the simple idea "I want to make a website" generates a long to-do list, which only grows longer as you think about it. Soon it may look overwhelming, but don't panic. You don't need to answer all the questions and you don't need to do everything on your list. What matters is to have a vision of what you want and how to get there. Once you have that clear vision, you need to decide how and when to do it. Break down big tasks into small, actionable steps. And those small steps will add up to great achievements.

From this article, you should now be able to make a rough plan for creating a website. A next step might be to read [how the Internet works](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Web_mechanics/How_does_the_Internet_work).

## Summary

Because of physical or technical limitations, maybe your visitors can't experience your website the way you hoped. In this article we give general accessibility principles and explain a few rules.

## Dig deeper

### Accessibility: general principles

We might associate accessibility at first with negative limitations. This building has to be accessible, so it must follow these regulations for door width and toilet size and elevator placement.

That's a narrow way to think of accessibility. Think of it as a wonderful way to empower people and serve more customers. What can the people in Brazil do with your English website? Can the people with smartphones browse a heavy, cluttered website designed for a large desktop monitor and unlimited bandwidth? They'll go somewhere else. In general, _we must think about our product from the viewpoints of all our target customers, and adapt accordingly._ Hence accessibility.

### Web accessibility

In the specific context of the web, accessibility means that anyone can benefit from your content, regardless of disability, location, technical limitations, or other circumstances.

Let's consider video:

- Hearing impairment
  - : How does a hearing-impaired person benefit from a video? You have to provide subtitles — or even better, a full text transcript.

    Also, make sure people can adjust the volume to accommodate their unique needs.

- Visual impairment
  - : Again, provide a text transcript that a user can consult without needing to play the video, and an audio-description (an off-screen voice that describes what is happening in the video).
- Pausing capacity
  - : Users may have trouble understanding someone in a video. Let them pause the video to read the subtitles or process the information.
- Keyboard capacity
  - : Let the user tab into/out of a video, play it, and pause it without being trapped in it.

#### The basics of Web accessibility

A few necessities for basic Web accessibility include:

- Whenever your site needs an image to convey meaning, include text as an alternative for visually-challenged users or those with slow connections.
- Make sure all users can operate graphical interfaces (like unfolding menus) solely with a keyboard (e.g., with Tab and the Return key).
- Provide an attribute explicitly specifying your content's language, so that screen readers read your text properly.
- Make sure that a user can navigate to all widgets on a page solely with the keyboard, without getting trapped. (At least let them Tab in and out.)

And that's just the beginning.

### Accessibility champions

Since 1999, the {{Glossary("W3C")}} has operated a working group called the {{Glossary("WAI","Web Accessibility Initiative")}} (WAI) promoting accessibility through guidelines, support material, and international resources.

## More details

Please refer to:

- [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility) about accessibility
- [WAI (W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)

## Next steps

Accessibility can impact both a website's design and technical structure.

- From a design point of view, we suggest learning about [designing for all types of users](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Design_and_accessibility/Design_for_all_types_of_users).
- If the technical side interests you more, you could learn how to [embed images in webpages](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/HTML_images).

# How to add a shadow to an element

In this guide you can find out how to add a shadow to any box on your page.

## Adding box shadows

Shadows are a common design feature that can help elements stand out on your page. In CSS, shadows on the boxes of elements are created using the {{cssxref("box-shadow")}} property (if you want to add a shadow to the text itself, you need {{cssxref("text-shadow")}}).

The `box-shadow` property takes a number of values:

- The offset on the x-axis
- The offset on the y-axis
- A blur radius
- A spread radius
- A color
- The `inset` keyword

In the example below we have set the X and Y axes to 5px, the blur to 10px and the spread to 2px. I am using a semi-transparent black as my color. Play with the different values to see how they change the shadow.

```html live-sample___box-shadow-button
<div class="wrapper">
  <button class="shadow">box-shadow</button>
</div>
```

```css hidden live-sample___box-shadow-button
.wrapper {
  height: 150px;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}

button {
  padding: 5px 10px;
  border: 0;
  border-radius: 5px;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 140%;
  background-color: #db1f48;
  color: white;
}
```

```css live-sample___box-shadow-button
.shadow {
  box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px 2px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.8);
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("box-shadow-button")}}

> [!NOTE]
> We are not using `inset` in this example, this means that the shadow is the default drop shadow with the box on top of the shadow. Inset shadows appear inside the box as if the content were pushed back into the page.

# How to add a shadow to text

In this guide, you'll learn how to add a shadow to any text on your page.

## Adding shadows to text

Our [guide to adding a shadow to boxes](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Solve_CSS_problems/Add_a_shadow) explains how to add a shadow to any element on your page. However, that technique only adds shadows to the element's surrounding box. To add a drop shadow to the text itself, you need a different CSS property: {{cssxref("text-shadow")}}.

The `text-shadow` property takes a number of values:

- The offset on the x-axis
- The offset on the y-axis
- A blur radius
- A color

In the example below, we have set the x-axis offset to `2px`, the y-axis offset to `4px`, the blur radius to `4px`, and the color to a semi-transparent blue. Play with the different values to see how they change the shadow effect.

```html live-sample___text-shadow
<div class="wrapper">
  <h1>Adding a shadow to text</h1>
</div>
```

```css live-sample___text-shadow
h1 {
  color: royalblue;
  text-shadow: 2px 4px 4px rgb(46 91 173 / 0.6);
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("Text_shadow")}}

> [!NOTE]
> When adding text shadows, you might unintentionally make the text difficult to read. Ensure that your choices offer sufficient [color contrast](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Guides/Understanding_WCAG/Perceivable/Color_contrast) to keep your text readable.
# How to center an item

In this guide you can find out how to center an item inside another element, both horizontally and vertically.

## Center a box

To center one box inside another using CSS you will need to use [CSS box alignment](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_box_alignment) properties on the parent container. As these alignment properties do not yet have browser support for block and inline layout you will need to make the parent a [flex](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout) or [grid](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout) container to turn on the ability to use alignment.

In the example below we have given the parent container `display: flex`; then set {{cssxref("justify-content")}} to center to align it horizontally, and {{cssxref("align-items")}} to center to align it vertically.

```html live-sample___center
<div class="wrapper">
  <div class="box">center me!</div>
</div>
```

```css live-sample___center
.wrapper {
  height: 200px;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}

.box {
  background-color: rgb(69 164 181);
  border-radius: 5px;
  padding: 10px;
  color: white;
}

# Create fancy boxes

CSS boxes are the building blocks of any web page styled with CSS. Making them nice looking is both fun and challenging. It's fun because it's all about turning a design idea into working code; it's challenging because of the constraints of CSS. Let's do some fancy boxes.

Before we start getting into the practical side of it, make sure you are familiar with [the CSS box model](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Box_model). It's also a good idea, but not a prerequisite, to be familiar with some [CSS layout basics](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Introduction).

On the technical side, Creating fancy boxes are all about mastering CSS border and background properties and how to apply them to a given box. But beyond the techniques it's also all about unleashing your creativity. It will not be done in one day, and some web developers spend their whole life having fun with it.

We are about to see many examples, but we will always work on the most simple piece of HTML possible, a simple element:

```html
<div class="fancy">Hi! I want to be fancy.</div>
```

Ok, that's a very small bit of HTML, what can we tweak on that element? All the following:

- Its box model properties: {{cssxref("width")}}, {{cssxref("height")}}, {{cssxref("padding")}}, {{cssxref("border")}}, etc.
- Its background properties: {{cssxref("background")}}, {{cssxref("background-color")}}, {{cssxref("background-image")}}, {{cssxref("background-position")}}, {{cssxref("background-size")}}, etc.
- Its pseudo-element: {{cssxref("::before")}} and {{cssxref("::after")}}
- and some aside properties like: {{cssxref("box-shadow")}}, {{cssxref("rotate")}}, {{cssxref("outline")}}, etc.

So we have a very large playground. Let the fun begin.

## Box model tweak

The box model alone allows us to do some basic stuff, like adding simple borders, making squares, etc. It starts to get interesting when you push the properties to the limit by having negative `padding` and/or- `margin` by having `border-radius` larger than the actual size of the box.

### Making circles

```html hidden
<div class="fancy">Hi! I want to be fancy.</div>
```

This is something that is both very simple and very fun. The {{cssxref("border-radius")}} property is made to create a rounded corner applied to boxes, but what happens if the radius size is equal or larger than the actual width of the box?

```css
.fancy {
  /* Within a circle, centered text looks prettier. */
  text-align: center;

  /* Let's avoid our text touching the border. As
     our text will still flow in a square, it looks
     nicer that way, giving the feeling that it's a "real"
     circle. */
  padding: 1em;

  /* The border will make the circle visible.
     You could also use a background, as
     backgrounds are clipped by border radius */
  border: 0.5em solid black;

  /* Let's make sure we have a square.
     If it's not a square, we'll get an
     ellipsis rather than a circle */
  width: 4em;
  height: 4em;

  /* and let's turn the square into a circle */
  border-radius: 100%;
}
```

Yes, we get a circle:

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Making_circles', '100%', '120') }}

## Backgrounds

When we talk about a fancy box, the core properties to handle that are [background-\* properties](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_backgrounds_and_borders). When you start fiddling with backgrounds it's like your CSS box is turned into a blank canvas you'll fill.

Before we jump to some practical examples, let's step back a bit as there are two things you should know about backgrounds.

- It's possible to set [several backgrounds](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_backgrounds_and_borders/Using_multiple_backgrounds) on a single box. They are stacked on top of each other like layers.
- Backgrounds can be either solid colors or images: solid color always fills the whole surface but images can be scaled and positioned.

```html hidden
<div class="fancy">Hi! I want to be fancy.</div>
```

Okay, let's have fun with backgrounds:

```css
.fancy {
  padding: 1em;
  width: 100%;
  height: 200px;
  box-sizing: border-box;

  /* At the bottom of our background stack,
     let's have a misty grey solid color */
  background-color: #e4e4d9;

  /* We stack linear gradients on top of each
     other to create our color strip effect.
     As you will notice, color gradients are
     considered to be images and can be
     manipulated as such */
  background-image:
    linear-gradient(175deg, transparent 95%, #8da389 95%),
    linear-gradient(85deg, transparent 95%, #8da389 95%),
    linear-gradient(175deg, transparent 90%, #b4b07f 90%),
    linear-gradient(85deg, transparent 92%, #b4b07f 92%),
    linear-gradient(175deg, transparent 85%, #c5a68e 85%),
    linear-gradient(85deg, transparent 89%, #c5a68e 89%),
    linear-gradient(175deg, transparent 80%, #ba9499 80%),
    linear-gradient(85deg, transparent 86%, #ba9499 86%),
    linear-gradient(175deg, transparent 75%, #9f8fa4 75%),
    linear-gradient(85deg, transparent 83%, #9f8fa4 83%),
    linear-gradient(175deg, transparent 70%, #74a6ae 70%),
    linear-gradient(85deg, transparent 80%, #74a6ae 80%);
}
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Backgrounds', '100%', '200') }}

> [!NOTE]
> Gradients can be used in some very creative ways. If you want to see some creative examples, take a look at [Lea Verou's CSS patterns](https://projects.verou.me/css3patterns/). If you want to learn more about gradients, feel free to get into [our dedicated article](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_images/Using_CSS_gradients).

## Pseudo-elements

When styling a single box, you could find yourself limited and could wish to have more boxes to create even more amazing styles. Most of the time, that leads to polluting the DOM by adding extra HTML element for the unique purpose of style. Even if it is necessary, it's somewhat considered bad practice. One solution to avoid such pitfalls is to use [CSS pseudo-elements](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements).

### A cloud

```html hidden
<div class="fancy">Hi! I want to be fancy.</div>
```

Let's have an example by turning our box into a cloud:

```css
.fancy {
  text-align: center;

  /* Same trick as previously used to make circles */
  box-sizing: border-box;
  width: 150px;
  height: 150px;
  padding: 80px 1em 0 1em;

  /* We make room for the "ears" of our cloud */
  margin: 0 100px;

  position: relative;

  background-color: #a4c9cf;

  /* Well, actually we are not making a full circle
     as we want the bottom of our cloud to be flat.
     Feel free to tweak this example to make a cloud
     that isn't flat at the bottom ;) */
  border-radius: 100% 100% 0 0;
}

/* Those are common style that apply to both our ::before
   and ::after pseudo elements. */
.fancy::before,
.fancy::after {
  /* This is required to be allowed to display the
     pseudo-elements, event if the value is an empty
     string */
  content: "";

  /* We position our pseudo-elements on the left and
     right sides of the box, but always at the bottom */
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 0;

  /* This makes sure our pseudo-elements will be below
     the box content whatever happens. */
  z-index: -1;

  background-color: #a4c9cf;
  border-radius: 100%;
}

.fancy::before {
  /* This is the size of the clouds left ear */
  width: 125px;
  height: 125px;

  /* We slightly move it to the left */
  left: -80px;

  /* To make sure that the bottom of the cloud
     remains flat, we must make the bottom right
     corner of the left ear square. */
  border-bottom-right-radius: 0;
}

.fancy::after {
  /* This is the size of the clouds left ear */
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;

  /* We slightly move it to the right */
  right: -60px;

  /* To make sure that the bottom of the cloud
     remains flat, we must make the bottom left
     corner of the right ear square. */
  border-bottom-left-radius: 0;
}
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('A_cloud', '100%', '160') }}

### Blockquote

A more practical example of using pseudo-elements is to build a nice formatting for HTML {{HTMLElement('blockquote')}} elements. So let's see an example with a slightly different HTML snippet (which provide us an opportunity to see how to also handle design localization):

```html
<blockquote>
  People who think they know everything are a great annoyance to those of us who
  do. <i>Isaac Asimov</i>
</blockquote>
<blockquote lang="fr">
  L'intelligence, c'est comme les parachutes, quand on n'en a pas, on s'écrase.
  <i>Pierre Desproges</i>
</blockquote>
```

So here comes our style:

```css
blockquote {
  min-height: 5em;
  padding: 1em 4em;
  font: 1em/150% sans-serif;
  position: relative;
  background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow;
}

blockquote::before,
blockquote::after {
  position: absolute;
  height: 3rem;
  font:
    6rem/100% "Georgia",
    serif;
}

blockquote::before {
  content: "“";
  top: 0.3rem;
  left: 0.9rem;
}

blockquote::after {
  content: "”";
  bottom: 0.3rem;
  right: 0.8rem;
}

blockquote:lang(fr)::before {
  content: "«";
  top: -1.5rem;
  left: 0.5rem;
}

blockquote:lang(fr)::after {
  content: "»";
  bottom: 2.6rem;
  right: 0.5rem;
}

blockquote i {
  display: block;
  font-size: 0.8em;
  margin-top: 1rem;
  text-align: right;
}
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Blockquote', '100%', '300') }}

## All together and more

So it's possible to create a wonderful effect when we mix all of this together. At some point, to accomplish such box embellishment is a matter of creativity, both in design and technical use of CSS properties. By doing such it's possible to create optical illusions that can bring your boxes alive like in this example:

```html hidden
<div class="fancy">Hi! I want to be fancy.</div>
```

Let's create some partial drop-shadow effects. The {{cssxref("box-shadow")}} property allow us to create inner light and a flat drop shadow effect, but with some little extra work it becomes possible to create a more natural geometry by using a pseudo-element and the {{cssxref("rotate")}} property, one of the three individual {{cssxref("transform")}} properties.

```css
.fancy {
  position: relative;
  background-color: #ffffcc;
  padding: 2rem;
  text-align: center;
  max-width: 200px;
}

.fancy::before {
  content: "";

  position: absolute;
  z-index: -1;
  bottom: 15px;
  right: 5px;
  width: 50%;
  top: 80%;
  max-width: 200px;

  box-shadow: 0px 13px 10px black;
  rotate: 4deg;
}
```

# CSS FAQ

In this article, you'll find some frequently-asked questions (FAQs) about CSS, along with answers that may help you on your quest to become a web developer.

## Why doesn't my CSS, which is valid, render correctly?

Browsers use the `doctype` declaration to choose whether to show the document using a mode that is more compatible with Web standards or with old browser bugs. Using a correct and modern `doctype` declaration at the start of your HTML will improve browser standards compliance.

Modern browsers have two main rendering modes:

- _Quirks Mode_: also called backwards-compatibility mode, allows legacy webpages to be rendered as their authors intended, following the non-standard rendering rules used by older browsers. Documents with an incomplete, incorrect, or missing `doctype` declaration or a known `doctype` declaration in common use before 2001 will be rendered in Quirks Mode.
- _Standards Mode_: the browser attempts to follow the W3C standards strictly. New HTML pages are expected to be designed for standards-compliant browsers, and as a result, pages with a modern `doctype` declaration will be rendered with Standards Mode.

Gecko-based browsers have a third [limited quirks mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirks_mode#Limited_quirks_mode) that has only a few minor quirks.

The standard `doctype` declaration that will trigger standards mode is:

```html
<!doctype html>
```

When at all possible, you should just use the above doctype. There are other valid legacy doctypes that will trigger Standards or Almost Standards mode:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
```

## Why doesn't my CSS, which is valid, render at all?

Here are some possible causes:

- You've got the path to CSS file wrong.
- To be applied, a CSS stylesheet must be served with a `text/css` MIME type. If the Web server doesn't serve it with this type, it won't be applied.

## What is the difference between `id` and `class`?

HTML elements can have an `id` and/or `class` attribute. The `id` attribute assigns a name to the element it is applied to, and for valid markup, there can be only one element with that name. The `class` attribute assigns a class name to the element, and that name can be used on many elements within the page. CSS allows you to apply styles to particular `id` and/or `class` names.

- Use a class-specific style when you want to apply the styling rules to many blocks and elements within the page, or when you currently only have element to style with that style, but you might want to add more later.
- Use an id-specific style when you need to restrict the applied styling rules to one specific block or element. This style will only be used by the element with that particular id.

It is generally recommended to use classes as much as possible, and to use ids only when absolutely necessary for specific uses (like to connect label and form elements or for styling elements that must be semantically unique):

- Using classes makes your styling extensible — even if you only have one element to style with a particular ruleset now, you might want to add more later.
- Classes allow you to style multiple elements, therefore they can lead to shorter stylesheets, rather than having to write out the same styling information in multiple rules that use id selectors. Shorter stylesheets are more performant.
- Class selectors have lower [specificity](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Handling_conflicts#specificity) than id selectors, so are easier to override if needed.

> [!NOTE]
> See [Selectors](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Basic_selectors) for more information.

## How do I restore the default value of a property?

Initially CSS didn't provide a "default" keyword and the only way to restore the default value of a property is to explicitly re-declare that property. For example:

```css
/* Heading default color is black */
h1 {
  color: red;
}
h1 {
  color: black;
}
```

This has changed with CSS 2; the keyword [initial](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/initial) is now a valid value for a CSS property. It resets it to its default value, which is defined in the CSS specification of the given property.

```css
/* Heading default color is black */
h1 {
  color: red;
}
h1 {
  color: initial;
}
```

## How do I derive one style from another?

CSS does not exactly allow one style to be defined in terms of another. However, assigning multiple classes to a single element can provide the same effect, and [CSS Variables](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascading_variables/Using_CSS_custom_properties) now provide a way to define style information in one place that can be reused in multiple places.

## How do I assign multiple classes to an element?

HTML elements can be assigned multiple classes by listing the classes in the `class` attribute, with a blank space to separate them.

```html
<style>
  .news {
    background: black;
    color: white;
  }
  .today {
    font-weight: bold;
  }
</style>

<div class="news today">Content of today's news goes here.</div>
```

If the same property is declared in both rules, the conflict is resolved first through specificity, then according to the order of the CSS declarations. The order of classes in the `class` attribute is not relevant.

## Why don't my style rules work properly?

Style rules that are syntactically correct may not apply in certain situations. You can use [Rules view](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/page_inspector/how_to/examine_and_edit_css/index.html) of _CSS Pane_ of the Inspector to debug problems of this kind, but the most frequent instances of ignored style rules are listed below.

### HTML elements hierarchy

The way CSS styles are applied to HTML elements depends also on the elements' hierarchy. It is important to remember that a rule applied to a descendant overrides the style of the parent, in spite of any specificity or priority of CSS rules.

```css
.news {
  color: black;
}
.corpName {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: red;
}
```

```html
<!-- news item text is black, but corporate name is red and in bold -->
<div class="news">
  (Reuters) <span class="corpName">General Electric</span> (GE.NYS) announced on
  Thursday…
</div>
```

In case of complex HTML hierarchies, if a rule seems to be ignored, check if the element is inside another element with a different style.

### Explicitly re-defined style rule

In CSS stylesheets, order **is** important. If you define a rule and then you re-define the same rule, the last definition is used.

```css
#stockTicker {
  font-weight: bold;
}
.stockSymbol {
  color: red;
}
/*  other rules             */
/*  other rules             */
/*  other rules             */
.stockSymbol {
  font-weight: normal;
}
```

```html
<!-- most text is in bold, except "GE", which is red and not bold -->
<div id="stockTicker">NYS: <span class="stockSymbol">GE</span> +1.0…</div>
```

To avoid this kind of error, try to define rules only once for a certain selector, and group all rules belonging to that selector.

### Use of a shorthand property

Using shorthand properties for defining style rules is good because it uses a very compact syntax. Using shorthand with only some attributes is possible and correct, but it must be remembered that undeclared attributes are automatically reset to their default values. This means that a previous rule for a single attribute could be implicitly overridden.

```css
#stockTicker {
  font-size: 12px;
  font-family: "Verdana";
  font-weight: bold;
}
.stockSymbol {
  font: 14px "Arial";
  color: red;
}
```

```html
<div id="stockTicker">NYS: <span class="stockSymbol">GE</span> +1.0…</div>
```

In the previous example the problem occurred on rules belonging to different elements, but it could happen also for the same element, because rule order **is** important.

```css
#stockTicker {
  font-weight: bold;
  font: 12px "Verdana"; /* font-weight is now set to normal */
}
```

### Use of the `*` selector

The `*` wildcard selector refers to any element, and it has to be used with particular care.

```css
body * {
  font-weight: normal;
}
#stockTicker {
  font: 12px "Verdana";
}
.corpName {
  font-weight: bold;
}
.stockUp {
  color: red;
}
```

```html
<div id="section">
  NYS: <span class="corpName"><span class="stockUp">GE</span></span> +1.0…
</div>
```

In this example the `body *` selector applies the rule to all elements inside body, at any hierarchy level, including the `.stockUp` class. So `font-weight: bold;` applied to the `.corpName` class is overridden by `font-weight: normal;` applied to all elements in the body.

The use of the \* selector should be minimized as it is a slow selector, especially when not used as the first element of a selector. Its use should be avoided as much as possible.

### Specificity in CSS

When multiple rules apply to a certain element, the rule chosen depends on its style [specificity](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Handling_conflicts#specificity). Inline style (in HTML `style` attributes) has the highest specificity and will override any selectors, followed by ID selectors, then class selectors, and eventually element selectors. The text color of the below {{htmlelement("div")}} will therefore be red.

```css
div {
  color: black;
}
#orange {
  color: orange;
}
.green {
  color: green;
}
```

```html
<div id="orange" class="green" style="color: red;">This is red</div>
```

The rules are more complicated when the selector has multiple parts. A more detailed explanation about how selector specificity is calculated can be found in the [CSS specificity documentation](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Specificity).

## What do the -moz-\*, -ms-\*, -webkit-\*, -o-\* and -khtml-\* properties do?

These properties, called _prefixed properties_, are extensions to the CSS standard. They were once used to allow the use of experimental and non-standard features in browsers without polluting the regular namespace, preventing future incompatibilities to arise when the standard is extended.

The use of such properties on production websites is not recommended — they have already created a huge web compatibility mess. For example, many developers only use the `-webkit-` prefixed version of a property when the non-prefixed version is fully supported across all browsers. This means a design relying on that property would not work in non-webkit-based browsers, when it could. This became a problem great enough that other browsers were pushed to implement `-webkit-` prefixed aliases to improve web compatibility, as specified in the [Compatibility Living Standard](https://compat.spec.whatwg.org/).

Browsers no longer use CSS prefixes when implementing new experimental features. Rather, they test new features behind configurable experimental flags or only on Nightly browser versions or similar.

If you are required to use prefixes in your work, write the prefixed versions first followed by the non-prefixed standard version. This way the standard version will automatically override the prefixed versions when supported. For example:

```css
-webkit-border-after-color: navy;
border-block-end-color: navy;
```

> [!NOTE]
> See the [Mozilla CSS Extensions](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Mozilla_Extensions) and [WebKit CSS Extensions](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/WebKit_Extensions) for lists of browser-prefixed CSS properties.

## How does z-index relate to positioning?

The `z-index` property specifies the stack order of elements.

An element with a higher z-index/stack order is always rendered in front of an element with a lower z-index/stack order on the screen. Z-index will only work on elements that have a specified position (`position:absolute`, `position:relative`, or `position:fixed`).

> [!NOTE]
> For more information, see our [Positioning](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Positioning) learning article, and in particular the [Introducing z-index](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Positioning#introducing_z-index) section.
# How to fill a box with an image without distorting it

In this guide you can learn a technique for causing an HTML image to completely fill a box.

## Using object-fit

When you add an image to a page using the HTML {{htmlelement("img")}} element, the image will maintain the size and {{glossary("aspect ratio")}} of the image file, or that of any HTML [`width`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/img#width) or [`height`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/img#height) attributes. Sometimes you would like the image to completely fill the box that you have placed it in. In that case you first need to decide what happens if the image is the wrong aspect ratio for the container.

1. The image should completely fill the box, retaining aspect ratio, and cropping any excess on the side that is too big to fit.
2. The image should fit inside the box, with the background showing through as bars on the too-small side.
3. The image should fill the box and stretch, which may mean it displays at the wrong aspect ratio.

The {{cssxref("object-fit")}} property makes each of these approaches possible. In the example below you can see how different values of `object-fit` work when using the same image. Select the approach that works best for your design.

```html live-sample___object-fit
<div class="wrapper">
  <div class="box box1">
    <img
      alt="a colorful hot air balloon against a clear sky"
      src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/balloon.jpg" />
  </div>
  <div class="box box2">
    <img
      alt="a colorful hot air balloon against a clear sky"
      src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/balloon.jpg" />
  </div>
  <div class="box box3">
    <img
      alt="a colorful hot air balloon against a clear sky"
      src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/balloon.jpg" />
  </div>
</div>
```

```css live-sample___object-fit
.wrapper {
  height: 200px;
  display: flex;
  gap: 20px;
}

.box {
  border: 5px solid black;
}

.box img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}

.box1 img {
  object-fit: cover;
}

.box2 img {
  object-fit: contain;
}

.box3 img {
  object-fit: fill;
}
```

# Use CSS generated content

This article describes some ways in which you can use CSS to add content when a document is displayed. You modify your stylesheet to add text content or images.

One of the important advantages of CSS is that it helps you to separate a document's style from its content. However, there are situations where it makes sense to specify certain content as part of the stylesheet, not as part of the document. You can specify text or image content within a stylesheet when that content is closely linked to the document's structure.

> [!NOTE]
> Content specified in a stylesheet does not become part of the DOM.

Specifying content in a stylesheet can cause complications. For example, you might have different language versions of your document that share a stylesheet. If you specify content in your stylesheet that requires translation, you have to put those parts of your stylesheet in different files and arrange for them to be linked with the appropriate language versions of your document.

This issue does not arise if the content you specify consists of symbols or images that apply in all languages and cultures.

## Examples

### Text content

CSS can insert text content before or after an element, or change the content of a list item marker (such as a bullet symbol or number) before a {{HTMLElement('li')}} or other element with {{ cssxref("display", "display: list-item;") }}. To specify this, make a rule and add {{ cssxref("::before") }}, {{ cssxref("::after") }}, or {{cssxref("::marker")}} to the selector. In the declaration, specify the {{ cssxref("content") }} property with the text content as its value.

#### HTML

```html
A text where I need to <span class="ref">something</span>
```

#### CSS

```css
.ref::before {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: navy;
  content: "Reference ";
}
```

#### Output

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Text_content', 600, 30) }}

The character set of a stylesheet is UTF-8 by default, but it can also be specified in the link, in the stylesheet itself, or in other ways. For details, see the [`@charset`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@charset) reference.

Individual characters can also be specified by an escape mechanism that uses backslash as the escape character. For example, "\265B" is the chess symbol for a black queen ♛.

### Image content

To add an image before or after an element, you can specify the URL of an image file in the value of the {{ cssxref("content") }} property.

This rule adds a space and an icon after every link that has the class `glossary`:

#### HTML

```html
<a href="developer.mozilla.org" class="glossary">developer.mozilla.org</a>
```

#### CSS

```css
a.glossary::after {
  content: " " url("glossary-icon.gif");
}
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Image_content', 600, 40) }}
# How to highlight the first line of a paragraph

In this guide you will find out how to highlight the first line of text in a paragraph, even if you don't know how long that line will be.

## Styling the first line of text

You would like to make the first line of a paragraph larger and bold. Wrapping a `<span>` around the first line means that you can style it however, if the first line becomes shorter due to a smaller viewport size, the styled text will wrap onto the next line.

## Using a pseudo-element

A {{cssxref("pseudo-elements", "pseudo-element")}} can take the place of the `<span>`; however, it is more flexible — the exact content selected by a pseudo-element is calculated once the browser has rendered the content, so it will work even if the viewport size changes.

In this case we need to use the {{cssxref("::first-line")}} pseudo-element. It selects the first formatted line of each paragraph, meaning that you can style it as you require.

```html live-sample___highlight_first_line
<div class="wrapper">
  <p>
    Veggies es bonus vobis, proinde vos postulo essum magis kohlrabi welsh onion
    daikon amaranth tatsoi tomatillo melon azuki bean garlic.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gumbo beet greens corn soko endive gumbo gourd. Parsley shallot courgette
    tatsoi pea sprouts fava bean collard greens dandelion okra wakame tomato.
    Dandelion cucumber earthnut pea peanut soko zucchini.
  </p>
</div>
```

```css live-sample___highlight_first_line
.wrapper p::first-line {
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 130%;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("highlight_first_line")}}

> [!NOTE]
> All pseudo-elements act in this way. They behave as if you had inserted an element into the document, but they do so dynamically based on the content as it displays at runtime.

## Combining pseudo-elements with other selectors

In the example above, the pseudo-element selects the first line of every paragraph. To select only the first line of the first paragraph, you can combine it with another selector. In this case, we use the {{cssxref(":first-child")}} {{cssxref("pseudo-classes", "pseudo-class")}}. This allows us to select the first line of the first child of `.wrapper` if that first child is a paragraph.

```html live-sample___highlight_first_line2
<div class="wrapper">
  <p>
    Veggies es bonus vobis, proinde vos postulo essum magis kohlrabi welsh onion
    daikon amaranth tatsoi tomatillo melon azuki bean garlic.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gumbo beet greens corn soko endive gumbo gourd. Parsley shallot courgette
    tatsoi pea sprouts fava bean collard greens dandelion okra wakame tomato.
    Dandelion cucumber earthnut pea peanut soko zucchini.
  </p>
</div>
```

```css live-sample___highlight_first_line2
.wrapper p:first-child::first-line {
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 130%;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("highlight_first_line2")}}

> [!NOTE]
> When combining pseudo-elements with other selectors in a [complex](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_selectors/Selector_structure#complex_selector) or [compound](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_selectors/Selector_structure#compound_selector) selector, the pseudo-elements must appear after all the other components in the selector in which they appear.

# How to highlight the first paragraph

In this guide you can find out how to highlight the first paragraph inside a container.

## Styling the first paragraph

You would like to make the first paragraph larger and bold. You could add a class to the first paragraph and select it that way, however using a pseudo-class selector is more flexible — it means that you can target the paragraph based on its location in the document, and you won't have to manually move the class if the source order changes.

## Using a pseudo-class

A {{cssxref("pseudo-classes","pseudo-class")}} acts as if you have applied a class; however, rather than using a class selector CSS selects based on the document structure. There are a number of different pseudo-classes that can select different things. In our case we are going to use {{cssxref(":first-child")}}. This will select the element that is the first-child of a parent.

```html live-sample___highlight_first_para
<div class="wrapper">
  <p>
    Veggies es bonus vobis, proinde vos postulo essum magis kohlrabi welsh onion
    daikon amaranth tatsoi tomatillo melon azuki bean garlic.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gumbo beet greens corn soko endive gumbo gourd. Parsley shallot courgette
    tatsoi pea sprouts fava bean collard greens dandelion okra wakame tomato.
    Dandelion cucumber earthnut pea peanut soko zucchini.
  </p>
</div>
```

```css live-sample___highlight_first_para
.wrapper p:first-child {
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 130%;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("highlight_first_para")}}

You can try changing {{cssxref(":first-child")}} to {{cssxref(":last-child")}} in the live example above, and you will select the last paragraph.

Whenever you need to target something in your document, you can check to see if one of the available {{cssxref("pseudo-classes")}} can do it for you.

# How to highlight a paragraph that comes after a heading

In this guide you can find out how to highlight a paragraph that comes directly after a heading.

## Styling the first paragraph after a heading

A common pattern is to style the first paragraph in an article differently to the ones that come after it. Usually this first paragraph will come right after a heading, and if this is the case in your design you can use that combination of elements to target the paragraph.

## The next-sibling combinator

CSS has a group of [CSS Selectors](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_selectors) which are referred to as **combinators**, because they select things based on a combination of selectors. In our case, we will use the [next-sibling combinator](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Next-sibling_combinator). This combinator selects an element based on it being next to another element. In our HTML we have a {{htmlelement("Heading_Elements", "h1")}} followed by a {{htmlelement("p")}}. The `<p>` is the next sibling of the `<h1>` so we can select it with `h1 + p`.

```html live-sample___highlight_h1_plus_para
<div class="wrapper">
  <h1>A heading</h1>
  <p>
    Veggies es bonus vobis, proinde vos postulo essum magis kohlrabi welsh onion
    daikon amaranth tatsoi tomatillo melon azuki bean garlic.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gumbo beet greens corn soko endive gumbo gourd. Parsley shallot courgette
    tatsoi pea sprouts fava bean collard greens dandelion okra wakame tomato.
    Dandelion cucumber earthnut pea peanut soko zucchini.
  </p>
</div>
```

```css live-sample___highlight_h1_plus_para
.wrapper h1 + p {
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 130%;
  color: rebeccapurple;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("highlight_h1_plus_para", "", "220px")}}

# How to make a box semi-transparent

This guide will help you to understand the ways to make a box semi-transparent using CSS.

## Change the opacity of the box and content

If you would like the box and all of the contents of the box to change opacity, then the CSS {{cssxref("opacity")}} property is the tool to reach for. Opacity is the opposite of transparency; therefore `opacity: 1` is fully opaque—you will not see through the box at all.

Using a value of `0` would make the box completely transparent, and values between the two will change the opacity, with higher values giving less transparency.

## Changing the opacity of the background color only

In many cases you will only want to make the background color itself partly transparent, keeping the text and other elements fully opaque. To achieve this, use a [`<color>`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) value that has an alpha channel, such as `rgb()`. As with `opacity`, a value of `1` for the alpha channel value makes the color fully opaque. Therefore, `background-color: rgb(0 0 0 / 50%);` will set the background color to 50% opacity.

Try changing the opacity and alpha channel values in the below examples to see more or less of the background image behind the box.

```html live-sample___opacity
<div class="wrapper">
  <div class="box box1">This box uses opacity</div>
  <div class="box box2">
    This box has a background color with an alpha channel
  </div>
</div>
```

```css hidden live-sample___opacity
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

.wrapper {
  height: 200px;
  display: flex;
  gap: 20px;
  background-image: url("https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/balloon.jpg");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: cover;
  padding: 20px;
}

.box {
  flex: 1;
  border: 5px solid black;
  border-radius: 0.5em;
  font-size: 140%;
  padding: 20px;
}
```

```css live-sample___opacity
.box1 {
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
  opacity: 0.5;
}

.box2 {
  background-color: rgb(0 0 0 / 0.5);
  color: white;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("opacity", "", "280px")}}

> [!NOTE]
> Take care that your text retains enough contrast with the background in cases where you are overlaying an image; otherwise you may make the content hard to read.

# How to fade a button on hover

In this guide you can find out how to do a gentle fade between two colors when hovering over a button.

In our button example, we can change the background of our button by defining a different background color for the `:hover` dynamic pseudo-class. However, hovering over the button will cause the background-color to snap to the new color. To create a more gentle change between the two, we can use CSS Transitions.

## Using transitions

After adding the desired color for the hover state, add the {{cssxref("transition")}} property to the rules for the button. For a simple transition, the value of `transition` is the name of the property or properties you wish this transition to apply to, and the time that the transition should take.

For the `:active` and `:focus` pseudo-classes the {{cssxref("transition")}} property is set to none, so that the button snaps to the active state when clicked.

In the example the transition takes 1 second, you can try changing this to see the difference a change in speed makes.

```html live-sample___transition-button
<div class="wrapper">
  <button class="fade">Hover over me</button>
</div>
```

```css hidden live-sample___transition-button
.wrapper {
  height: 150px;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}

button {
  padding: 5px 10px;
  border: 0;
  border-radius: 5px;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 140%;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.fade:focus,
.fade:active {
  background-color: black;
}
```

```css live-sample___transition-button
.fade {
  background-color: #db1f48;
  color: white;
  transition: background-color 1s;
}

.fade:hover {
  background-color: #004369;
}

.fade:focus,
.fade:active {
  background-color: black;
  transition: none;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("transition-button")}}

> [!NOTE]
> The {{cssxref("transition")}} property is a shorthand for {{cssxref("transition-delay")}}, {{cssxref("transition-duration")}}, {{cssxref("transition-property")}}, and {{cssxref("transition-timing-function")}}. See the pages for these properties on MDN to find ways to tweak your transitions.

# Solve common JavaScript problems

The following links point to solutions to common problems you may encounter when writing JavaScript.

## Common beginner's mistakes

### Correct spelling and casing

If your code doesn't work and/or the browser complains that something is undefined, check that you've spelt all your variable names, function names, etc. correctly.

Some common built-in browser functions that cause problems are:

| Correct                    | Wrong                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `getElementsByTagName()`   | `getElementByTagName()`   |
| `getElementsByName()`      | `getElementByName()`      |
| `getElementsByClassName()` | `getElementByClassName()` |
| `getElementById()`         | `getElementsById()`       |

### Semicolon position

You need to make sure you don't place any semicolons incorrectly. For example:

| Correct                     | Wrong                       |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `elem.style.color = 'red';` | `elem.style.color = 'red;'` |

### Functions

There are a number of things that can go wrong with functions.

One of the most common errors is to declare the function, but not call it anywhere. For example:

```js
function myFunction() {
  alert("This is my function.");
}
```

This code won't do anything unless you call it with the following statement:

```js
myFunction();
```

#### Function scope

Remember that [functions have their own scope](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Functions#function_scope_and_conflicts) — you can't access a variable value set inside a function from outside the function, unless you declared the variable globally (i.e., not inside any functions), or [return the value](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Return_values) from the function.

#### Running code after a return statement

Remember also that when you return from a function, the JavaScript interpreter exits the function — no code after the return statement will run.

In fact, some browsers (like Firefox) will give you an error message in the developer console if you have code after a return statement. Firefox gives you "unreachable code after return statement".

### Object notation versus normal assignment

When you assign something normally in JavaScript, you use a single equals sign, e.g.:

```js
const myNumber = 0;
```

With [Objects](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Advanced_JavaScript_objects), however, you need to take care to use the correct syntax. The object must be surrounded by curly braces, member names must be separated from their values using colons, and members must be separated by commas. For example:

```js
const myObject = {
  name: "Chris",
  age: 38,
};
```

# What text editors are available?

In this article we highlight some things to think about when installing a text editor for web development.

        Learn how to choose a text editor that best suits your needs as a web

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Summary

A website consists mostly of text files, so for a fun, pleasant development experience you should choose your text editor wisely.

The sheer number of choices is a bit overwhelming, since a text editor is so basic to computer science (yes, web development is computer science). Ideally, you'd try as many editors as you can and get a feel for what suits your workflow. But we'll give you some pointers for getting started.

Here are the primary questions you should consider:

- Which OS (operating system) do I want to work with?
- What kind of technologies do I want to manipulate?
- What kind of basic features do I expect from my text editor?
- Do I want to add extra features to my text editor?
- Do I need support/help while using my text editor?
- Does my text editor's look-and-feel matter to me?

Notice we didn't mention price. Obviously, that matters too, but a product's cost has little connection with its quality or capability. There's a big chance you'll find a suitable text editor for free.

Here are some popular editors:

## Installing and using a text editor

We would like you to try using and/or installing a text editor of your choice. Your computer may already be installed with one of the editors suggested above (e.g., Gedit if you use GNOME desktop, Kate if you use KDE etc.), if not then you should try installing one or more text editors of your choosing.

Try digging through the settings of your editor and read the manual or documentation to see what its capabilities are. In particular (if possible in your editor), try to:

- Change syntax highlighting settings and colors
- Play with [indentation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_(typesetting)#Indentation_in_programming>) width, setting it to an appropriate setting for your needs
- Check autosave and session saving settings
- Configure any available [plugins](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing)>) and investigate how to get new ones
- Change color schemes
- Adjust view settings and see how you can change the layout of the views
- Check what programming languages/technologies your editor supports

While you're learning the default settings of most text editors should be fine to use, but it is important to become familiar with your chosen tools, so you can select the best one for your usage. You will learn more about customizing your editors and tools as you gain experience, and more importantly you will learn what features are more useful to your purposes.

### Choice criteria

So, in more detail, what should you be thinking about when you choose a text editor?

#### Which OS (operating system) do I want to work with?

Of course it's your choice. However, some editors are only available for certain OSs, so if you like switching back and forth, that would narrow down the possibilities. Any text editor _can_ get the job done, if it runs on your system, but a cross-platform editor eases migration from OS to OS.

So first find out which OS you're using, and then check if a given editor supports your OS. Most editors specify on their website whether they support Windows or Mac, though some editors only support certain versions. If you're running Ubuntu, your best bet is to search within the Ubuntu Software Center. In general, of course, the Linux/UNIX world is a pretty diverse place where different distros work with different, incompatible packaging systems. That means, if you've set your heart on an obscure text editor, you may have to compile it from source yourself (not for the faint-hearted).

#### What kind of technologies do I want to manipulate?

Generally speaking, any text editor can open any text file. That works great for writing notes to yourself, but when you're doing web development and writing in {{Glossary("HTML")}}, {{Glossary("CSS")}}, and {{Glossary("JavaScript")}}, you can produce some pretty large, complex files. Make it easier on yourself by choosing a text editor that understands the technologies you're working with. Many text editors help you out with features like:

- **[Syntax highlighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting).** Make your file more legible by color-coding keywords based on the technology you're using.
- **[Code completion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocomplete#In_source_code_editors).** Save you time by auto-completing recurring structures (for example, automatically close HTML tags, or suggesting valid values for a given CSS property).
- **[Code snippets](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snippet_(programming)>).** As you saw when starting a new HTML document, many technologies use the same document structure over and over. Save yourself the hassle of retyping all this by using a code snippet to pre-fill your document.

Most text editors now support syntax highlighting, but not necessarily the other two features. Make sure in particular that your text editor supports highlighting for {{Glossary("HTML")}}, {{Glossary("CSS")}}, and {{Glossary("JavaScript")}}.

#### What kind of basic features do I expect from my text editor?

It depends on your needs and plans. These functionalities are often helpful:

- Search-and-replace, in one or multiple documents, based on {{Glossary("Regular Expression", "regular expressions")}} or other patterns as needed
- Quickly jump to a given line
- View two parts of a large document separately
- View HTML as it will look in the browser
- Select text in multiple places at once
- View your project's files and directories
- Format your code automatically with code beautifier
- Check spelling
- Auto-indent code based on indentation settings

#### Do I want to add extra features to my text editor?

An extensible editor comes with fewer built-in features, but can be extended based on your needs.

If you aren't sure which features you want, or your favorite editor lacks those features out of the box, look for an extensible editor. The best editors provide many plugins, and ideally a way to look for and install new plugins automatically.

If you like _lots_ of features and your editor is slowing down because of all your plugins, try using an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) (integrated development environment). An IDE provides many tools in one interface and it's a bit daunting for beginners, but always an option if your text editor feels too limited. Here are some popular IDEs:

- [Aptana Studio](https://www.axway.com/en/aptana)
- [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/)
- [NetBeans IDE](https://netbeans.apache.org/)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)

#### Do I need support/help while using my text editor?

It's always good to know if you can get help or not when using software. For text editors, check for two different kinds of support:

1. User-oriented content (FAQ, manual, online help)
2. Discussion with developers and other users (forum, email, IRC)

Use the written documentation when you're learning how to use the editor. Get in touch with other users if you're troubleshooting while installing or using the editor.

#### Does my text editor's look-and-feel matter to me?

Well, that's a matter of taste, but some people like customizing every bit of the UI (user interface), from colors to button positions. Editors vary widely in flexibility, so check beforehand. It's not hard to find a text editor that can change color scheme, but if you want hefty customizing you may be better off with an IDE.

### Install and set up

Installing a text editor is usually quite straightforward. The method varies based on your platform but it shouldn't be too hard:

- **Windows.** The developers will give you an `.exe` or `.msi` file. Sometimes the software comes in a compressed archive like `.zip`, `.7z`, or `.rar`, and in that case you'll need to install an additional program to extract the content from the archive. Windows supports `.zip` by default.
- **Mac.** On the editor's website you can download a `.dmg` file. Some text editors you can find directly in the Apple Store to make installation even simpler.
- **Linux.** In the most popular distros you can start with your graphical package manager (Ubuntu Software Center, mintInstall, GNOME Software, \&c.). You can often find a `.deb` or `.rpm` file for prepackaged software, but most of the time you'll have to use your distro's repository server or, in worst case scenario, compile your editor from source. Take the time to carefully check the installation instructions on the text editor's website.

When you install a new text editor, your OS will probably continue to open text files with its default editor until you change the _[file association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_association)._ These instructions will help you specify that your OS should open files in your preferred editor when you double-click them:

- [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows)

- [macOS](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/choose-an-app-to-open-a-file-on-mac-mh35597/mac)

- Linux
  - [Ubuntu Unity](https://askubuntu.com/questions/289337/how-can-i-change-file-association-globally)
  - [GNOME](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/files-open.html.en)
  - [KDE](https://userbase.kde.org/System_Settings/File_Associations)

## Next steps

Now that you have a good text editor, you could take some time to finalize [your basic working environment](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/set_up_a_local_testing_server), or, if you want to play with it right away, write [your very first web page](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website).

So you've published your website online? Very good! But are you sure it works properly?

A distant web server often behaves quite differently from a local one, so it's a good idea to test your website once it's online. You might be surprised at how many problems come up: images don't show up, pages don't load or load slowly, and so on. Most of the time it's no big deal, just a simple mistake or an issue with your web hosting configuration.

Let's see how to diagnose and solve those problems.

## Dig deeper

### Test in your browser

If you want to know whether your website works correctly, the first thing to do is fire up your browser and go to the page you want to test.

#### Uh-oh, where's the image?

Let's look at our personal website, `http://demozilla.examplehostingprovider.net/`. It's not showing the image we expected!

![Oops, the 'unicorn' image is missing](image-missing.png)

Open Firefox's Network tool (**Tools ➤ Web Developer ➤ Network**) and reload the page:

![The image has a 404 error](error404.png)

There's the problem, that "404" at the bottom. "404" means "resource not found", and that's why we didn't see the image.

#### HTTP statuses

Servers respond with a status message whenever they receive a request. Here are the most common statuses:

- **200: OK**
  - : The resource you asked for was delivered.
- **301: Moved permanently**
  - : The resource has moved to a new location. You won't see this much in your browser, but it's good to know about "301" since search engines use this information a lot to update their indexes.
- **304: Not modified**
  - : The file has not changed since the last time you asked for it, so your browser can display the version from its cache, resulting in faster response times and more efficient use of bandwidth.
- **403: Forbidden**
  - : You aren't allowed to display the resource. Usually it has to do with a configuration mistake (e.g., your hosting provider forgot to give you access rights to a directory).
- **404: Not found**
  - : Self-explanatory. We'll discuss how to solve this below.
- **500: Internal server error**
  - : Something went wrong on the server. For instance, maybe the server-side language ({{Glossary("PHP")}}, .Net, etc.) stopped working, or the web server itself has a configuration problem. Usually it's best to resort to your hosting provider's support team.
- **503: Service unavailable**
  - : Usually resulting from a short term system overload. The server has some sort of problem. Try again in a little while.

As beginners checking our (simple) website, we'll deal most often with 200, 304, 403, and 404.

#### Fixing the 404

So what went wrong?

![Le list of images in our project](demozilla-images-list.png)

At first glance, the image we asked for seems to be in the right place but the Network tool reported a "404". It turns out that we made a typo in our HTML code: `unicorn_pics.png` rather than `unicorn_pic.png`. So correct the typo in your code editor by changing the image's `src` attribute:

![Deleting the 's'](code-correct.png)

Save, [push to the server](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/Upload_files_to_a_web_server), and reload the page in your browser:

![The image loads correctly in the browser](image-corrected.png)

There you go! Let's look at the {{Glossary("HTTP")}} statuses again:

- **200** for `/` and for `unicorn_pic.png` means that we succeeded in reloading the page and the image.
- **304** for `basic.css` means that this file has not changed since the last request, so the browser can use the file in its cache rather than receiving a fresh copy.

So we fixed the error and learned a few HTTP statuses along the way!

### Frequent errors

The most frequent errors that we find are these:

#### Typos in the address

We wanted to type `http://demozilla.examplehostingprovider.net/` but typed too fast and forgot an "l":

![Address unreachable](cannot-find-server.png)

The address cannot be found. Indeed.

#### 404 errors

Many times the error results just from a typo, but sometimes maybe you either forgot to upload a resource or you lost your network connection while you were uploading your resources. First check the spelling and accuracy of the file path, and if there's still a problem, upload your files again. That will likely fix the problem.

#### JavaScript errors

Someone (possibly you) added a script to the page and made a mistake. This will not prevent the page from loading, but you will feel something went wrong.

Open the console (**Tools ➤ Web developer ➤ Web Console**) and reload the page:

![A JavaScript error is shown in the Console](js-error.png)

In this example, we learn (quite clearly) what the error is, and we can go fix it (we will cover JavaScript in [another series](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting) of articles).

### More things to check

We have listed a few simple ways to check that your website works properly, as well as the most common errors you may run across and how to fix them. You can also test if your page meets these criteria:

#### How's the performance?

Does the page load fast enough? Resources like [WebPageTest.org](https://www.webpagetest.org/) or browser add-ons like [YSlow](https://github.com/marcelduran/yslow) can tell you a few interesting things:

![Yslow diagnostics](yslow-diagnostics.png)

Grades go from A to F. Our page is just small and meets most criteria. But we can already note it would have been better to use a {{Glossary("CDN")}}. That doesn't matter very much when we're only serving one image, but it would be critical for a high-bandwidth website serving many thousands of images.

#### Is the server responsive enough?

`ping` is a useful shell tool that tests the domain name you provide and tells you if the server's responding or not:

```plain
$ ping mozilla.org
PING mozilla.org (63.245.215.20): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 63.245.215.20: icmp_seq=0 ttl=44 time=148.741 ms
64 bytes from 63.245.215.20: icmp_seq=1 ttl=44 time=148.541 ms
64 bytes from 63.245.215.20: icmp_seq=2 ttl=44 time=148.734 ms
64 bytes from 63.245.215.20: icmp_seq=3 ttl=44 time=147.857 ms
^C
--- mozilla.org ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 147.857/148.468/148.741/0.362 ms
```

Just keep in mind a handy keyboard shortcut: **Ctrl+C**. Ctrl+C sends an "interrupt" signal to the runtime and tells it to stop. If you don't stop the runtime, `ping` will ping the server indefinitely.

### A simple checklist

- Check for 404s
- Make sure all webpages are behaving as you expect
- Check your website in several browsers to make sure it renders consistently

## Next steps

Congratulations, your website is up and running for anyone to visit. That's a huge achievement. Now, you can start digging deeper into various subjects.

- Since people can come to your website from all over the world, you should consider making it [accessible to everybody](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Design_and_accessibility/What_is_accessibility).
- Is the design of your website a bit too rough? It's time to [learn more about CSS](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics).

## Summary

When launching a website, you may spend nothing, or your costs may go through the roof. In this article we discuss how much everything costs, and how you get what you pay (or don't pay).

## Software

### Text editors

You likely have a text editor: such as, Notepad on Windows, Gedit on Linux, TextEdit on Mac. You'll have an easier time writing code if you choose an editor that color-codes, checks your syntax, and assists you with code structure.

Many editors are free, for example [Brackets](https://brackets.io/), [Bluefish](https://bluefish.openoffice.nl/index.html), [TextWrangler](https://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/), and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Some, like [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), you can test as long as you like, but you're encouraged to pay. Some, like [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/), can cost between a few dozen and 200 dollars, depending on the plan you purchase. Some of them, like [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), can cost hundreds, or thousands of dollars; though Visual Studio Community is free for individual developers or open source projects. Often, for-pay editors will have a trial version.

To start, we suggest trying out several editors, to get a sense of which works best for you. If you're only writing simple {{Glossary("HTML")}}, {{Glossary("CSS")}}, and {{Glossary("JavaScript")}}, go with a simple editor.

Price does not reliably reflect a text editor's quality or usefulness. You have to try it for yourself and decide if it meets your needs. For example, Sublime Text is cheap, but comes with many free plugins that can greatly extend its functionality.

### Image editors

Your system likely includes an image editor, or viewer: Paint on Windows, Eye of GNOME on Ubuntu, Preview on Mac. Those programs are relatively limited, you'll soon want a more robust editor to add layers, effects, and grouping.

Editors can be free ([GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/)), moderately expensive ([PaintShop Pro](https://www.paintshoppro.com/), less than $100), or several hundred dollars ([Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)).

You can use any of them, as they will have similar functionality, though some are so comprehensive you'll never use every feature. If at some point you need to exchange projects with other designers, you should find out what tools they're using. Editors can all export finished projects to standard file formats, but each editor saves ongoing projects in its own specialized format. Most of the images on the internet are copyrighted, so it is better to check the license of the file before you use it. Sites like [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) provide images under CC0 license, so you can use, edit and publish them even with modification for commercial use.

### Media editors

If you want to include video or audio into your website, you can either embed online services (for example YouTube, Vimeo, or Dailymotion), or include your own videos (see below for bandwidth costs).

For audio files, you can find free software ([Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/), [Wavosaur](https://www.wavosaur.com/)), or paying up to a few hundred dollars ([Sound Forge](https://www.magix.com/us/music-editing/sound-forge/), [Adobe Audition](https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html)). Likewise, video-editing software can be free ([PiTiVi](https://www.pitivi.org/), [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/) for Linux, [iMovie](https://support.apple.com/imovie) for Mac), less than $100 ([Adobe Premiere Elements](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-elements.html)), or several hundred dollars ([Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html), [Avid Media Composer](https://www.avid.com/media-composer), [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/)). The software you received with your digital camera may cover all your needs.

### Publishing tools

You also need a way to upload files: from your hard drive to a distant web server. To do that you should use a publishing tool such as an [(S)FTP client](/en-US/docs/Glossary/FTP), [RSync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync), or [Git/GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).

Each operating system includes an (S)FTP client, as part of its file manager. Windows Explorer, Nautilus (a common Linux file manager), and the Mac Finder all include this functionality. However, people often choose dedicated (S)FTP clients to display local or remote directories side-by-side and store server passwords.

If you want to install an (S)FTP client, there are several reliable and free options: for example, [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) for all platforms, [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) for Windows, [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) for Mac or Windows, [and more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FTP_server_software).

Because FTP is inherently insecure, you should make sure to use SFTP — the secure, encrypted version of FTP that most hosting sites you'll deal with these days will offer by default — or another secure solution like Rsync over SSH.

## Browsers

You either already have a browser or can get one for free. If necessary, download [Firefox](https://www.firefox.com/en-US/download/all/) or [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

## Web access

### Computer / modem

You need a computer. Costs can vary tremendously, depending on your budget, and where you live. To publish a barebones website, you only need a basic computer capable of launching an editor, and a Web browser, so the entry level can be quite low.

Of course, you'll need a more serious computer if you want to produce complicated designs, touch up photos, or produce audio and video files.

You need to upload content to a remote server (see _Hosting_ below), so you need a modem. Your {{Glossary("ISP")}} can rent Internet connectivity to you for a few dollars per month, though your budget might vary, depending on your location.

### ISP access

Make sure that you have sufficient {{Glossary("Bandwidth", "bandwidth")}}:

- Low-bandwidth access may be adequate to support a 'simple' website: reasonably-sized images, texts, some CSS and JavaScript. That will likely cost you a few dozen dollars, including the rent for the modem.
- On the other hand, you'll need a high-bandwidth connection, such as DSL, cable, or fiber access, if you want a more advanced website with hundreds of files, or if you want to deliver heavy video/audio files directly from your web server. It could cost the same as low-bandwidth access, upwards to several hundred dollars per month for more professional needs.

## Hosting

### Understanding bandwidth

Hosting providers charge you according to how much {{Glossary("Bandwidth", "bandwidth")}} your website consumes. This depends on how many people, and Web crawling robots, access your content during a given time, and how much server space your content takes up. This is why people usually store their videos on dedicated services such as YouTube, Dailymotion, and Vimeo. For example, your provider may have a plan that includes up to several thousand visitors per day, for "reasonable" bandwidth usage. Be careful, however as this is defined differently from one hosting provider to another. Keep in mind that reliable, paid, personal hosting can cost around ten to fifteen dollars per month.

> [!NOTE]
> There is no such thing as "unlimited" bandwidth. If you consume a huge amount of bandwidth, expect to pay a huge amount of money.

### Domain names

Your domain name has to be purchased through a domain name provider (a registrar). Your hosting provider may also be a registrar ([Ionos](https://www.ionos.com/), [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net/en-US) for instance are at the same time registrars and hosting providers). The domain name usually costs $5-15 per year. This cost varies depending on:

- Local obligations: some country top-level domain names are more costly, as different countries set different prices.
- Services associated with the domain name: some registrars provide spam protection by hiding your postal address and email address behind their own addresses: the postal address can be provided in care of the registrar, and your email address can be obscured via your registrar's alias.

### Do-it-yourself hosting vs. "packaged" hosting

When you want to publish a website, you could do everything by yourself: set up a database (if needed), Content Management System, or {{Glossary("CMS")}} (like [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [Dotclear](https://dotclear.org/), [spip](https://www.spip.net/en_rubrique25.html), etc.), upload pre-made or your own templates.

You could use your hosting provider's environment, for roughly ten to fifteen dollars per month, or subscribe directly to a dedicated hosting service with pre-packaged CMSs (e.g., [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/), [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/), [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/)). For the latter, you won't have to pay anything, but you may have less control over templating and other options.

### Free hosting vs. paid hosting

You might ask, why should I pay for my hosting when there are so many free services?

- You have more freedom when you pay. Your website is yours, and you can migrate seamlessly from one hosting provider to the next.
- Free hosting providers may add advertising to your content, beyond your control.

It is better to go for paid hosting rather than relying on free hosting, as it is possible to move your files easily and uptime is guaranteed by most paid sites. Most hosting providers give you a huge discount to start with.

Some people opt for a mixed approach. For example, their main blog on a paid host with a full domain name, and spontaneous, less strategic, content on a free host service.

## Professional website agencies and hosting

If you desire a professional website, you will likely ask a web agency to do it for you.

Here, costs depend on multiple factors, such as:

- Is this a simple website with a few pages of text? Or a more complex, thousand-pages-long website?
- Will you want to update it regularly? Or will it be a static website?
- Must the website connect to your company's IT structure to gather content (say, internal data)?
- Do you want some shiny new feature that is popular at the moment? At the time of writing, clients are seeking single pages with complex parallax.
- Will you need the agency to think up user stories or solve complex {{Glossary("UX")}} problems? For example, creating a strategy to engage users, or A/B testing to choose a solution among several ideas.

And for hosting you need to consider following choices:

- Do you want redundant servers, in case your server goes down?
- Is 95% reliability adequate, or do you need professional, around-the-clock service?
- Do you want high-profile, ultra-responsive dedicated servers, or can you cope with a slower, shared machine?

Depending on how you answer these questions, your site could cost thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars.

## Local files vs. remote files

Throughout most of the learning area, we tell you to just open your examples directly in a browser — this can be done by double-clicking the HTML file, dragging and dropping it into the browser window, or choosing _File_ > _Open…_ and navigating to the HTML file. There are many ways to achieve this.

If the web address path starts with `file://` followed by the path to the file on your local hard drive, a local file is being used. In contrast, if you view one of our examples hosted on GitHub (or an example on some other remote server), the web address will start with `http://` or `https://`, to show that the file has been received via HTTP.

## The problem with testing local files

Some examples won't run if you open them as local files. This can be due to a variety of reasons, the most likely being:

- **They feature asynchronous requests**. Some browsers (including Chrome) will not run async requests (see [Learn: Making network requests with JavaScript](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Network_requests)) if you just run the example from a local file. This is because of security restrictions (for more on web security, read [Website security](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side/First_steps/Website_security)).
- **They feature a server-side language**. Server-side languages (such as PHP or Python) require a special server to interpret the code and deliver the results.
- **They include other files**. Browsers commonly treat requests to load resources using the `file://` scheme as cross-origin requests.
  So if you load a local file that includes other local files, this may trigger a {{Glossary("CORS")}} error.

## Running a simple local HTTP server

To get around the problem of async requests, we need to test such examples by running them through a local web server.

### Using an extension in your code editor

If you only need HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and no server-side language, the easiest way may be to check for extensions in your code editor. As well as automating installation and set-up for your local HTTP server, they also integrate nicely with your code editors. Testing local files in an HTTP server may be one click away.

For VS Code, try out the following free extensions:

- [Live Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server)
- [Preview on Web Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yuichinukiyama.vscode-preview-server)

### Using Node.js

The Node.js [`http-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) module is an easy way to host HTML files in any directory.

To use the module:

1. Run the following commands to check if Node.js is already installed:

   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   npx -v
   ```

2. If Node.js is not installed, you need to install it. Follow the [download instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download) in the Node.js docs, then run the above commands again to check if the installation is successful.

3. Let's assume the directory is `/path/to/project`. Run the following command to start the server:

   ```bash
   npx http-server /path/to/project -o -p 9999
   ```

   This hosts all files in the `/path/to/project` directory on `localhost:9999`. The option `-o` will open the `index.html` page in a web browser. If `index.html` doesn't exist, then the directory is displayed instead.

### Using Python

Another way to achieve this is to use Python's `http.server` module.

> [!NOTE]
> Older versions of Python (up to version 2.7) provided a similar module named `SimpleHTTPServer`. Python 2 is already end-of-life so we recommend using Python 3.

To do this:

1. Run the following command to check if Python is already installed:

   ```bash
   python -V
   # If the above fails, try:
   python3 -V
   # Or, if the "py" command is available, try:
   py -3 -V
   ```

2. If Python is not installed, you need to install it. Follow the [download instructions](https://www.python.org/downloads/) in the Python docs (we also have more detailed explanations in our [Django tutorial](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side/Django/development_environment#installing_python_3)), then run the above commands again to check if the installation is successful.

3. If Python is set up, navigate to the directory that contains the website code you want to test, using the `cd` command.

   ```bash
   # include the directory name to enter it, for example
   cd Desktop
   # use two dots to jump up one directory level if you need to
   cd ..
   ```

4. Enter the command to start up the server in that directory:

   ```bash
   # On Windows, try "python -m http.server" or "py -3 -m http.server"
   python3 -m http.server
   ```

5. By default, this will run the contents of the directory on a local web server, on port 8000. You can go to this server by going to the URL `localhost:8000` in your web browser. Here you'll see the contents of the directory listed — click the HTML file you want to run.

> [!NOTE]
> If you already have something running on port 8000, you can choose another port by running the server command followed by an alternative port number, e.g., `python3 -m http.server 7800`. You can then access your content at `localhost:7800`.

## Running server-side languages locally

The best approach for working with server side languages, such as Python, PHP, or JavaScript, depends on the server-side language you are using, and whether you're working with a web framework or "stand-alone" code.

If you're working with a web framework, usually the framework will provide its own development server.
For example, the following languages/frameworks come with a development server:

- Python web frameworks, such as [Django](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side/Django), [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/), and [Pyramid](https://trypyramid.com/).
- Node/JavaScript frameworks such as [Express Web Framework (Node.js/JavaScript)](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side/Express_Nodejs)
- PHP has its own [built-in development server](https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php):

  ```bash
  cd path/to/your/php/code
  php -S localhost:8000
  ```

If you're not working directly with a server-side framework or a programming language that provides a development server, Python's `http.server` module can also be used to test server-side code written in languages such as Python, PHP, JavaScript, and so on, by invoking server-side Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts.
For examples of how to use this feature see [Execute a Script Remotely Through the Common Gateway Interface (CGI)](https://realpython.com/python-http-server/#execute-a-script-remotely-through-the-common-gateway-interface-cgi) in _How to Launch an HTTP Server in One Line of Python Code_ on realpython.com.

## Summary

If you have built a simple web page (see [HTML basics](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website/Creating_the_content) for an example), you will probably want to put it online, on a web server. In this article we'll discuss how to do that, using various available options such as SFTP clients, RSync and GitHub.

## SFTP

There are several SFTP clients out there. Our demo covers [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/), since it's free and available for Windows, macOS and Linux. To install FileZilla go to the [FileZilla downloads page](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client), click the big Download button, then install from the installer file in the usual way.

> [!NOTE]
> Of course there are lots of other options. See [Publishing tools](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/How_much_does_it_cost#publishing_tools) for more information.

Open the FileZilla application; you should see something like this:

![Screenshot of the user interface of FileZilla FTP application. Host input has focus.](filezilla-ui.png)

### Logging in

For this example, we'll suppose that our hosting provider (the service that will host our HTTP web server) is a fictitious company "Example Hosting Provider" whose URLs look like this: `mypersonalwebsite.examplehostingprovider.net`.

We have just opened an account and received this info from them:

> Congratulations for opening an account at Example Hosting Provider.
>
> Your account is: `demozilla`
>
> Your website will be visible at `demozilla.examplehostingprovider.net`
>
> To publish to this account, please connect through SFTP with the following credentials:
>
> - SFTP server: `sftp://demozilla.examplehostingprovider.net`
> - Username: `demozilla`
> - Password: `quickbrownfox`
> - Port: `5548`
> - To publish on the web, put your files into the `Public/htdocs` directory.

Let's first look at `http://demozilla.examplehostingprovider.net/` — as you can see, so far there is nothing there:

![Our demozilla personal website, seen in a browser: it's empty](demozilla-empty.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on your hosting provider, most of the time you'll see a page saying something like "This website is hosted by \[Hosting Service]." when you first go to your web address.

To connect your SFTP client to the distant server, follow these steps:

1. Choose _File > Site Manager…_ from the main menu.
2. In the _Site Manager_ window, press the _New Site_ button, then fill in the site name as **demozilla** in the provided space.
3. Fill in the SFTP server your host provided in the _Host:_ field.
4. In the _Logon Type:_ drop down, choose _Normal_, then fill in your provided username and password in the relevant fields.
5. Fill in the correct port and other information.

Your window should look something like this:

![Screenshot of default landing page of a fictitious website when the file directory is empty](site-manager.png)

Now press _Connect_ to connect to the SFTP server.

Note: Make sure your hosting provider offers SFTP (Secure FTP) connection to your hosting space. FTP is inherently insecure, and you shouldn't use it.

### Here and there: local and remote view

Once connected, your screen should look something like this (we've connected to an example of our own to give you an idea):

![SFTP client displaying website contents once it has been connected to the SFTP server. Local files are on the left. Remote files are on the right.](connected.png)

Let's examine what you're seeing:

- On the center left pane, you see your local files. Navigate into the directory where you store your website (e.g., `mdn`).
- On the center right pane, you see remote files. We are logged into our distant FTP root (in this case, `users/demozilla`)
- You can ignore the bottom and top panes for now. Respectively, these are a log of messages showing the connection status between your computer and the SFTP server, and a live log of every interaction between your SFTP client and the server.

### Uploading to the server

Our example host instructions told us "To publish on the web, put your files into the `Public/htdocs` directory." You need to navigate to the specified directory in your right pane. This directory is effectively the root of your website — where your `index.html` file and other assets will go.

Once you've found the correct remote directory to put your files in, to upload your files to the server you need to drag-and-drop them from the left pane to the right pane.

### Are they really online?

So far, so good, but are the files really online? You can double-check by going back to your website (e.g., `http://demozilla.examplehostingprovider.net/`) in your browser:

![Here we go: our website is live!](here-we-go.png)

And our website is live!

## Rsync

{{Glossary("Rsync")}} is a local-to-remote file synchronizing tool, which is generally available on most Unix-based systems (like macOS and Linux), but Windows versions exist too.

It is seen as a more advanced tool than SFTP, because by default it is used on the command line. A basic command looks like this:

```bash
rsync [-options] SOURCE user@x.x.x.x:DESTINATION
```

- `-options` is a dash followed by a one or more letters, for example `-v` for verbose error messages, and `-b` to make backups. You can see the full list at the [rsync man page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync) (search for "Options summary").
- `SOURCE` is the path to the local file or directory that you want to copy files over from.
- `user@` is the credentials of the user on the remote server you want to copy files over to.
- `x.x.x.x` is the IP address of the remote server.
- `DESTINATION` is the path to the location you want to copy your directory or files to on the remote server.

You'd need to get such details from your hosting provider.

For more information and further examples, see [How to Use Rsync to Copy/Sync Files Between Servers](https://www.atlantic.net/vps-hosting/how-to-use-rsync-copy-sync-files-servers/).

Of course, it is a good idea to use a secure connection, as with FTP. In the case of Rsync, you specify SSH details to make the connection over SSH, using the `-e` option. For example:

```bash
rsync [-options] -e "ssh [SSH DETAILS GO HERE]" SOURCE user@x.x.x.x:DESTINATION
```

You can find more details of what is needed at [How To Copy Files With Rsync Over SSH](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-copy-files-with-rsync-over-ssh).

### Rsync GUI tools

GUI tools are available for Rsync (for those who are not as comfortable using the command line). [Acrosync](https://acrosync.com/mac.html) is one such tool, and it is available for Windows and macOS.

Again, you would have to get the connection credentials from your hosting provider, but this way you'd have a GUI to enter them in.

## GitHub

GitHub allows you to publish websites via [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) (gh-pages).

We've covered the basics of using this in the [Publishing your website](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website/Publishing_your_website) article from our [Getting started with the Web](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website) guide, so we aren't going to repeat it all here.

However, it is worth knowing that you can also host a website on GitHub, but use a custom domain with it. See [Using a custom domain with GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) for a detailed guide.

## Other methods to upload files

The FTP protocol is one well-known method for publishing a website, but not the only one. Here are a few other possibilities:

- **Web interfaces**. An HTML interface acting as front-end for a remote file upload service. Provided by your hosting service.
- **{{Glossary("WebDAV")}}**. An extension of the {{Glossary("HTTP")}} protocol to allow more advanced file management.
# How do I use GitHub Pages?

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a "social coding" site. It allows you to upload code repositories for storage in the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) **version control system.** You can then collaborate on code projects, and the system is open-source by default, meaning that anyone in the world can find your GitHub code, use it, learn from it, and improve on it. You can do that with other people's code too! This article provides a basic guide to publishing content using GitHub's gh-pages feature.

## Publishing content

GitHub is a very important and useful community to get involved in, and Git/GitHub is a very popular [version control system](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) — most tech companies now use it in their workflow. GitHub has a very useful feature called [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which allows you to publish website code live on the Web.

### Basic GitHub setup

1. First of all, [install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your machine. This is the underlying version control system software that GitHub works on top of.
2. Next, [sign up for a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup). It's simple and easy.
3. Once you've signed up, log in to [github.com](https://github.com/) with your username and password.

### Preparing your code for upload

You can store any code you like in a GitHub repository, but to use the GitHub Pages feature to full effect, your code should be structured as a typical website, e.g., with the primary entry point being an HTML file called `index.html`.

The other thing you need to do before moving on is to initialize your code directory as a Git repository. To do this:

1. Point the command line to your `test-site` directory (or whatever you called the directory containing your website). For this, use the `cd` command (i.e., "**c**hange **d**irectory"). Here's what you'd type if you've put your website in a directory called `test-site` on your desktop:

   ```bash
   cd Desktop/test-site
   ```

2. When the command line is pointing inside your website directory, type the following command, which tells the `git` tool to turn the directory into a git repository:

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

#### An aside on command line interfaces

The best way to upload your code to GitHub is via the command line — this is a window where you type in commands to do things like create files and run programs, rather than clicking inside a user interface. It will look something like this:

![Terminal/command prompt opened. No command has been entered.](command-line.png)

> [!NOTE]
> You could also consider using a [Git graphical user interface](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) to do the same work, if you feel uncomfortable with the command line.

Every operating system comes with a command line tool:

- **Windows**: **Command Prompt** can be accessed by pressing the Windows key, typing _Command Prompt_, and choosing it from the list that appears. Note that Windows has its own command conventions differing from Linux and macOS, so the commands below may vary on your machine.
- **macOS**: **Terminal** can be found in _Applications > Utilities_.
- **Linux**: Usually you can pull up a terminal with _Ctrl + Alt + T_. If that doesn't work, look for **Terminal** in an app bar or menu.

This may seem a bit scary at first, but don't worry — you'll soon get the hang of the basics. You tell the computer to do something in the terminal by typing in a command and hitting Enter, as seen above.

### Creating a repo for your code

1. Next, you need to create a new repo for your files to go in. Click Plus (+) in the top right of the GitHub homepage, then choose _New Repository_.
2. On this page, in the _Repository name_ box, enter a name for your code repository, for example _my-repository_.
3. Also fill in a description to say what your repository is going to contain. Your screen should look like this:
   ![New repository page opened in browser, repository owner input and the repository name are filled, same for the optional description input. The public check-box is selected, the private check-box is not, same goes for the initialize this repository with a readme.](create-new-repo.png)
4. Click _Create repository_; this should bring you to the following page:
   ![The repository page is opened in browser, below the GitHub header composed of search bar and navigation links to the repository's pull request, issues and gist. Next to the navigation links, a bell notification and a link to your account. Below, the name of the owner's repository follow by a slash with the repository's name. Below a horizontal navigation bar composed of different tabs relating to your repository, the code tab selected displaying a documentation explaining how to create a repository or how to push from using command line.](github-repo.png)

### Uploading your files to GitHub

1. On the current page, you are interested in the section _…or push an existing repository from the command line_. You should see two lines of code listed in this section. Copy the whole of the first line, paste it into the command line, and press Enter. The command should look something like this:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/chrisdavidmills/my-repository.git
   ```

2. Next, type the following two commands, pressing Enter after each one. These prepare the code for uploading to GitHub, and ask Git to manage these files.

   ```bash
   git add --all
   git commit -m 'adding my files to my repository'
   ```

3. Finally, push the code up to GitHub by going to the GitHub web page you're on and entering into the terminal the second of the two commands we saw the _…or push an existing repository from the command line_ section:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. Now you need to turn GitHub pages on for your repository. To do this, from the homepage of your repository choose _Settings_, then select _Pages_ from the sidebar on the left. Underneath _Source_, choose the "main" branch. The page should refresh.
5. Go to the GitHub Pages section again, and you should see a line of the form "Your site is ready to be published at `https://xxxxxx`."
6. If you click on this URL, you should go to a live version of your example, provided the home page is called `index.html` — it goes to this entry point by default. If your site's entry point is called something else, for example `myPage.html`, you'll need to go to `https://xxxxxx/myPage.html`.

### Further GitHub knowledge

If you want to make more changes to your test site and upload those to GitHub, you need to make the change to your files just like you did before. Then, you need to enter the following commands (pressing Enter after each one) to push those changes to GitHub:

```bash
git add --all
git commit -m 'another commit'
git push
```

You can replace _another commit_ with a more suitable message to describe what change you just made.

We have barely scratched the surface of Git. To learn more, check out our [Git and GitHub](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Version_control) page.
# What are browser developer tools?

Every modern web browser includes a powerful suite of developer tools. These tools do a range of things, from inspecting currently-loaded HTML, CSS and JavaScript to showing which assets the page has requested and how long they took to load. This article explains how to use the basic functions of your browser's devtools.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you run through the examples below, open the [Beginner's example site](https://mdn.github.io/beginner-html-site-scripted/) that we built during the [Getting started with the Web](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website) article series. You should have this open as you follow the steps below.

## How to open the devtools in your browser

The devtools live inside your browser in a subwindow that looks roughly like this, depending on what browser you are using:

![Screenshot of a browser with developer tools open. The web page is displayed in the top half of the browser, the developer tools occupy the bottom half. There are three panels open in the developer tools: HTML, with the body element selected, a CSS panel showing styles blocks targeting the highlighted body, and a computed styles panel showing all the author styles; the browser styles checkbox is not checked.](devtools_63_inspector.png)

How do you pull it up? Three ways:

- **_Keyboard:_**
  - **Windows:** <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> or <kbd>F12</kbd>
  - **macOS:** <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>⌥</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd>

- **_Menu bar:_**
  - **Firefox:** _Menu (☰) ➤ More tools ➤ Web Developer Tools_
  - **Chrome:** _More tools ➤ Developer tools_
  - **Opera**: _Developer ➤ Developer tools_
  - **Safari:** _Develop ➤ Show Web Inspector._

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Safari developer tools are not enabled by default.
    > To enable them, go to _Safari ➤ Preferences ➤ Advanced_, and check the _Show Develop menu in menu bar_ or _Enable features for web developers_ checkbox.

- **_Context menu:_** Press-and-hold/right-click an item on a webpage (Ctrl-click on the Mac), and choose _Inspect Element_ from the context menu that appears. (_An added bonus:_ this method straight-away highlights the code of the element you right-clicked.)

![The firefox logo as a DOM element in an example website with a context menu showing. A context menu appears when any item on the web page is right-clicked. The last menu items is 'Inspect element'.](inspector_context.png)

## The Inspector: DOM explorer and CSS editor

The developer tools usually open by default to the inspector, which looks something like the following screenshot. This tool shows what the HTML on your page looks like at runtime, as well as what CSS is applied to each element on the page. It also allows you to instantly modify the HTML and CSS and see the results of your changes reflected live in the browser viewport.

![A test website is opened in a tab in the browser. The browser developer tools sub-window is open. The developer tools has several tabs. Inspector is one of those tabs. Inspector tab displays the HTML code of the website. An image tag is selected from the HTML code. This results in highlighting of the image corresponding to the selected tag in the website.](inspector_highlighted.png)

If you _don't_ see the inspector,

- **Firefox:** Select the **Inspector** tab.
- **Other browsers:** Select the **Elements** tab.

### Exploring the DOM inspector

For a start, right-click (Ctrl-click) an HTML element in the DOM inspector and look at the context menu. The available menu options vary among browsers, but the important ones are mostly the same:

![The browser developer tools sub-window is open. The inspector tab is selected. A link element is right-clicked from the HTML code available in the inspector tab. A context menu appears. The available menu options vary among browsers, but the important ones are mostly the same.](dom_inspector.png)

- **Delete Node** (sometimes _Delete Element_). Deletes the current element.
- **Edit as HTML** (sometimes _Add attribute_/_Edit text_). Lets you change the HTML and see the results on the fly. Very useful for debugging and testing.
- **:hover/:active/:focus**. Forces element states to be toggled on, so you can see what their styling would look like.
- **Copy/Copy as HTML**. Copy the currently selected HTML.
- Some browsers also have _Copy CSS Path_ and _Copy XPath_ available, to allow you to copy the CSS selector or XPath expression that would select the current HTML element.

Try editing some of your DOM now. Double-click an element, or right-click it and choose _Edit as HTML_ from the context menu. You can make any changes you'd like, but you cannot save your changes.

### Exploring the CSS editor

By default, the CSS editor displays the CSS rules applied to the currently selected element:

![Snippet of the CSS panel and the layout panel that can be seen adjacent to the HTML editor in the browser developer tools. By default, the CSS editor displays the CSS rules applied to the currently selected element in the HTML editor. The layout panel shows the box model properties of the selected element.](css_inspector.png)

These features are especially handy:

- The rules applied to the current element are shown in order of most-to-least-specific.
- Click the checkboxes next to each declaration to see what would happen if you removed the declaration.
- Click the little arrow next to each shorthand property to show the property's longhand equivalents.
- Click a property name or value to bring up a text box, where you can key in a new value to get a live preview of a style change.
- Next to each rule is the file name and line number the rule is defined in. Clicking that rule causes the dev tools to jump to show it in its own view, where it can generally be edited and saved.
- You can also click the closing curly brace of any rule to bring up a text box on a new line, where you can write a completely new declaration for your page.

You'll notice a number of clickable tabs at the top of the CSS Viewer:

- _Computed_: This shows the computed styles for the currently selected element (the final, normalized values that the browser applies).
- _Layout_: This shows the details for CSS [grid](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout) and [flexbox](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout) layout modes if the element you are inspecting uses them.
- _Fonts_: In Firefox and Safari, the _Fonts_ tab shows the fonts applied to the current element.

The _box model_ view visually represents the current element's box model, so you can see at a glance what padding, border and margin is applied to it, and how big its content is. In Firefox, this is located in the _Layout_ tab, and in other browsers it is in the _Computed_ tab.

In some browsers, the JavaScript details of the selected element can also be viewed in this panel. In Safari, these are unified under the _Node_ tab, but are in separate tabs in Chrome, Opera, and Edge.

- _Properties_: The {{Glossary("Property/JavaScript", "properties")}} of the element object.
- _Event Listeners_: The [events](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event) associated with the element.

## The JavaScript debugger

The JavaScript debugger allows you to watch the value of variables and set breakpoints, places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly.

It allows you to watch the value of variables and set breakpoints. A file with name 'example.js' is selected from the sources pane. A breakpoint is set at line number 18 of the file.](firefox_debugger.png)

To get to the debugger:

**Firefox**: Open the Developer tools and select the **Debugger** tab.
**Other browsers**: Open the Developer tools and select the **Sources** tab.

### Exploring the debugger

Each browser's JavaScript debugger is divided into three panes. The layout of these is somewhat different depending on the browser you are using; this guide uses Firefox as a reference.

#### File list

The first pane on the left contains the list of files associated with the page you are debugging. Select the file you want to work with from this list. Click on a file to select it and view its contents in the center pane of the Debugger.

![Snippet of the sources pane of the debugger tab in the browser developer tools. The files related to the current page that you are debugging are visible under the folder whose name is same as the url of the site that is open in the current browser tab.](file_list.png)

#### Source code

Set breakpoints where you want to pause execution. In the following image, the highlight on the number 18 shows that the line has a breakpoint set.

![Snippet of developer tools debugger panel with the breakpoint at line 18 highlighted.](source_code.png)

#### Watch expressions and breakpoints

The right-hand pane shows a list of the watch expressions you have added and breakpoints you have set.

In the image, the first section, **Watch expressions**, shows that the listItems variable has been added. You can expand the list to view the values in the array.

The next section, **Breakpoints**, lists the breakpoints set on the page. In example.js, a breakpoint has been set on the statement `listItems.push(inputNewItem.value);`

The final two sections only appear when the code is running.

The **Call stack** section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line. You can see that the code is in the function that handles a mouse click, and that the code is currently paused on the breakpoint.

The final section, **Scopes**, shows what values are visible from various points within your code. For example, in the image below, you can see the objects available to the code in the addItemClick function.

![Snippet of the sources pane of the debugger tab of the browser developer tools. In the call stack it shows the function that is called at Line 18, highlighting that a breakpoint is set at this line and showing the scope.](watch_items.png)

- [Safari Sources tab](https://webkit.org/web-inspector/sources-tab/)

## The JavaScript console

The JavaScript console is an incredibly useful tool for debugging JavaScript that isn't working as expected. It allows you to run lines of JavaScript against the page currently loaded in the browser, and reports the errors encountered as the browser tries to execute your code.

To access the console in any browser, open the developer tools and select the **Console** tab. This will give you a window like the following:

![The Console tab of the browser developer tools. Two JavaScript functions have been executed in the console. The user entered functions, and the console displayed the return values.](console_only.png)

To see what happens, try entering the following snippets of code into the console one by one (and then pressing Enter):

```js
alert("hello!");
```

```js
document.querySelector("html").style.backgroundColor = "purple";
```

```js
const loginImage = document.createElement("img");
loginImage.setAttribute(
  "src",
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/learning-area/master/html/forms/image-type-example/login.png",
);
document.querySelector("h1").appendChild(loginImage);
```

Now try entering the following incorrect versions of the code and see what you get.

```js-nolint example-bad
alert("hello!);
```

```js example-bad
document.cheeseSelector("html").style.backgroundColor = "purple";
```

```js example-bad
const loginImage = document.createElement("img");
banana.setAttribute(
  "src",
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/learning-area/master/html/forms/image-type-example/login.png",
);
document.querySelector("h1").appendChild(loginImage);
```

You'll start to see the kind of errors that the browser returns. Often these errors are fairly cryptic, but it should be pretty simple to figure these problems out!

## Summary

You can download most of the programs you need for web development for free. We'll provide a few links in this article.

You'll need tools to:

- Create and edit webpages
- Upload files to your web server
- View your website

Nearly all operating systems by default include a text editor and a browser, which you can use to view websites. As a result, you usually only need to acquire software for transferring files to your web server.

## Dig deeper

### Creating and editing webpages

To create and edit a website, you need a text editor. Text editors create and modify unformatted text files. Other formats, like **{{Glossary("RTF")}}**, let you add formatting, like bold or underline. Those formats are not suitable for writing web pages. You should put some thought into which text editor you use, since you'll be working with it extensively while you're building the website.

All desktop operating systems come with a basic text editor. These editors are all straightforward, but lack special features for webpage coding. If you want something a bit fancier, there are plenty of third-party tools available. Third-party editors often come with extra features, including syntax coloring, auto-completion, collapsible sections, and code search. Here is a short list of editors:

### Uploading files on the Web

When your website is ready for public viewing, you'll have to upload your webpages to your web server. You can buy space on a server from various providers (see [How much does it cost to do something on the web?](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/How_much_does_it_cost)). Once you settle on which provider to use, the provider will email you the access information, usually in the form of an SFTP URL, username, password, and other information needed to connect to their server. Bear in mind that (S)FTP is now somewhat old-fashioned, and other uploading systems are starting to become popular, such as [RSync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync) and [Git/GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).

> [!NOTE]
> FTP is inherently insecure. You should make sure your hosting provider allows use of a secure connection, e.g., SFTP or RSync over SSH.

Uploading files to a web server is a very important step while creating a website, so we cover it in detail in [a separate article](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/Upload_files_to_a_web_server). For now, here's a short list of free basic (S)FTP clients:

### Testing websites

There are [many web browsers available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_browsers). When you're developing a website you should test it at least with the following major browsers on both desktop and mobile platforms, to make sure your site works for most people:

- [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.firefox.com/en-US/)
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- [Apple Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/)

If you're targeting a specific group (e.g., technical platform or locale), you may have to test the site with additional browsers, like [UC Browser](https://www.ucweb.com/) or [Opera Mini](https://www.opera.com/mini).

Testing gets complicated because some browsers only run on certain operating systems. Notably, Apple Safari runs on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. It's best to take advantage of services like [Browsershots](https://www.browsershots.at/) or [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/). Browsershots creates screenshots of your website as it will look in various browsers. Browserstack gives you full remote access to virtual machines, so you can test your site in the most common environments and on different operating systems. Alternatively, you can set up your own virtual machines, but that takes some expertise.

See [Strategies for carrying out testing: Putting together a testing lab](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Testing/Testing_strategies#putting_together_a_testing_lab) for more information.

By all means run some tests on a real device, especially on real mobile devices. Mobile devices cost money, of course, so we recommend sharing devices across a team if you want to test on many platforms without spending too much. For scalable cloud access to real device testing, we'd also recommend taking a look at [App Live: BrowserStack's Interactive Mobile App Testing platform](https://www.browserstack.com/app-live).

# When and how to file bugs with browsers

Browsers are software, and like any software, they can have bugs. Sometimes, you may find that the website you're developing doesn't behave as expected, or as indicated by documentation, such as MDN or the specifications. This could indicate either a bug in your code, a bug in the documentation (let's hope not!), or a bug in the browser you're using to test your website. In this article, we'll discuss how to figure out which it is and how to file a bug if it turns out to be a problem in the browser.

## Whose bug is it?

Before filing a browser bug, you should confirm that it's actually a bug in the browser. The problem could come from one of four places: your code, the documentation, the browser, or the specification. It's important to rule out the other possibilities before reporting a bug to the browser. Generally, specifications are the most credible source of all; browsers and documentation both follow specifications, but can still have mistakes. As for your code...well, it's always good to re-check for typos and logic errors before assuming it's a browser bug.

### Creating a test case

The first step in identifying the source of the problem is to create a minimal test case that reproduces the bug. It should be small and standalone, preferably a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript, without external dependencies or unrelated code. This is useful for two reasons:

- It minimizes the possibility that the problem is caused by your own code or an external dependency.
- You need to provide one anyway if you want to discuss it with anyone—for example, when filing a bug.

For example, the following would be a good test case for a bug related to the {{cssxref(":autofill")}} pseudo-class. Note how we've stripped it down to the bare minimum, which means foregoing best practices like including the doctype, `<head>` and `<body>` tags, or labels for inputs. That's fine because the relevant code is still there.

```html
<style>
  :autofill {
    border: 3px solid darkorange;
  }
</style>
<input id="name" name="name" type="text" autocomplete="name" />
<input id="email" name="email" type="email" autocomplete="email" />
```

### Testing your code

You can either save your HTML code locally and [serve it through a testing server](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/set_up_a_local_testing_server), or you can use an online service like [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) or [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) to create a live demo.

The simplest way to test whether the problem is a browser bug is to open your test case in [multiple browsers](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Testing/Introduction). If you experience divergent behavior across browsers, it's more likely to be a browser bug.

> [!NOTE]
> There are other steps you can take to isolate the problem, such as testing in a private window, disabling extensions, or clearing the cache. You should try those as well before reporting the bug.

### Checking implementation status

Start by trusting the documentation and investigating the browser(s) whose behavior doesn't match it. Not all unexpected behaviors are bugs. Sometimes browsers may implement a feature or behavior that's not yet been merged into the specification, which, as a result, is less likely to be documented. Another possibility is that a feature is described in the specification but not yet implemented in any browser, which also means it may not be documented.

At this point, you should check more sources to determine the implementation story. Here are some places to look:

- **MDN's browser compatibility tables**: In the "Browser compatibility" section of our reference pages (for example, check [this section](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/basic-shape/shape#browser_compatibility) on the `shape()` CSS function page), you will find information about which browsers support a feature and to what extent. This may indicate that a feature is not implemented in your target browser, or that it's only partially implemented (that is, it has known bugs or limitations).
- **Specification repositories**: Standards bodies such as [WHATWG](https://github.com/whatwg) (for DOM, HTML, fetch, and more), [CSSWG](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts) (for CSS), and [TC39](https://github.com/tc39) (for JavaScript) all work publicly on GitHub. You can check if a specification was recently changed, or if there's an open issue about the feature you're testing.
- **Community forums**: The [MDN community](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels) is a great place to start, as are other web development forums. These are good places to ask questions about whether browsers haven't implemented something yet, or if there's a known bug.
- **Issue tracker for the browser you're testing**: If you find that an issue related to your problem has already been filed, that confirms the bug is real, and there's nothing else you need to do. In fact, we'll cover issue trackers next.

Of course, even if all browsers behave the same way, there could still be a bug in all of them, or maybe only a single browser is implementing the intended behavior. Documentation may be out-of-date or incorrect. To be sure, you should regard the specification as the source of truth (except for the rare case of browsers implementing things ahead of the specification). On every MDN reference page, you can find links to the relevant specifications in the "Specifications" section (see this [example](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/basic-shape/shape#specifications)). Read the specification to check what the behavior should be. Sometimes specifications can be difficult to understand, since they're intended for browser engineers, but try your best.

If it turns out that all browsers and the spec are consistent but MDN is wrong, consider [contributing](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Getting_started)!

## Browser bug trackers

Each browser has its own bug tracker where you can search for existing bugs and file new ones. The interface and process may feel slightly unfamiliar at first, but there are usually instructions. The following table lists the bug trackers for the major browsers:

| Browser         | Bug tracker                                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Apple Safari    | [WebKit Bugzilla](https://webkit.org/reporting-bugs/) |
| Google Chrome   | [Chromium Issues](https://issues.chromium.org/issues) |
| Mozilla Firefox | [Mozilla Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/)     |
| Opera           | [Opera Bug Wizard](https://bugs.opera.com/wizard/)    |

Search for existing bug reports before filing a new one. If you find an existing bug report that matches your issue, you can add a comment with your findings (for example, if you found a workaround, or if you have more information about the bug). However, don't add comments such as "I found this bug too", because they don't really add any value. If you can't find an existing bug, you can file a new one—someone will tell you if it's a duplicate.

When filing a new bug, make sure to include your minimal test case and any other information that the report form asks for—such as browser version, expected vs. actual results, and screenshots. Some bug trackers may also ask you to select a component or category for the bug, such as rendering or networking. The browser developers use these labels to organize work. If you're unsure what to choose, take your best guess–someone will re-assign it if needed.

## Filing bugs for non-browser software

If the bug is related to non-browser software that may integrate with the browser, you need to file the bug with the relevant software vendor. The following table lists some assistive technologies and where to file bugs for them:

| Software                                                                             | Where to file                                                                          |

## Summary

The **Internet** is the backbone of the Web, the technical infrastructure that makes the Web possible. At its most basic, the Internet is a large network of computers which communicate all together.

[The history of the Internet is somewhat obscure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet#History). It began in the 1960s as a US-army-funded research project, then evolved into a public infrastructure in the 1980s with the support of many public universities and private companies. The various technologies that support the Internet have evolved over time, but the way it works hasn't changed that much: Internet is a way to connect computers all together and ensure that, whatever happens, they find a way to stay connected.

## Deeper dive

### A simple network

When two computers need to communicate, you have to link them, either physically (usually with an [Ethernet cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_crossover_cable)) or wirelessly (for example with [Wi-Fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi) or [Bluetooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth) systems). All modern computers can sustain any of those connections.

> [!NOTE]
> For the rest of this article, we will only talk about physical cables, but wireless networks work the same.

![Two computers linked together](internet-schema-1.png)

Such a network is not limited to two computers. You can connect as many computers as you wish. But it gets complicated quickly. If you're trying to connect, say, ten computers, you need 45 cables, with nine plugs per computer!

![Ten computers all together](internet-schema-2.png)

To solve this problem, each computer on a network is connected to a special tiny computer called a _network switch_ (or _switch_ for short). This switch has only one job: like a signaler at a railway station, it makes sure that messages sent from a given computer arrive only at their target destination computer. To send a message to computer B, computer A sends the message to the switch, which in turn forwards the message to computer B — computer B doesn't get messages intended for other computers, and none of the messages for computer B reach other computers on the local area network.

Once we add a switch to the system, our network of 10 computers only requires 10 cables: a single plug for each computer and a switch with 10 plugs.

![Ten computers with a switch](internet-schema-3.png)

### A network of networks

So far so good. But what about connecting hundreds, thousands, billions of computers? Of course a single switch can't scale that far, but, if you read carefully, we said that a switch is a computer like any other, so what keeps us from connecting two switches together? Nothing, so let's do that.

![Two switches linked together](internet-schema-4.png)

You may imagine that we can connect switches together infinitely, to form a network like this:

![Switches linked to switches](internet-schema-5.png)

In reality, this leads to many engineering problems. The more switches a packet has to go through, the longer it takes to reach its destination. And you can't have just a tree of switches, because then a single switch failure may disconnect a large portion of devices. To solve this problem, we keep each local network as small as possible, and we connect these local networks using a separate device called a _router_. A router is a computer that knows how to forward messages between networks. The router is like a post office: when a packet arrives, it reads the recipient address and forwards the packet to the right recipient directly, without going through layers of relays.

Such a network comes very close to what we call the Internet. We just need the physical medium (cables) to connect all these routers. Luckily, such an infrastructure already existed prior to the Internet, and that's the telephone network. To connect our network to the telephone infrastructure, we need a special piece of equipment called a _modem_. This _modem_ turns the information from our network into information manageable by the telephone infrastructure and vice versa.

![A router linked to a modem](internet-schema-6.png)

Note that the commercial router in your home is likely a combination of a switch, a router, and a modem, all in one device.

So we are connected to the telephone infrastructure. The next step is to send the messages from our network to the network we want to reach. To do that, we will connect our network to an Internet Service Provider (ISP). An ISP is a company that manages some special _routers_ that are all linked together and can also access other ISPs' routers. So the message from our network is carried through the network of ISP networks to the destination network. The Internet consists of this whole infrastructure of networks.

![Full Internet stack](internet-schema-7.png)

### Finding computers

If you want to send a message to a computer, you have to specify which one. Thus any computer linked to a network has a unique address that identifies it, called an "IP address" (where IP stands for _Internet Protocol_). It's an address made of a series of four numbers separated by dots, for example: `192.0.2.172`.

That's perfectly fine for computers, but we human beings have a hard time remembering that sort of address. To make things easier, we can alias an IP address with a human-readable name called a _domain name_. For example (at the time of writing; IP addresses can change) `google.com` is the domain name used on top of the IP address `142.250.190.78`. So using the domain name is the easiest way for us to reach a computer over the Internet.

![Show how a domain name can alias an IP address](dns-ip.png)

### Internet and the web

As you might notice, when we browse the Web with a Web browser, we usually use the domain name to reach a website. Does that mean the Internet and the Web are the same thing? It's not that simple. As we saw, the Internet is a technical infrastructure which allows billions of computers to be connected all together. Among those computers, some computers (called _Web servers_) can send messages intelligible to web browsers. The _Internet_ is an infrastructure, whereas the _Web_ is a service built on top of the infrastructure. It is worth noting there are several other services built on top of the Internet, such as email and {{Glossary("IRC")}}.

### Intranets and Extranets

Intranets are _private_ networks that are restricted to members of a particular organization.
They are commonly used to provide a portal for members to securely access shared resources, collaborate and communicate.
For example, an organization's intranet might host web pages for sharing department or team information, shared drives for managing key documents and files,
portals for performing business administration tasks, and collaboration tools like wikis, discussion boards, and messaging systems.

Extranets are very similar to Intranets, except they open all or part of a private network to allow sharing and collaboration with other organizations.
They are typically used to safely and securely share information with clients and stakeholders who work closely with a business.
Often their functions are similar to those provided by an intranet: information and file sharing, collaboration tools, discussion boards, etc.

Both intranets and extranets run on the same kind of infrastructure as the Internet, and use the same protocols.
They can therefore be accessed by authorized members from different physical locations.

## Summary

Hyperlinks, usually called links, are a foundational concept behind the Web. To explain what links are, we need to step back to the very basics of Web architecture.

Back in 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, the Web's inventor, spoke of the three pillars on which the Web stands:

1. {{Glossary("URL")}}, an address system that keeps track of Web documents
2. {{Glossary("HTTP")}}, a transfer protocol to find documents when given their URLs
3. {{Glossary("HTML")}}, a document format allowing for embedded _hyperlinks_

As you can see in the three pillars, everything on the Web revolves around documents and how to access them. The Web's original purpose was to provide an easy way to reach, read, and navigate through text documents. Since then, the Web has evolved to provide access to images, videos, and binary data, but these improvements have hardly changed the three pillars.

Before the Web, it was quite hard to access documents and move from one to another. Being human-readable, URLs already made things easier, but it's hard to type a long URL whenever you want to access a document. This is where hyperlinks revolutionized everything. Links can correlate any text string with a URL, such that the user can instantly reach the target document by activating the link.

Links stand out from the surrounding text by being underlined and in blue text. Tap or click a link to activate it, or if you use a keyboard, press Tab until the link is in focus and hit Enter or Spacebar.

![Example of a basic display and effect of a link in a web page](link-1.png)

Links are the breakthrough that made the Web so useful and successful. In the rest of this article, we discuss the various types of links and their importance to modern Web design.

## Deeper dive

As we said, a link is a text string tied to a URL, and we use links to allow easy jumping from one document to another. That said, there are some nuances worth considering:

### Types of links

- Internal link
  - : A link between two webpages, where both webpages belong to the same website, is called an internal link. Without internal links, there's no such thing as a website (unless, of course, it's a one-page website).
- External link
  - : A link from your webpage to someone else's webpage. Without external links, there is no Web, since the Web is a network of webpages. Use external links to provide information besides the content available through your webpage.
- Incoming links
  - : A link from someone else's webpage to your site. It's the opposite of an external link. Note that you don't have to link back when someone links to your site.

When you're building a website, focus on internal links, since those make your site usable. Find a good balance between having too many links and too few. We'll talk about designing website navigation in another article, but as a rule, whenever you add a new webpage, make sure at least one of your other pages links to that new page. On the other hand, if your site has more than about ten pages, it's counter-productive to link to every page from every other page.

When you're starting out, you don't have to worry about external and incoming links as much, but they are very important if you want search engines to find your site (see below for more details).

### Anchors

Most links tie two webpages together. **Anchors** tie two sections of one document together. When you follow a link pointing to an anchor, your browser jumps to another part of the current document instead of loading a new document. However, you make and use anchors the same way as other links.

![Example of a basic display and effect of an anchor in a web page](link-2.png)

### Links and Search Engines

Links matter both to users and search engines. Every time search engines crawl a webpage, they index the website by following the links available on the webpage. Search engines not only follow links to discover the various pages of the website, but they also use the link's visible text to determine which search queries are appropriate for reaching the target webpage.

Links influence how readily a search engine will link to your site. The trouble is, it's hard to measure search engines' activities. Companies naturally want their sites to rank highly in search results. We know the following about how search engines determine a site's rank:

- A link's _visible text_ influences which search queries will find a given URL.
- The more _incoming links_ a webpage can boast of, the higher it ranks in search results.
- _External links_ influence the search ranking both of source and target webpages, but it is unclear by how much.

[SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) (search engine optimization) is the study of how to make websites rank highly in search results. Improving a website's use of links is one helpful SEO technique.

Now you'll want to set up some webpages with links.

- To get some more theoretical background, learn about [URLs and their structure](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_URL), since every link points to a URL.

## Summary

Domain names are a key part of the Internet infrastructure. They provide a human-readable address for any web server available on the Internet.

Any Internet-connected computer can be reached through a public {{Glossary("IP Address")}}, either an IPv4 address (e.g., `192.0.2.172`) or an IPv6 address (e.g., `2001:db8:8b73:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:1337`).

Computers can handle such addresses easily, but people have a hard time finding out who is running the server or what service the website offers. IP addresses are hard to remember and might change over time.

To solve all those problems we use human-readable addresses called domain names.

## Deeper dive

### Structure of domain names

A domain name has a simple structure made of several parts (it might be one part only, two, three…), separated by dots and **read from right to left**:

![Anatomy of the MDN domain name](structure.png)

Each of those parts provides specific information about the whole domain name.

- {{Glossary("TLD")}} (Top-Level Domain).
  - : TLDs tell users the general purpose of the service behind the domain name. The most generic TLDs (`.com`, `.org`, `.net`) don't require web services to meet any particular criteria, but some TLDs enforce stricter policies so it is clearer what their purpose is. For example:
    - Local TLDs such as `.us`, `.fr`, or `.se` can require the service to be provided in a given language or hosted in a certain country — they are supposed to indicate a resource in a particular language or country.
    - TLDs containing `.gov` are only allowed to be used by government departments.
    - The `.edu` TLD is only for use by educational and academic institutions.

    TLDs can contain special as well as latin characters. A TLD's maximum length is 63 characters, although most are around 2–3.

    The full list of TLDs is [maintained by ICANN](https://www.icann.org/en/contracted-parties/registry-operators/resources/list-of-top-level-domains).

- Label (or component)
  - : The labels are what follow the TLD. A label is a case-insensitive character sequence anywhere from one to sixty-three characters in length, containing only the letters `A` through `Z`, digits `0` through `9`, and the '-' character (which may not be the first or last character in the label). `a`, `97`, and `hello-strange-person-16-how-are-you` are all examples of valid labels.

    The label located right before the TLD is also called a _Secondary Level Domain_ (SLD).

    A domain name can have many labels (or components). It is not mandatory nor necessary to have 3 labels to form a domain name. For instance, [informatics.ed.ac.uk](https://informatics.ed.ac.uk/) is a valid domain name. For any domain you control (e.g., [mozilla.org](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/)), you can create "subdomains" with different content located at each, like [developer.mozilla.org](/), [support.mozilla.org](https://support.mozilla.org/), or [bugzilla.mozilla.org](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/).

### Buying a domain name

#### Who owns a domain name?

You cannot "buy a domain name". This is so that unused domain names eventually become available to be used again by someone else. If every domain name was bought, the web would quickly fill up with unused domain names that were locked and couldn't be used by anyone.

Instead, you pay for the right to use a domain name for one or more years. You can renew your right, and your renewal has priority over other people's applications. But you never own the domain name.

Companies called registrars use domain name registries to keep track of technical and administrative information connecting you to your domain name.

> [!NOTE]
> For some domain name, it might not be a registrar which is in charge of keeping track. For instance, every domain name under `.fire` is managed by Amazon.

#### Finding an available domain name

To find out whether a given domain name is available,

- Go to a domain name registrar's website. Most of them provide a "whois" service that tells you whether a domain name is available.
- Alternatively, if you use a system with a built-in shell, type a `whois` command into it, as shown here for `mozilla.org`:

  ```bash
  whois mozilla.org
  ```

  This will output the following:

  ```plain
  Domain Name:MOZILLA.ORG
  Domain ID: D1409563-LROR
  Creation Date: 1998-01-24T05:00:00Z
  Updated Date: 2013-12-08T01:16:57Z
  Registry Expiry Date: 2015-01-23T05:00:00Z
  Sponsoring Registrar:MarkMonitor Inc. (R37-LROR)
  Sponsoring Registrar IANA ID: 292
  WHOIS Server:
  Referral URL:
  Domain Status: clientDeleteProhibited
  Domain Status: clientTransferProhibited
  Domain Status: clientUpdateProhibited
  Registrant ID:mmr-33684
  Registrant Name:DNS Admin
  Registrant Organization:Mozilla Foundation
  Registrant Street: 650 Castro St Ste 300
  Registrant City:Mountain View
  Registrant State/Province:CA
  Registrant Postal Code:94041
  Registrant Country:US
  Registrant Phone:+1.6509030800
  ```

As you can see, I can't register `mozilla.org` because the Mozilla Foundation has already registered it.

On the other hand, let's see if I could register `afunkydomainname.org`:

```bash
whois afunkydomainname.org
```

This will output the following (at the time of writing):

```plain
NOT FOUND
```

As you can see, the domain does not exist in the `whois` database, so we could ask to register it. Good to know!

#### Getting a domain name

The process is quite straightforward:

1. Go to a registrar's website.
2. Usually there is a prominent "Get a domain name" call to action. Click on it.
3. Fill out the form with all required details. Make sure, especially, that you have not misspelled your desired domain name. Once it's paid for, it's too late!
4. The registrar will let you know when the domain name is properly registered. Within a few hours, all DNS servers will have received your DNS information.

> [!NOTE]
> In this process the registrar asks you for your real-world address. Make sure you fill it properly, since in some countries registrars may be forced to close the domain if they cannot provide a valid address.

#### DNS refreshing

DNS databases are stored on every DNS server worldwide, and all these servers refer to a few special servers called "authoritative name servers" or "top-level DNS servers" — these are like the boss servers that manage the system.

Whenever your registrar creates or updates any information for a given domain, the information must be refreshed in every DNS database. Each DNS server that knows about a given domain stores the information for some time before it is automatically invalidated and then refreshed (the DNS server queries an authoritative server and fetches the updated information from it). Thus, it takes some time for DNS servers that know about this domain name to get the up-to-date information.

### How does a DNS request work?

As we already saw, when you want to display a webpage in your browser it's easier to type a domain name than an IP address. Let's take a look at the process:

1. Type `mozilla.org` in your browser's location bar.
2. Your browser asks your computer if it already recognizes the IP address identified by this domain name (using a local DNS cache). If it does, the name is translated to the IP address and the browser negotiates contents with the web server. End of story.
3. If your computer does not know which IP is behind the `mozilla.org` name, it goes on to ask a DNS server, whose job is precisely to tell your computer which IP address matches each registered domain name.
4. Now that the computer knows the requested IP address, your browser can negotiate contents with the web server.

## Summary

A **URL** (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address of a unique resource on the internet. It is one of the key mechanisms used by {{Glossary("Browser","browsers")}} to retrieve published resources, such as HTML pages, CSS documents, images, and so on.

In theory, each valid URL points to a unique resource. In practice, there are some exceptions, the most common being a URL pointing to a resource that no longer exists or that has moved. As the resource represented by the URL and the URL itself are handled by the Web server, it is up to the owner of the web server to carefully manage that resource and its associated URL.

## Basics: anatomy of a URL

Here are some examples of URLs:

```plain
https://developer.mozilla.org
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/search?q=URL
```

Any of those URLs can be typed into your browser's address bar to tell it to load the associated resource, which in all three cases is a Web page.

A URL is composed of different parts, some mandatory and others optional. The most important parts are highlighted on the URL below (details are provided in the following sections):

![full URL](mdn-url-all.png)

> [!NOTE]
> You might think of a URL like a regular postal mail address: the _scheme_ represents the postal service you want to use, the _domain name_ is the city or town, and the _port_ is like the zip code; the _path_ represents the building where your mail should be delivered; the _parameters_ represent extra information such as the number of the apartment in the building; and, finally, the _anchor_ represents the actual person to whom you've addressed your mail.

> [!NOTE]
> There are [some extra parts and some extra rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator) regarding URLs, but they are not relevant for regular users or Web developers. Don't worry about this, you don't need to know them to build and use fully functional URLs.

## Scheme

![Scheme](mdn-url-protocol@x2_update.png)

The first part of the URL is the _scheme_, which indicates the protocol that the browser must use to request the resource (a protocol is a set method for exchanging or transferring data around a computer network). Usually for websites the protocol is HTTPS or HTTP (its unsecured version). Addressing web pages requires one of these two, but browsers also know how to handle other schemes such as `mailto:` (to open a mail client), so don't be surprised if you see other protocols.

## Authority

![Authority](mdn-url-authority.png)

Next follows the _authority_, which is separated from the scheme by the character pattern `://`. If present the authority includes both the _domain_ (e.g., `www.example.com`) and the _port_ (`80`), separated by a colon:

- The domain indicates which Web server is being requested. Usually this is a [domain name](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_domain_name), but an {{Glossary("IP address")}} may also be used (but this is rare as it is much less convenient).
- The port indicates the technical "gate" used to access the resources on the web server. It is usually omitted if the web server uses the standard ports of the HTTP protocol (80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS) to grant access to its resources. Otherwise it is mandatory.

> [!NOTE]
> The separator between the scheme and authority is `://`. The colon separates the scheme from the next part of the URL, while `//` indicates that the next part of the URL is the authority.
>
> One example of a URL that doesn't use an authority is the mail client (`mailto:foobar`). It contains a scheme but doesn't use an authority component. Therefore, the colon is not followed by two slashes and only acts as a delimiter between the scheme and mail address.

## Path to resource

![Path to the file](mdn-url-path@x2.png)

`/path/to/myfile.html` is the path to the resource on the Web server. In the early days of the Web, a path like this represented a physical file location on the Web server. Nowadays, it is mostly an abstraction handled by Web servers without any physical reality.

## Parameters

![Parameters](mdn-url-parameters@x2.png)

`?key1=value1&key2=value2` are extra parameters provided to the Web server. Those parameters are a list of key/value pairs separated with the `&` symbol. The Web server can use those parameters to do extra stuff before returning the resource. Each Web server has its own rules regarding parameters, and the only reliable way to know if a specific Web server is handling parameters is by asking the Web server owner.

## Anchor

![Anchor](mdn-url-anchor@x2.png)

`#SomewhereInTheDocument` is an anchor to another part of the resource itself. An anchor represents a sort of "bookmark" inside the resource, giving the browser the directions to show the content located at that "bookmarked" spot. On an HTML document, for example, the browser will scroll to the point where the anchor is defined; on a video or audio document, the browser will try to go to the time the anchor represents. It is worth noting that the part after the **#**, also known as the **fragment identifier**, is never sent to the server with the request.

## How to use URLs

Any URL can be typed right inside the browser's address bar to get to the resource behind it. But this is only the tip of the iceberg!

The {{Glossary("HTML")}} language (see [Structuring content with HTML](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content)) makes extensive use of URLs:

- to create links to other documents with the {{HTMLElement("a")}} element;
- to link a document with its related resources through various elements such as {{HTMLElement("link")}} or {{HTMLElement("script")}};
- to display media such as images (with the {{HTMLElement("img")}} element), videos (with the {{HTMLElement("video")}} element), sounds and music (with the {{HTMLElement("audio")}} element), etc.;
- to display other HTML documents with the {{HTMLElement("iframe")}} element.

> [!NOTE]
> When specifying URLs to load resources as part of a page (such as when using the `<script>`, `<audio>`, `<img>`, `<video>`, and the like), you should generally only use HTTP and HTTPS URLs, with few exceptions (one notable one being `data:`; see [Data URLs](/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Schemes/data)). Using FTP, for example, is not secure and is no longer supported by modern browsers.

Other technologies, such as {{Glossary("CSS")}} or {{Glossary("JavaScript")}}, use URLs extensively, and these are really the heart of the Web.

## Absolute URLs vs. relative URLs

What we saw above is called an _absolute URL_, but there is also something called a _relative URL_. The [URL standard](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#absolute-url-string) defines both — though it uses the terms [_absolute URL string_](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#absolute-url-string) and [_relative URL string_](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#relative-url-string), to distinguish them from [URL objects](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url) (which are in-memory representations of URLs).

Let's examine what the distinction between _absolute_ and _relative_ means in the context of URLs.

The required parts of a URL depend to a great extent on the context in which the URL is used. In your browser's address bar, a URL doesn't have any context, so you must provide a full (or _absolute_) URL, like the ones we saw above. You don't need to include the protocol (the browser uses HTTP by default) or the port (which is only required when the targeted Web server is using some unusual port), but all the other parts of the URL are necessary.

When a URL is used within a document, such as in an HTML page, things are a bit different. Because the browser already has the document's own URL, it can use this information to fill in the missing parts of any URL available inside that document. We can differentiate between an _absolute URL_ and a _relative URL_ by looking only at the _path_ part of the URL. If the path part of the URL starts with the `/` character, the browser will fetch that resource from the top root of the server, without reference to the context given by the current document.

Let's look at some examples to make this clearer. Let's assume that the URLs are defined from within the document located at the following URL: `https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development`.

`https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development` itself is an absolute URL. It has all necessary parts needed to locate the resource it points to.

All of the following URLs are relative URLs:

- Scheme-relative URL: `//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development` — only the protocol is missing. The browser will use the same protocol as the one used to load the document hosting that URL.
- Domain-relative URL: `/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development` — the protocol and the domain name are both missing. The browser will use the same protocol and the same domain name as the one used to load the document hosting that URL.
- Sub-resources: `Howto/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_URL` — the protocol and domain name are missing, and the path doesn't begin with `/`. The browser will attempt to find the document in a subdirectory of the one containing the current resource. In this case, we really want to reach this URL: `https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_URL`.
- Going back in the directory tree: `../CSS/display` — the protocol and domain name are missing, and the path begins with `..`. This is inherited from the UNIX file system world — to tell the browser we want to go up by one level. Here we want to reach this URL: `https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/../Web/CSS/display`, which can be simplified to: `https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display`.
- Anchor-only: `#semantic_urls` - all parts are missing except the anchor. The browser will use the current document's URL and replace or add the anchor part to it. This is useful when you want to link to a specific part of the current document.

## URL usernames and passwords

Less common than the URL parts discussed above, you may see a username and password included in URLs.

For example:

```plain
https://username:password@www.example.com:80/
```

When included, the username and password are put between the `://` characters and the authority, with a colon between the two and an at sign (`@`) at the end.

A username and password can be included in the URL when accessing websites that use the [HTTP authentication](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Authentication) security mechanism, to immediately sign in to a website and bypass the username/password dialog box that would otherwise appear to enter your credentials into.

While you might still see this mechanism used in the wild, it is deprecated because of security concerns, and modern websites tend to use other mechanisms for authentication. See [Access using credentials in the URL](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Authentication#access_using_credentials_in_the_url) for more details.

## Semantic URLs

Despite their very technical flavor, URLs represent a human-readable entry point for a website. They can be memorized, and anyone can enter them into a browser's address bar. People are at the core of the Web, and so it is considered best practice to build what is called [_semantic URLs_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_URL). Semantic URLs use words with inherent meaning that can be understood by anyone, regardless of their technical know-how.

Linguistic semantics are of course irrelevant to computers. You've probably often seen URLs that look like mashups of random characters. But there are many advantages to creating human-readable URLs:

- It is easier for you to manipulate them.
- It clarifies things for users in terms of where they are, what they're doing, what they're reading or interacting with on the Web.
- Some search engines can use those semantics to improve the classification of the associated pages.

## Summary

The term _web server_ can refer to hardware or software, or both of them working together.

1. On the hardware side, a web server is a computer that stores web server software and a website's component files (for example, HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files). A web server connects to the Internet and supports physical data interchange with other devices connected to the web.
2. On the software side, a web server includes several parts that control how web users access hosted files. At a minimum, this is an _HTTP server_. An HTTP server is software that understands {{Glossary("URL","URLs")}} (web addresses) and {{Glossary("HTTP")}} (the protocol your browser uses to view webpages). An HTTP server can be accessed through the domain names of the websites it stores, and it delivers the content of these hosted websites to the end user's device.

At the most basic level, whenever a browser needs a file that is hosted on a web server, the browser requests the file via HTTP. When the request reaches the correct (hardware) web server, the (software) _HTTP server_ accepts the request, finds the requested document, and sends it back to the browser, also through HTTP. (If the server doesn't find the requested document, it returns a [404](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/404) response instead.)

![Basic representation of a client/server connection through HTTP](web-server.svg)

To publish a website, you need either a static or a dynamic web server.

A **static web server**, or stack, consists of a computer (hardware) with an HTTP server (software). We call it "static" because the server sends its hosted files as-is to your browser.

A **dynamic web server** consists of a static web server plus extra software, most commonly an _application server_ and a _database_. We call it "dynamic" because the application server updates the hosted files before sending content to your browser via the HTTP server.

For example, to produce the final webpages you see in the browser, the application server might fill an HTML template with content from a database. Sites like MDN or Wikipedia have thousands of webpages. Typically, these kinds of sites are composed of only a few HTML templates and a giant database, rather than thousands of static HTML documents. This setup makes it easier to maintain and deliver the content.

## Deeper dive

To review: to fetch a webpage, your browser sends a request to the web server, which searches for the requested file in its own storage space. Upon finding the file, the server reads it, processes it as needed, and sends it to the browser. Let's look at those steps in more detail.

### Hosting files

First, a web server has to store the website's files, namely all HTML documents and their related assets, including images, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, fonts, and video.

Technically, you could host all those files on your own computer, but it's far more convenient to store files all on a dedicated web server because:

- A dedicated web server is typically more available (up and running).
- Excluding downtime and system troubles, a dedicated web server is always connected to the Internet.
- A dedicated web server can have the same IP address all the time. This is known as a _dedicated IP address_. (Not all {{Glossary("ISP", "ISPs")}} provide a fixed IP address for home lines.)
- A dedicated web server is typically maintained by a third party.

For all these reasons, finding a good hosting provider is a key part of building your website. Examine the various services companies offer. Choose one that fits your needs and budget. (Services range from free to thousands of dollars per month.) You can find more details [in this article](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/How_much_does_it_cost#hosting).

Once you have web hosting service, you must [upload your files to your web server](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/Upload_files_to_a_web_server).

### Communicating through HTTP

Second, a web server provides support for {{Glossary("HTTP")}} (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). As its name implies, HTTP specifies how to transfer hypertext (linked web documents) between two computers.

A {{Glossary("Protocol")}} is a set of rules for communication between two computers. HTTP is a textual, stateless protocol.

- Textual
  - : All commands are plain-text and human-readable.
- Stateless
  - : Neither the server nor the client remember previous communications. For example, relying on HTTP alone, a server can't remember a password you typed or remember your progress on an incomplete transaction. You need an application server for tasks like that. (We'll cover that sort of technology in other articles.)

HTTP provides clear rules for how a client and server communicate.
If you want to learn more, you can read the [HTTP documentation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP).
For now, there are a few things to keep in mind:

- _Clients_ make HTTP requests to _servers_. Servers _respond_ to a _client_'s HTTP request.
- When requesting a file via HTTP, clients must provide the file's {{Glossary("URL")}}.
- The web server _must answer_ every HTTP request, at least with an error message.

On a web server, the HTTP server is responsible for processing and answering incoming requests.

1. Upon receiving a request, an HTTP server checks if the requested URL matches an existing file.
2. If so, the web server sends the file content back to the browser. If not, the server will check if it should generate a file dynamically for the request (see [Static vs. dynamic content](#static_vs._dynamic_content)).
3. If neither of these options are possible, the web server returns an error message to the browser, most commonly {{HTTPStatus("404", "404 Not Found")}}.
   The 404 error is so common that some web designers devote considerable time and effort to designing 404 error pages.
   ![The MDN 404 page as an example of such error page](mdn-404.jpg)

### Static vs. dynamic content

Roughly speaking, a server can serve either static or dynamic content. Remember that the term _static_ means "served as-is". Static websites are the easiest to set up, so we suggest you make your first site a static site.

The term _dynamic_ means that the server processes the content or even generates it on the fly from a database. This approach provides more flexibility, but the technical stack is more complex, making it dramatically more challenging to build a website.

It is impossible to suggest a single off-the-shelf application server that will be the right solution for every possible use case. Some application servers are designed to host and manage blogs, wikis, or e-commerce solutions, while others are more generic. If you're building a dynamic website, take the time to research your requirements and find the technology that best fits your needs.

Most website developers won't need to create an application server from scratch, because there are so many off-the-shelf solutions, many of which are highly configurable.
But if you do need to create your own server, then you will probably want to use a server framework, leveraging its existing code and libraries, and extending just the parts that you need in order to meet your use case.
Only a relatively small number of developers should need to develop a server completely from scratch: for example, in order to meet tight resource constraints on an embedded system.
If you'd like to experiment with building a server, take a look through the resources in the [Server-side website programming](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side) learning pathway.

## Test your skills

Throughout the course, you'll find several articles designed to help you assess whether you have understood what we are teaching you in the course. There are two types:

- "Test your skills" articles occur more frequently, and test your knowledge of a single isolated feature such as HTML links, the CSS box model, or JavaScript functions.
- "Challenges" occur less frequently, and test your ability to use several features together to create a complete website or program of some kind.

Most of the questions feature HTML/CSS/JavaScript code blocks that show the starting code for each task. The recommended way to complete each one is to press the **"Play"** button in one of the code blocks to open the example in the [MDN Playground](/en-US/play) and then edit the code according to the question instructions.

If you make a mistake, you can clear your work using the Reset button in the MDN Playground. If you get really stuck, you can (usually) view the solution at the bottom of each question section, or [reach out for help](#contact_us).

> [!NOTE]
> If you'd prefer to work in your own editor or in an online editor (such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/)), you can copy the code from the MDN Playground into your chosen environment.

Some questions don't include code blocks to start from, and instead ask you to download starter files to work on your local machine with. Sometimes this is due to the complex nature of the question, and sometimes we just wanted to change things up a bit.

# ARIA live regions

Using JavaScript, it is possible to dynamically change parts of a page without requiring the entire page to reload — for instance, to update a list of search results on the fly, or to display a discreet alert or notification which does not require user interaction. While these changes are usually visually apparent to users who can see the page, they may not be obvious to users of assistive technologies. ARIA live regions fill this gap and provide a way to programmatically expose dynamic content changes in a way that can be announced by assistive technologies.

> [!NOTE]
> Assistive technologies will generally only announce _dynamic_ changes in the content of a live region.
> Including an `aria-live` attribute or a specialized live region `role` (such as [`role="status"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/status_role)) on the element you want to announce changes to works as long as you add the attribute before the changes occur — either in the original markup, or dynamically using JavaScript. Start with an empty live region, then – in a separate step – change the content inside the region.
> While not explicitly documented in the specification, browsers/assistive technologies do include special handling for [`role="alert"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/alert_role): in most cases, the content inside `role="alert"` regions is announced, even when the region (which already contains the notification/message) is present in the initial markup of the page, or injected dynamically into the page. However, note that `role="alert"` regions are – depending on the specific browser/assistive technology combination – automatically prefixed with "Alert" when they are announced.

## Live regions

Dynamic content which updates without a page reload is generally either a region or a widget. Simple content changes which are not interactive should be marked as live regions. A live region is explicitly denoted using the `aria-live` attribute.

**`aria-live`**: The `aria-live=POLITENESS_SETTING` is used to set the priority with which screen reader should treat updates to live regions - the possible settings are: `off`, `polite` or `assertive`. This attribute is by far the most important.

Normally, only `aria-live="polite"` is used. Any region which receives updates that are important for the user to receive, but not so rapid as to be annoying, should receive this attribute. The screen reader will speak changes whenever the user is idle.

`aria-live="assertive"` should only be used for time-sensitive/critical notifications that absolutely require the user's immediate attention. Generally, a change to an assertive live region will interrupt any announcement a screen reader is currently making. As such, it can be extremely annoying and disruptive and should only be used sparingly.

Unintuitively, `aria-live="off"` does not indicate that changes should not be announced. When an element has `aria-live="off"` (or has a `role` with this implicit value, such as `role="marquee"` or `role="timer"`), changes to the element's content are only supposed to be announced when focus is on, or inside, the element.

### Basic example: Dropdown box updates useful onscreen information

A website specializing in providing information about planets provides a dropdown box. When a planet is selected from the dropdown, a region on the page is updated with information about the selected planet.

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>Planet information</legend>
  <label for="planetsSelect">Planet:</label>
  <select id="planetsSelect" aria-controls="planetInfo">
    <option value="">Select a planet…</option>
    <option value="mercury">Mercury</option>
    <option value="venus">Venus</option>
    <option value="earth">Earth</option>
    <option value="mars">Mars</option>
  </select>
  <button id="renderPlanetInfoButton">Go</button>
</fieldset>

<div role="region" id="planetInfo" aria-live="polite">
  <h2 id="planetTitle">No planet selected</h2>
  <p id="planetDescription">Select a planet to view its description</p>
</div>

<p>
  <small>
    Information from
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System">Wikipedia</a>
  </small>
</p>
```

```js
const PLANETS_INFO = {
  mercury: {
    title: "Mercury",
    description:
      "Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. It is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger to the gods.",
  },

  venus: {
    title: "Venus",
    description:
      "Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.",
  },

  earth: {
    title: "Earth",
    description:
      "Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life.",
  },

  mars: {
    title: "Mars",
    description:
      'Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury. In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman god of war, and is often referred to as the "Red Planet".',
  },
};

function renderPlanetInfo(planet) {
  const planetTitle = document.querySelector("#planetTitle");
  const planetDescription = document.querySelector("#planetDescription");

  if (planet in PLANETS_INFO) {
    planetTitle.textContent = PLANETS_INFO[planet].title;
    planetDescription.textContent = PLANETS_INFO[planet].description;
  } else {
    planetTitle.textContent = "No planet selected";
    planetDescription.textContent = "Select a planet to view its description";
  }
}

const renderPlanetInfoButton = document.querySelector(
  "#renderPlanetInfoButton",
);

renderPlanetInfoButton.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  const planetsSelect = document.querySelector("#planetsSelect");
  const selectedPlanet =
    planetsSelect.options[planetsSelect.selectedIndex].value;

  renderPlanetInfo(selectedPlanet);
});
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Basic_example_Dropdown_box_updates_useful_onscreen_information', '', 350)}}

As the user selects a new planet, the information in the live region will be announced. Because the live region has `aria-live="polite"`, the screen reader will wait until the user pauses before announcing the update. Thus, moving down in the list and selecting another planet will not announce updates in the live region. Updates in the live region will only be announced for the planet finally chosen.

Here is a screenshot of VoiceOver on Mac announcing the update (via subtitles) to the live region:

## Roles with implicit live region attributes

Elements with the following [`role="…"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles) values act as live regions by default:

<table style="width: 100%;">
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th scope="col">Role</th>
   <th scope="col">Description</th>
   <th scope="col">Compatibility Notes</th>
  </tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>log</td>
   <td>Chat, error, game or other type of log</td>
   <td>To maximize compatibility, add a redundant <code>aria-live="polite"</code> when using this role.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>status</td>
   <td>A status bar or area of the screen that provides an updated status of some kind. Screen reader users have a special command to read the current status.</td>
   <td>To maximize compatibility, add a redundant <code>aria-live="polite"</code> when using this role.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>alert</td>
   <td>Error or warning message that flashes on the screen. Alerts are particularly important for client side validation notices to users. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/example-index/alert/alert.html" class="external" rel="noopener">Alert Example.</a></td>
   <td>To maximize compatibility, some people recommend adding a redundant <code>aria-live="assertive"</code> when using this role. However, adding both <code>aria-live</code> and <code>role="alert"</code> causes double speaking issues in VoiceOver on iOS.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>progressbar</td>
   <td>A hybrid between a widget and a live region. Use this with <code>aria-valuemin</code>, <code>aria-valuenow</code> and <code>aria-valuemax</code>. (TBD: add more info here).</td>
   <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>marquee</td>
   <td>Text which scrolls, such as a stock ticker.</td>
   <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>timer</td>
   <td>Any kind of timer or clock, such as a countdown timer or stopwatch readout.</td>
   <td></td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

## Additional live region attributes

Live Regions are well supported. The Paciello Group, in 2014, posted [information about the state of the support of Live Regions](https://www.tpgi.com/screen-reader-support-aria-live-regions/). Paul J. Adam has researched [the support of `aria-atomic` and `aria-relevant`](https://pauljadam.com/demos/aria-atomic-relevant.html) in particular.

1. **`aria-atomic`**: The `aria-atomic=BOOLEAN` is used to set whether or not the screen reader should always present the live region as a whole, even if only part of the region changes. The possible settings are: `false` or `true`. The default setting is `false`.
2. [**`aria-relevant`**](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-relevant)

   : The `aria-relevant=[LIST_OF_CHANGES]` is used to set what types of changes are relevant to a live region. The possible settings are one or more of: `additions`, `removals`, `text`, `all`. The default setting is: `additions text`.

### Basic examples: `aria-atomic`

As an illustration of `aria-atomic`, consider a site with a basic clock, showing hours and minutes. The clock is updated each minute, with the new remaining time overwriting the current content.

```html
<div id="clock" role="timer" aria-live="polite">
  <span id="clock-hours"></span>
  <span id="clock-mins"></span>
</div>
```

```js
/* basic JavaScript to update the clock */
function updateClock() {
  const now = new Date();
  document.getElementById("clock-hours").textContent = now.getHours();
  document.getElementById("clock-mins").textContent =
    `0${now.getMinutes()}`.slice(-2);
}

/* first run */
updateClock();

/* update every minute */
setInterval(updateClock, 60000);
```

The first time the function executes, the entirety of the string that is added will be announced. On subsequent calls, only the parts of the content that changed compared to the previous content will be announced. For instance, when the clock changes from "17:33" to "17:34", assistive technologies will only announce "34", which won't be very useful to users.

One way around this would be to first clear all the contents of the live region (in this case, set the `innerHTML` of both `<span id="clock-hours">` and `<span id="clock-mins">` to be empty), and then inject the new content. However, this can sometimes be unreliable, as it's dependent on the exact timing of these two updates.

`aria-atomic="true"` ensures that each time the live region is updated, the entirety of the content is announced in full (e.g., "17:34").

```html
<div id="clock" role="timer" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true">…</div>
```

Another example of `aria-atomic` - an update/notification made as a result of a user action.

```html
<div id="date-input">
  <label for="year">Year:</label>
  <input type="text" id="year" value="1990" />
</div>

<div id="date-output" aria-atomic="true" aria-live="polite">
  The set year is:
  <span id="year-output">1990</span>
</div>
```

```js
function change(event) {
  const yearOut = document.getElementById("year-output");

  switch (event.target.id) {
    case "year":
      yearOut.textContent = event.target.value;
      break;
  }
}

document.getElementById("year").addEventListener("blur", change);
```

Without `aria-atomic="true"` the screen reader announces only the changed value of year. With `aria-atomic="true"`, the screen reader announces "The set year is: _changed value_"

### Basic example: `aria-relevant`

With `aria-relevant` you can specify which types of changes/updates to a live region should be announced.

As an example, consider a chat site that wants to display a list of users currently logged in. Rather than just announcing the users that are currently logged in, we also want to trigger an announcement specifically when a user is _removed_ from the list. We can achieve this by specifying `aria-relevant="additions removals"`.

```html
<ul id="roster" aria-live="polite" aria-relevant="additions removals">
  <!-- use JavaScript to add and remove users here -->
</ul>
```

Breakdown of ARIA live properties:

- `aria-live="polite"` indicates that the screen reader should wait until the user is idle before presenting updates to the user. This is the most commonly used value, as interrupting the user with "assertive" might interrupt their flow.
- `aria-atomic` is not set (`false` by default) so that only the added or removed users should be spoken and not the entire roster each time.
- `aria-relevant="additions removals"` ensures that both users added or removed to the roster will be spoken.

# Multipart labels: Using ARIA for labels with embedded fields inside them

## Problem

You have a form where you ask your user a question, but the answer is mentioned in the question itself. A classic example we all know from our browser settings is the setting "Delete history after x days". "Delete history after" is to the left of the textbox, x is the number, for example 21, and the word "days" follows the textbox, forming a sentence that is easy to understand.

If you're using a screen reader, have you noticed that, when you go to this setting in Firefox, it tells you "Delete history after 21 days"?, followed by the announcement that you're in a textbox, and that it contains the number 21. Isn't that cool? You do not need to navigate around to find out the unit. "Days" could easily be "months" or "years", and in many ordinary dialogs, there is no way to find this out other than navigating around with screen reviewing commands.

The solution is in an ARIA attribute called `aria-labelledby`. Its parameter is a string that consists of the IDs of the HTML elements you want to concatenate into a single accessible name.

Both `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` are specified on the form element that is to be labelled, for example an `<input>` In both cases, the label for/label control bindings that may also exist are overridden by `aria-labelledby`. If on an HTML page you provide `aria-labelledby`, you should also provide a label for construct to also support older browsers that do not have ARIA support yet. With Firefox 3, your visually impaired users will automatically get better accessibility from the new attribute, but the users of older browsers are not left in the dark this way.

### Example

{{ EmbedLiveSample("Example") }}

```css hidden
body {
  margin: 1rem;
}
```

```html
<input
  aria-labelledby="labelShutdown shutdownTime shutdownUnit"
  type="checkbox" />

<span id="labelShutdown">Shut down computer after</span>

<input
  aria-labelledby="labelShutdown shutdownTime shutdownUnit"
  id="shutdownTime"
  type="text"
  value="10" />

<span id="shutdownUnit"> minutes</span>
```

## A Note for JAWS 8 users

JAWS 8.0 has its own logic to find labels, causing it to always override the accessibleName the textbox of an HTML document gets. With JAWS 8, I have not found a way to make it to accept the label from the example above. But NVDA and Window-Eyes do it just fine, and Orca on Linux also has no problems.

> [!NOTE]
> TBD: add more compatibility info

## Can this be done without ARIA?

Community member Ben Millard has pointed out in a blog post that [controls can be embedded in labels as shown in the above example using HTML 4](https://projectcerbera.com/blog/2008/03/#day24), by embedding the input into the label. Thanks for that info, Ben! It is very useful and shows that some techniques that have been available for years escape even the gurus sometimes. This technique works in Firefox; however, it doesn't currently work in many other browsers, including IE. For labels with embedded form controls, using `aria-labelledby` is still the best approach.
# ARIA Screen Reader Implementors Guide

## Live Regions

This is just a guide. Live region markup is a complex area which is somewhat open to interpretation. The following is intended to provide implementation guidance that respects screen readers developers' need to try different things. The intention is to strike a balance between providing useful guidance on how to use the markup's intended meaning while supporting live regions as an area for screen readers to innovate and compete.

### Interpreting WAI-ARIA live region markup

1. Live changes are hints: in general live region markup is provided by the author as hints, and the assistive technology may allow for global, site or even region-specific settings, as well as heuristics to help with live changes on pages that have no WAI-ARIA hints.
2. Optionally, create a second, additional queue if the user configures a second hardware channel: If there are two channels for presentation (e.g., text to speech and a Braille display), then two queues can be maintained to allow for parallel presentation. The channels could be user configured for presenting live regions based on role or politeness.
3. Busy regions: Any changes in a region marked with aria-busy="true" should not be added to the queue until that attribute is cleared.
4. Politeness (`aria-live` or from [role](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles)) takes first precedence,: items should be added to the queue based on their politeness level from the `aria-live` property or inherited from the `role` (e.g., [role="log"](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/log_role) is polite by default). Assertive items are first then politeness level. Alternatively, implementations may choose to have a policy of clearing more polite items, e.g., assertive items clear any polite items from the queue.
5. Time takes second precedence: Prioritize items with the same politeness level according to when the event occurs (earlier events come first). Present items of the same politeness level in the order of what occurred first.
6. Atomic (`aria-atomic="true"`) regions with multiple changes should not be presented twice with the same content. As a new event for an atomic region is added to the queue remove an earlier event for the same region. It is probably desirable to have at least a tiny timeout before presenting atomic region changes, in order to avoid presenting the region twice for two changes that occur quickly one after the other.
7. Include labels when presenting changes: if the change occurs in something with a semantic label of some kind, speak the label. This is particularly important for changes in data cells, where the column and row headers provide important contextual information.

### Ideas for Settings and Heuristics

1. Allow for a different voice (in text-to-speech) or other varying presentational characteristics to set live changes apart.
2. When no WAI-ARIA markup is present, automatically present some changes unless the user configures all live changes to off. For example, automatically speak changes that are caused by the user's own input, as part of the context of that input.
3. Allow global settings to turn off the presentation of live changes, present all live changes, use markup, or be "smart" (use heuristics)
# Using ARIA: Roles, states, and properties

ARIA defines semantics that can be applied to elements, with these divided into **roles** (defining a type of user interface element) and **states** and **properties** that are supported by a role. Authors must assign an ARIA role and the appropriate states and properties to an element during its life-cycle, unless the element already has appropriate ARIA semantics (via use of an appropriate HTML element). Addition of ARIA semantics only exposes extra information to a browser's accessibility API, and does not affect a page's DOM.

# ARIA

Accessible Rich Internet Applications **(<abbr>ARIA</abbr>)** is a set of [roles](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles) and [attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes) that define ways to make web content and web applications (especially those developed with JavaScript) more accessible to people with disabilities.

ARIA supplements HTML so that interactions and widgets commonly used in applications can be passed to assistive technologies when there is not otherwise a mechanism. For example, ARIA enables accessible JavaScript widgets, form hints and error messages, live content updates, and more.

## Before using ARIA

> [!WARNING]
> Many of these widgets are fully supported in modern browsers. **Developers should prefer using the correct semantic HTML element over using ARIA**, if such an element exists. For instance, native elements have built-in [keyboard accessibility](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Guides/Keyboard-navigable_JavaScript_widgets), roles and states. However, if you choose to use ARIA, you are responsible for mimicking the equivalent browser behavior in script.

[The first rule of ARIA](https://w3c.github.io/using-aria/#rule1) use is "If you can use a native HTML element or attribute with the semantics and behavior you require already built in, instead of re-purposing an element and adding an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible, then do so."

> [!NOTE]
> There is a saying "No ARIA is better than bad ARIA." In [WebAim's survey of over one million home pages](https://webaim.org/projects/million/#aria), they found that Home pages with ARIA present averaged 41% more detected errors than those without ARIA. While ARIA is designed to make web pages more accessible, if used incorrectly, it can do more harm than good.

Here's the markup for a progress bar widget:

```html
<div
  id="percent-loaded"
  role="progressbar"
  aria-valuenow="75"
  aria-valuemin="0"
  aria-valuemax="100"></div>
```

This progress bar is built using a {{HTMLElement("div")}}, which has no meaning. We include ARIA roles and properties to add meaning. In this example, the [`role="progressbar"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/progressbar_role) attribute informs the browser that this element is actually a JavaScript-powered progress bar widget. The [`aria-valuemin`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-valuemin) and [`aria-valuemax`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-valuemax) attributes specify the minimum and maximum values for the progress bar, and the [`aria-valuenow`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-valuenow) describes the current state of it and therefore must be kept updated with JavaScript.

Along with placing them directly in the markup, ARIA attributes can be added to the element and updated dynamically using JavaScript code like this:

```js
// Find the progress bar <div> in the DOM.
const progressBar = document.getElementById("percent-loaded");

// Set its ARIA roles and states,
// so that assistive technologies know what kind of widget it is.
progressBar.setAttribute("role", "progressbar");
progressBar.setAttribute("aria-valuemin", 0);
progressBar.setAttribute("aria-valuemax", 100);

// Create a function that can be called at any time to update
// the value of the progress bar.
function updateProgress(percentComplete) {
  progressBar.setAttribute("aria-valuenow", percentComplete);
}
```

All content that is available to non-assistive technology users must be made available to assistive technologies. Similarly, no features should be included targeting assistive technology users that aren't also accessible to those not using assistive technologies. The above progressbar needs to be styled to make it look like a progressbar.

It would have been much simpler to use the native {{HTMLElement('progress')}} element instead:

```html
<progress id="percent-loaded" value="75" max="100">75 %</progress>
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `min` attribute is not allowed for the {{HTMLElement('progress')}} element; its minimum value is always `0`.

> [!NOTE]
> HTML landmark elements ({{HTMLElement("main")}}, {{HTMLElement("header")}}, {{HTMLElement("nav")}}, etc.) have built-in implicit ARIA roles, so there is no need to duplicate them.

## Support

Like any other web technology, there are varying degrees of support for ARIA. Support is based on the operating system and browser being used, as well as the kind of assistive technology interfacing with it. In addition, the version of the operating system, browser, and assistive technology are contributing factors. Older software versions may not support certain ARIA roles, have only partial support, or misreport its functionality.

It is also important to acknowledge that some people who rely on assistive technology are reluctant to upgrade their software, for fear of losing the ability to interact with their computer and browser. Because of this, it is important to [use semantic HTML elements](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/HTML) whenever possible, as semantic HTML has far better support for assistive technology.

It is also important to test your authored ARIA with actual assistive technology. This is because browser emulators and simulators are not really effective for testing full support. Similarly, proxy assistive technology solutions are not sufficient to fully guarantee functionality.

## Reference

The [ARIA reference](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference) is a comprehensive list of ARIA attributes and roles that are documented on MDN.

- [ARIA roles](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles)
  - : ARIA roles can be used to describe elements that don't natively exist in HTML or those which exist but don't yet have wide browser support.
- [ARIA states and properties (attributes)](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes)
  - : ARIA attributes enable modifying an element's states and properties as defined in the accessibility tree.

## Guides

The [ARIA guides](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Guides) are resources that help you improve the accessibility of web page features such as tables, forms, and keyboard-navigation.

# ARIA: aria-activedescendant attribute

The `aria-activedescendant` attribute identifies the currently active element when focus is on a [`composite`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/composite_role) widget, [`combobox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/combobox_role), [`textbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/textbox_role), [`group`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/group_role), or [`application`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/application_role).

## Description

The `aria-activedescendant` property provides a method of managing focus for assistive technologies on interactive elements when they contain multiple focusable descendants, such as menus, grids, and toolbars. Instead of the screen reader moving focus between owned elements, `aria-activedescendant` can be used on container elements to refer to the currently active element, informing assistive technology users of the currently active element when focused.

With `aria-activedescendant`, the browser keeps the DOM focus on the container element or on an input element that controls the container element. However, the user agent communicates desktop focus events and states to the assistive technology as if the element referenced by `aria-activedescendant` has focus.

This attribute is only relevant on elements with role of [`composite`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/composite_role) widget, [`combobox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/combobox_role), [`textbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/textbox_role), [`group`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/group_role), or [`application`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/application_role) whose `id` is referenced as the attribute value.

The attribute manages providing assistive technologies with information as to which element has focus, but doesn't actually create focus. Changing focus and managing the attributes value is done with JavaScript. In addition to managing that attribute value, make sure the currently active descendant is visible and in view (or scrolls into view) when focused.

In setting the value of `aria-activedescendant` on an element with DOM focus, ensure the value refers to an owned element—either a descendant of the element with DOM focus OR a logical descendant as indicated by the [`aria-owns`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-owns) attribute.

When the element with DOM focus is a combobox, textbox, or searchbox, include [`aria-controls`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-controls) to refer to the element that supports `aria-activedescendant`.

The value of `aria-activedescendant` refers to an owned element of the controlled element. For example, in a combobox, focus may remain on the combobox while the value of `aria-activedescendant` on the combobox element refers to a descendant of a popup listbox that is controlled by the combobox.

> [!NOTE]
> The attribute is supported only on a few roles. For example, `dialog`s do not support `aria-activedescendant`. When a combobox opens a dialog, DOM focus moves into the dialog from the combobox as it is not referenceable with this attribute.

> [!NOTE]
> When a descendant of a `listbox`, `grid`, or `tree` popup is focused, DOM focus remains on the combobox and the combobox has `aria-activedescendant` set to a value that refers to the focused element within the popup.

## Values

- ID reference
  - : takes as its value the `id` of the currently focused element.

## Associated interfaces

- {{domxref("Element.ariaActiveDescendantElement")}}
  - : The `ariaActiveDescendantElement` property is part of each element's interface.
    Its value is an instance of a subclass of {{domxref("Element")}} that reflects the `id` reference in the `aria-activedescendant` attribute ([with some caveats](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Reflected_attributes#reflected_element_references)).
- {{domxref("ElementInternals.ariaActiveDescendantElement")}}
  - : The `ariaActiveDescendantElement` property is part of each custom element's interface.
    Its value is an instance of a subclass of {{domxref("Element")}} that reflects the `id` reference in the `aria-activedescendant` attribute ([with some caveats](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Reflected_attributes#reflected_element_references)).

## Associated roles

Relevant only as an attribute on elements with the following roles:

- [`application`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/application_role)
- [`combobox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/combobox_role)
- [`composite`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/composite_role)

# ARIA: aria-atomic attribute

In ARIA live regions, the global `aria-atomic` attribute indicates whether assistive technologies such as a screen reader will present all, or only parts of, the changed region based on the change notifications defined by the [`aria-relevant`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-relevant) attribute.

## Description

Live regions are sections of a web page that are updated, whether by user interaction or not, when user focus is elsewhere. As they update outside the user's focus, assistive technologies such as screen readers may not "see" the update to report it to the user. WAI-ARIA has 4 properties that allow the developer to identify these live regions and tell the assistive technology how to process them, including [`aria-live`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-live), [`aria-relevant`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-relevant), [`aria-busy`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-busy) and `aria-atomic`.

When the content of a live region changes, the DOM is traversed from the changed element through its ancestors to find the first element with `aria-atomic` set. This determines the content that the user should be presented with.

If no ancestor has explicitly set `aria-atomic`, only the node or nodes of live region content that have been updated are read. The difference between omitting `aria-atomic` altogether and explicitly setting an ARIA live region's ancestor node with `aria-atomic="false"` is that explicitly setting `aria-atomic="false"` will stop the screen reader from going up the ancestor chain. Both lead to only the updated node being read. When set to `aria-atomic="true"`, the entire changed region as a whole will be presented, including the updated node's `label`, if there is one.

## Values

- `false` (default)
  - : present only the changed node or nodes.
- `true`
  - : present the entire changed region as a whole, including the author-defined label if one exists.

## Associated roles

Used in **ALL** [roles](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles).

# ARIA: aria-autocomplete attribute

The `aria-autocomplete` attribute indicates whether inputting text could trigger display of one or more predictions of the user's intended value for a [`combobox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/combobox_role), [`searchbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/searchbox_role), or [`textbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/textbox_role) and specifies how predictions will be presented if they are made.

## Description

Autocompletion is user interface feature wherein inline suggestions are made as a user types in an input. Suggested text for completing the value of the field dynamically appears in the field after the input cursor, and the suggested value becomes the value if the user performs an action, such as tabbing, that causes focus to leave the field.

The `aria-autocomplete` property describes the type of autocompletion interaction model a textbox, searchbox, or combobox will use when dynamically helping users complete text input. It distinguishes between two models: the **inline** model (`aria-autocomplete="inline"`), which presents a single predicted value and the **list** model (`aria-autocomplete="list"`), which presents a collection of possible values in a separate element that pops up next to or below the text input, similar to a {{HTMLElement('datalist')}}. A third value, `aria-autocomplete="both"` is for when the interface will present a list while also including a predicted value. The default is `none`, meaning the textbox, searchbox, or combobox will not provide an auto complete value.

The `aria-autocomplete` property only describes the type of predictive behavior for an input element for assistive technologies; it doesn't provide the functionality. The actual autocompletion should be provided using HTML attributes or JavaScript.

If the suggested autocomplete value provides suggested values that aren't dependent on the input provided by the user, consider omitting autocomplete for everyone. For example, a searchbox input displaying unfiltered recent search terms may be helpful to a marketing team on an e-commerce site, but likely isn't helpful for the screen reader user. When it is best to not specify a value for `aria-autocomplete` or to set the value to the `none` default, likely your non-assistive technology users also don't need the experience.

When implementing autocomplete functionality, ensure the suggested portion of the value is presented as selected text to enable distinguishing between a user's input and the suggestion. Make sure that when the suggested value is not the desired value, users can easily delete the suggestion or replace it by continuing to type.

When implementing a list of values, DOM focus should remain on the text input while the suggestion list is displayed.

- include [`aria-controls`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-controls) with the value of the id of the suggested list of values.
- include [`aria-haspopup`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-haspopup) matching the role of the element that contains the collection of suggested values.
- manage focus, if required, including using [`aria-activedescendant`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-activedescendant) if the collection container supports.
- use the [`aria-expanded`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-expanded) state on the element with role [`combobox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/combobox_role) to communicate that the list is displayed.

If an autocomplete list value is automatically accepted when the field loses focus, the list must be contained in a role that supports `aria-activedescendant`, with the value of `aria-activedescendant` on the input field dynamically adjusted to refer to the element containing the selected suggestion.

## Values

- `none` (default)
  - : When a user is providing input, no automatic suggestion is displayed.
- `inline`
  - : `aria-autocomplete="inline"` text suggesting one way to complete the provided input may be dynamically inserted after the caret.
- `list`
  - : `aria-autocomplete="list"` When a user is providing input, an element containing a collection of values that could complete the provided input may be displayed.
- `both`
  - : `aria-autocomplete="both"` an input to offer both models at the same time. When a user is providing input, an element containing a collection of values that could complete the provided input may be displayed. If displayed, one value in the collection is automatically selected, and the text needed to complete the automatically selected value appears after the caret in the input.

## Associated roles

Used in roles:

- [`combobox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/combobox_role) role
- [`textbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/textbox_role) role

# ARIA: aria-braillelabel attribute

The global `aria-braillelabel` property defines a string value that labels the current element, which is intended to be converted into Braille.

## Description

The global `aria-braillelabel` attribute is similar to the global [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) in that it defines a string value that labels the current element. While `aria-label` is read by the screen reader, the contents of the `aria-braillelabel` attribute are converted into Braille; providing the user with a recognizable name of the object in braille.

The purpose of the `aria-braillelabel` property is to override how assistive technologies localize and express the accessible name of an element in Braille. It should only be used when, without this attribute, the accessible name would not be the desired user experience when converted to braille.

When using `aria-braillelabel`, ensure that:

- The element to which `aria-braillelabel` is applied has a valid accessible name.
- The value of `aria-braillelabel` has actual content and is not empty or only whitespace in unicode or unicode braille.
- The value is NOT the same as the accessible name.
- The `aria-braillelabel` values are localized to align with the document language.
- Communicate to the user that this attribute is available, especially if the content contains unicode braille patterns, so the user knows to set the settings to apply user specific braille translations

> [!NOTE]
> Assistive technologies with braille support can convert the accessible names to braille.
> Therefore, only use `aria-braillelabel` when the accessible name is not the user experience you want.

Using only the accessible name, e.g., from content or via `aria-label` is almost always the better user experience, so don't use aria-braillelabel to replicate aria-label. Only use `aria-braillelabel` if the accessible name cannot provide an adequate braille representation.

```html
<button aria-braillelabel="***">
  <img alt="3 out of 5 stars" src="three_stars.png" />
</button>
```

A braille display may display "btn \*\*\*" in Braille rather than the more verbose "btn gra 3 out of 5 stars".

## Values

- `<string>`
  - : The value is a string, an unconstrained value type, that is intended to be converted into braille.

## Associated roles

Used in **ALL** roles.

# ARIA: aria-brailleroledescription attribute

The global `aria-brailleroledescription` attribute defines a human-readable, author-localized abbreviated description for the role of an element intended to be converted into Braille.

## Description

Braille is not a one-to-one transliteration of letters and numbers, but rather it includes various abbreviations, contractions, and characters that represent words (known as logograms).

Instead of converting long role descriptions to Braille, the `aria-brailleroledescription` attribute allows for providing an abbreviated version of the [`aria-roledescription`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-roledescription) value, which is a human-readable, author-localized description for the role of an element, for improved user experience with braille interfaces.

Basically, the value of `aria-brailleroledescription` is an abbreviated version of the `aria-roledescription` attribute to be converted into Braille.

```html
<article
  aria-roledescription="slide"
  aria-brailleroledescription="sld"
  aria-labelledby="slide1heading">
  <h1 id="slide1heading">Welcome to my talk</h1>
  <img alt="Me" src="images/me.jpg" />
</article>
```

Most assistive technologies, like screen readers, will read the above as "slide, welcome to my talk. Image, Me." Braille assistive technologies will present "sld welcome to my talk gra me" in braille. The semantic {{HTMLElement('article')}} is given the role of "slide" by the `aria-roledescription` attribute; "slide" being a role not defined in the specification, but is a common role for slides in a presentation. In Braille, the role is presented as "sld". The "gra" is short for "graphic", which is how the "image" role is shortened in braille.

The `aria-brailleroledescription` attribute should only be used to clarify the purpose of non-interactive container roles like "group" or "region", or to provide a more specific description of a widget in a braille context.

As the `aria-brailleroledescription` attribute overrides how assistive technologies localize and express the name of a role in braille, inappropriate values will prevent users from understanding and interacting with an element on braille interfaces.

Only use `aria-brailleroledescription` if [`aria-roledescription`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-roledescription) is present. However, if the `aria-roledescription` value works in braille, the braille version of the attribute is not needed. In general, `aria-brailleroledescription` should only be used in the rare case when a `aria-roledescription` is too verbose for braille.

A few rules to remember:

- Only apply `aria-brailleroledescription` to elements with a valid ARIA role or elements with implicit role semantics.
- The `aria-brailleroledescription`, if present, must have a non-empty, none null value that is different from the `aria-roledescription` value, which, in turn, is different from the ARIA explicit or role or implicit semantic role.
- Avoid using Unicode Braille Patterns. If they must be used, ensure the `aria-brailleroledescription` value contains content other than unicode braille patterns, whitespace, and braille pattern dots-0.
- Ensure the value is always localized to the document's language.

> [!WARNING]
> If the content is only in unicode braille patterns, the value will not be translated according to the user's preferred translation table.

> [!NOTE]
> Do NOT use `aria-brailleroledescription` to replicate `aria-roledescription`. Only include this attribute when `aria-roledescription` does not provide an adequate braille representation.

The `aria-brailleroledescription` value will not be exposed to the braille user if:

- The value is empty or contains only whitespace characters or the empty braille pattern: dots-0 (U+2800).
- The element to which the attribute is applied has an explicit or implicit WAI-ARIA role where `aria-brailleroledescription` is prohibited, including the `generic` role.
- The element to which the attribute is applied does not have a valid `aria-roledescription`.

> [!NOTE]
> Test your sites and applications with daily users of assistive technologies, including braille readers, to ensure your content makes sense in braille.

## Values

- `<string>`
  - : The value is a string, an unconstrained value type, that is intended to be converted into braille

## Associated roles

Used in **ALL** roles (except [`generic`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/generic_role)).

# ARIA: aria-busy attribute

The `aria-busy` attribute is a global ARIA state that indicates whether an element is currently being modified.
It helps assistive technologies understand that changes to the content are not yet complete, and that they may want to wait before informing users of the update.
While `aria-busy` is commonly used in [ARIA live regions](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Guides/Live_regions) to delay announcements until updates are complete, it can also be used outside of live regions—for example, in widgets or feeds—to signal ongoing changes or loading.

When multiple parts of a live region need to be loaded before changes are announced to the user, set `aria-busy="true"` until loading is complete. Then set to `aria-busy="false"`. This prevents assistive technologies from announcing changes before updates are done.

## Description

There is a section of content that updates. The updates are important and you want to let the user know when it has been modified, so you have converted it into an [ARIA live region](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Guides/Live_regions) with the [`aria-live`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-live) attribute. You may want to update several components of that section at the same time, but you can't be sure that everything will update simultaneously. Even if it is a very important live region with `aria-live="assertive"`, you don't want to interrupt the user multiple times as different parts of the content load. This is where `aria-busy` can help.

The `aria-busy` property is an optional property of live regions that can have the value `true` or `false`. The `aria-busy` attribute with a value of `true` can be added to an element currently being updated or modified, to inform the assistive technology that it should wait until the modifications or changes are complete before exposing the content to the user. Use the [`ariaBusy`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/ariaBusy) property of the object to change the value to `false` when downloading is complete.

```js
ariaLiveElement.ariaBusy = "false";
```

[`aria-live`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-live)'s value dictates whether the changes are announced immediately upon changing the value to `false`, or the assistive technology waits until the current task is complete before interrupting the user.

### Within a `feed`

If an element with [`feed`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/feed_role) role has `aria-busy` set to `true`, the rendering changes that occur inside the feed will not be announced with the exception of user-initiated changes.

### Within a `widget`

If changes to a rendered widget would create a state where the widget is missing required owned elements during script execution, set `aria-busy` to `true` on the widget during the update process. For example, if a rendered tree grid updates multiple branches not necessarily rendered simultaneously, an alternative to replacing the whole tree in a single update would be to mark the tree busy while each of the branches is modified.

## Values

- false (default):
  - : There are no expected updates for the element.
- true
  - : The element is being updated.

## Associated interfaces

- {{domxref("Element.ariaBusy")}}
  - : The [`ariaBusy`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/ariaBusy) property, part of each element's interface, reflects the value of the `aria-busy` attribute, which indicates whether an element is being modified.

# ARIA: aria-checked attribute

The `aria-checked` attribute indicates the current "checked" state of checkboxes, radio buttons, and other widgets.

> [!NOTE]
> Where possible use an HTML {{htmlelement("input")}} element with `type="checkbox"` and `type="radio"` as these have built in semantics and do not require ARIA attributes.

## Description

The `aria-checked` attribute indicates whether the element is checked (`true`), unchecked (`false)`, or if the checked status is indeterminate (`mixed`), meaning it is neither checked nor unchecked. The `mixed` value is supported by the tri-state input roles of [`checkbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/checkbox_role) and [`menuitemcheckbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitemcheckbox_role).

The `mixed` value is not supported on [`radio`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/radio_role), [`menuitemradio`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitemradio_role), or [`switch`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/switch_role) and elements that inherits from these. The value will be false if `mixed` is set when not supported.

```html
<span
  role="checkbox"
  id="checkBoxInput"
  aria-checked="false"
  tabindex="0"
  aria-labelledby="chk15-label"></span>
<label id="chk15-label">Subscribe to the newsletter</label>
```

The `tabindex` attribute is required to enable focus. JavaScript is required to toggle the `aria-checked` state. And, if this checkbox is part of a submittable form, more JavaScript is required to set a name and a value.

The above could have been written as:

```html
<input type="checkbox" id="chk15-label" name="Subscribe" />
<label for="chk15-label">Subscribe to the newsletter</label>
```

By using the {{htmlelement("input")}} element with `type="checkbox"` instead of ARIA, there is no need for any JavaScript.

## Values

- false
  - : The element supports being checked but is not currently checked.
- true
  - : The element is checked.
- mixed
  - : for [`checkbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/checkbox_role) and [`menuitemcheckbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitemcheckbox_role) only, equivalent to `indeterminate`, indicating a mixed mode value of neither checked nor unchecked.
- undefined (default)
  - : The element does not support being checked.

## Associated roles

# ARIA: aria-colcount attribute

The `aria-colcount` attribute defines the total number of columns in a [`table`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/table_role), [`grid`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/grid_role), or [`treegrid`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/treegrid_role) when not all columns are present in the [DOM](/en-US/docs/Glossary/DOM).

## Description

Some tables are very large, and it's not possible to show all the columns to the user. Or, it is possible, but having such a wide table would be a bad user experience. Use the `aria-colcount` attribute to let assistive technologies know how many columns the table would have if all columns were present. The value is an integer representing the number of columns that make up the full table. If you don't know the total number of columns a table will have, but know they will not all be in the DOM, use the value -1, so `aria-colcount="-1"`. This value tells the user agent that the current number of columns present in the DOM may not be the actual number of columns in the table.

If all columns in a table are present in the DOM, the `aria-colcount` attribute isn't needed, as browsers automatically calculate the total number of columns. However, if only a portion of the columns is present in the DOM at a given moment, that is when this attribute is helpful and needed.

When using `aria-colcount` when you have a known number of columns, make sure to also use [`aria-colindex`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-colindex) to label each column, or, if the columns are contiguous－if it's a group of columns in the original order with no breaks－label each row.

The following example shows a grid with 6 columns, of which columns 1, 2, 5, and 6 are displayed to the user. The total number of columns that make up the table is set as `aria-colcount="6"` on the table itself. As the columns aren't contiguous, every [`cell`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/cell_role) - in this case [`columnheader`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/columnheader_role) and [`gridcell`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/gridcell_role) elements - have the `aria-colindex` attribute set.

```html
<div role="grid" aria-colcount="6">
  <div role="rowgroup">
    <div role="row">
      <div role="columnheader" aria-colindex="1">First name</div>
      <div role="columnheader" aria-colindex="2">Last name</div>
      <div role="columnheader" aria-colindex="5">City</div>
      <div role="columnheader" aria-colindex="6">Zip</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div role="rowgroup">
    <div role="row">
      <div role="gridcell" aria-colindex="1">Debra</div>
      <div role="gridcell" aria-colindex="2">Burks</div>
      <div role="gridcell" aria-colindex="5">New York</div>
      <div role="gridcell" aria-colindex="6">14127</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  …
</div>
```

The first rule of ARIA use is "if you can use a native feature with the semantics and behavior you require already built in, instead of repurposing an element and **adding** an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible, then do so." If we employ native HTML semantics with {{HTMLElement('table')}}, {{HTMLElement('th')}}, {{HTMLElement('td')}}, etc., the `aria-colcount` attribute is still necessary, but the mark up is not as verbose. When using semantic table header elements and not all columns are in the DOM, the `aria-colcount` must still be used, but the `aria-colindex` attribute only needs to be defined once per column in the column header {{HTMLElement('th')}}.

```html
<table aria-colcount="6">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th aria-colindex="1" scope="col">First name</th>
      <th aria-colindex="2" scope="col">Last name</th>
      <th aria-colindex="5" scope="col">City</th>
      <th aria-colindex="6" scope="col">Zip</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Debra</td>
      <td>Burks</td>
      <td>New York</td>
      <td>14127</td>
    </tr>
    …
  </tbody>
</table>
```

# ARIA: aria-colindex attribute

The `aria-colindex` attribute defines an element's column index or position with respect to the total number of columns within a `table`, `grid`, or `treegrid`.

## Description

Some tables are very large, and as a result have only a portion of its content is initially displayed. While loading only a subsection of the columns may improve user experience, you need to let all users know what portions of the content are being displayed, and that all the table's content is not present.

ARIA provides several attributes to provide information about `table`, `grid`, and `treegrid` structures. The `aria-colindex` attribute defines the substructure, an element's column index or position with respect to the total number of columns, within such structures.

Used in conjunction with the [`aria-colcount`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-colcount) attribute, which informs assistive technologies how many columns the table would have if all columns were present, the `aria-colindex` is used an element's column index or position with respect to that total number of columns.

If all of the columns are present in the DOM, including `aria-colindex` is not necessary as user agents can calculate the column index of each cell or gridcell. However, if any of the columns are left out of the DOM at any time, use `aria-colindex` to indicate the column of each cell or gridcell with respect to the full table.

The value for `aria-colindex` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. Each value should be greater than the previous column's `aria-colindex` and less than or equal to the number of columns in the full table.

If a cell or gridcell spans multiple columns, set [`aria-colspan`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-colspan) to the number of columns it spans if not using {{htmlelement('td')}} and {{htmlelement('th')}} HTML elements, and set `aria-colindex` to the value of the start of the span; the value it would have had if it was only one column wide spanning only the first of its columns.

If the set of columns which is present in the DOM is contiguous, and if there are no cells which span more than one row or column in that set, you only have to put the `aria-colindex` once on each row on the first column of the set. If the columns are not contiguous, include the `aria-colindex` value on all of the children or owned elements of each row.

The following example shows a grid with 6 columns, of which columns 1, 2, 5, and 6 are displayed to the user. The total number of columns that make up the table is set as `aria-colcount="6"` on the table itself. As the columns aren't contiguous, every [`cell`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/cell_role) - in this case [`columnheader`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/columnheader_role) and [`gridcell`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/gridcell_role) elements - have the `aria-colindex` attribute set.

```html
<div role="grid" aria-colcount="6">
  <div role="rowgroup">
    <div role="row">
      <div role="columnheader" aria-colindex="1">First name</div>
      <div role="columnheader" aria-colindex="2">Last name</div>
      <div role="columnheader" aria-colindex="5">City</div>
      <div role="columnheader" aria-colindex="6">Zip</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div role="rowgroup">
    <div role="row">
      <div role="gridcell" aria-colindex="1">Debra</div>
      <div role="gridcell" aria-colindex="2">Burks</div>
      <div role="gridcell" aria-colindex="5">New York</div>
      <div role="gridcell" aria-colindex="6">14127</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  …
</div>
```

The first rule of ARIA use is "if you can use a native feature with the semantics and behavior you require already built in, instead of repurposing an element and **adding** an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible, then do so." If we employ native HTML semantics with {{HTMLElement('table')}}, {{HTMLElement('th')}}, {{HTMLElement('td')}}, etc., and only display a subsection of columns, the `aria-colcount` and `aria-colindex` attribute are still necessary, but the mark up is not as verbose.

When using semantic table header elements and not all columns are in the DOM, the `aria-colindex` attribute only needs to be defined once per column in the column header {{HTMLElement('th')}}.

```html
<table aria-colcount="6">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th aria-colindex="1" scope="col">First name</th>
      <th aria-colindex="2" scope="col">Last name</th>
      <th aria-colindex="5" scope="col">City</th>
      <th aria-colindex="6" scope="col">Zip</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Debra</td>
      <td>Burks</td>
      <td>New York</td>
      <td>14127</td>
    </tr>
    …
  </tbody>
</table>
```

If all the columns are in the DOM, neither `aria-colcount` nor `aria-colindex` are necessary.

# ARIA: aria-colindextext attribute

The `aria-colindextext` attribute defines a human-readable text alternative of the numeric [`aria-colindex`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-colindex).

## Description

When you have a very large table or when you purposefully want to display just a section of a table, not all columns may be present in the DOM. When this happens, we use the [`aria-colcount`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-colcount) with an integer value to define how many columns the table (or grid) would have if all the columns were present and add the [`aria-colindex`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-colindex) property on each column to provide information on the column index within that larger table.

In the following HTML snippet, our table has 8 columns, but we are only displaying 4. The "city" column is the fifth column of our larger table, as defined by `aria-colindex="5"`.

```html
<table aria-colcount="8">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th aria-colindex="1" scope="col">First name</th>
      <th aria-colindex="2" scope="col">Last name</th>
      <th aria-colindex="5" scope="col">City</th>
      <th aria-colindex="7" scope="col">Zip</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  …
</table>
```

This table is not very complex. Had this been a 100+ column spreadsheet or a grid without column headers, such as a chess board, the provided or calculated value of `aria-colindex` might not be meaningful or may not reflect the displayed index. When this is the case, `aria-colindextext` can be included. The value is a string that is a human-readable text alternative to the numeric `aria-colindex`.

```html
<table aria-colcount="128">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th aria-colindex="1" aria-colindextext="NYSE stock symbol" scope="col">
        NYSE
      </th>
      <th
        aria-colindex="110"
        aria-colindextext="Value at start of 2021"
        scope="col">
        01/21
      </th>
      <th
        aria-colindex="122"
        aria-colindextext="Value at start of 2022"
        scope="col">
        01/22
      </th>
      <th aria-colindex="124" scope="col">Recommendation</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  …
</table>
```

In the above example, the table has 128 columns of which only 4 columns are shown. The `aria-colindextext` is used in three columns to provide human-readable text alternatives. By including `aria-colindextext="Value at start of 2021"`, assistive technologies can announce "Value at start of 2021" instead of "Column 110".

Only use `aria-colindextext` when the provided or calculated value of `aria-colindex` is not meaningful or does not reflect the displayed index. Whenever you include `aria-colindextext`, also keep the `aria-colindex` as some assistive technologies rely on the numeric column index for the purpose of keeping track of the user's position and in providing alternative table navigation.

> [!NOTE]
> While `aria-colindex` can be added to a row when all the columns present are contiguous as sequential values can be deduced, `aria-colindextext` is NOT a supported property of [`row`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/row_role).

See related [`aria-rowindextext`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-rowindextext).

# ARIA: aria-colspan attribute

The `aria-colspan` attribute defines the number of columns spanned by a cell or gridcell within a [`table`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/table_role), [`grid`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/grid_role), or [`treegrid`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/treegrid_role).

## Description

Intended for [`cell`s](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/cell_role) and [`gridcell`s](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/gridcell_role) which are not contained in a native HTML {{HTMLElement('table')}}, the `aria-colspan` property value defines the number of columns spanned by an individual cell an ARIA [`table`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/table_role), [`grid`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/grid_role), or [`treegrid`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/treegrid_role).

In HTML, {{HTMLElement('th')}} and {{HTMLElement('td')}} elements have the [`colspan`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/td#attributes) attribute. When using the semantic {{HTMLElement('table')}}, use the native `colspan` attribute as designed. This ARIA attribute is intended for cells and gridcells which are not contained in a native table, and will be ignored if used on a cell in a {{HTMLElement('table')}}.

> [!NOTE]
> The first rule of ARIA use is if you can use a native feature with the semantics and behavior you require already built in, instead of repurposing an element and **adding** an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible, then do so. Employ HTML {{HTMLelement('table')}} elements, including {{HTMLelement('td')}} and {{HTMLelement('th')}} with the `colspan` attribute instead of non-semantic elements with ARIA roles and attributes whenever possible.

The value of `aria-colspan` should be a positive integer. The default or assumed value of a cell span is 1. Make sure that the included value does cause the cell or gridcell to overlap the next cell or gridcell in the same row and does not cause the cell to span outside of the containing table, grid, or treegrid.

## Example

The following is an example of part of a bowling tournament league scoring spreadsheet. Each game spans 10 frames, and each frame spans a 3 scores: two balls and the current total. The 10th (and last) frame in each game spans 4 columns in case someone is scoring all strikes.

```html
<div role="grid" aria-rowcount="27">
  aria-label="Bowling League Scores"
  <div role="rowgroup">
    <div role="row" aria-rowindex="1">

            aria-rowspan and aria-colspan provide
            assistive technologies with the correct data cell header information

          -->

# ARIA: aria-controls attribute

The global `aria-controls` property identifies the element (or elements) whose contents or presence are controlled by the element on which this attribute is set.

## Description

When an interactive widget or element, be it a combobox, tab, button, etc., is used to adjust or modify another element or component in a document or application, the `aria-controls` attribute can be used to programmatically associate the corresponding element or elements with the controlling element. The `aria-controls` attribute identifies the element (or elements) whose contents or presence are controlled by the element on which the attribute is set, regardless of what type of interaction initiates the impacted behavior.

A [combobox](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/combobox_role) element has `aria-controls` set to a value that refers to the element that serves as the popup. The `aria-controls` only needs to be set when the popup is visible, but it is valid and easier to program to reference an element that is not visible.

Other examples of controls include:

- The button parts of an accordion widget that toggle the visibility of their associated panel content. Each button may have an `aria-controls` specified, referencing the ID of the element containing the content associated with the invoking control.
- An element with a role of [`scrollbar`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/scrollbar_role): the scrollbar requires an `aria-controls` attribute referencing the ID of the element it controls.
- A group of tabs that each display a different tab panel: each element with [`role="tab"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tab_role) has an `aria-controls` attribute referencing its associated [`tabpanel`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tabpanel_role).

## Example

In this tabs example, each tab controls one tabpanel:

```html
<div class="tab-interface">
  <div role="tablist" aria-label="Sample Tabs">
    <span
      role="tab"
      aria-selected="true"
      aria-controls="panel-1"
      id="tab-1"
      tabindex="0">
      First Tab
    </span>
    <span
      role="tab"
      aria-selected="false"
      aria-controls="panel-2"
      id="tab-2"
      tabindex="-1">
      Second Tab
    </span>
    <span
      role="tab"
      aria-selected="false"
      aria-controls="panel-3"
      id="tab-3"
      tabindex="-1">
      Third Tab
    </span>
  </div>
  <div id="panel-1" role="tabpanel" tabindex="0" aria-labelledby="tab-1">
    <p>Content for the first panel</p>
  </div>
  <div
    id="panel-2"
    role="tabpanel"
    tabindex="0"
    aria-labelledby="tab-2"
    class="display-none">
    <p>Content for the second panel</p>
  </div>
  <div
    id="panel-3"
    role="tabpanel"
    tabindex="0"
    aria-labelledby="tab-3"
    class="display-none">
    <p>Content for the third panel</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

> [!NOTE]
> ARIA only modifies the accessibility tree for an element, identifying how assistive technology can present the content to users. ARIA doesn't change any implicit functionality or styling.

# ARIA: aria-current attribute

A non-null `aria-current` state on an element indicates that this element represents the current item within a container or set of related elements.

## Description

When you have a group of related elements, such as several links in a breadcrumb or steps in a multi-step flow, with one element in the group styled differently from the others to indicate to the sighted user that this is the current element within its group, the `aria-current` should be used to inform the assistive technology user what has been indicated via styling.

In a breadcrumb list, when a link within a set of pagination links is styled to indicate the user is currently on that page, `aria-current="page"` should be set on that link. In a multi step based process with a step indicator such as a multi-page survey or a multi step checkout or registration process, when the current step icon is visually different to represent that it is the current step, that icon's container should have `aria-current="step"` for assistive technology users who may not be able to "see" the visual difference.

The `aria-current` attribute indicates the element on which it is set, to a value other than `false`, represents the current item within a container or set of related elements. Only mark one element in a set of elements as current with `aria-current`.

The `aria-current` attribute accepts a limited list of [values](#values) including `page`, `step`, `location`, `date`, `time`, `true`, and `false`. Any non-null string value not included in this list of enumerated values is treated as if `aria-current="true"` were set, not the default `false` value. If the attribute is not present, is an empty string, is present with no value, or is set to `aria-current="false"` it is not exposed to the user.

When something is selected rather than current, such as a [`tab`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tab_role) in a [`tablist`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tablist_role), use [`aria-selected`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-selected) to indicate the currently-displayed tabpanel.

> [!NOTE]
> Don't use `aria-current` as a substitute for [`aria-selected`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-selected) in [`gridcell`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/gridcell_role), [`option`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/option_role), [`row`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/row_role) or [`tab`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tab_role).

## Example

The breadcrumb for the "current page" should have `aria-current="page"` set on it.

```html
<nav aria-label="Breadcrumb" class="breadcrumb">
  <ol>
    <li>
      <a href="../../../../../">Web technology for developers</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="../../../../">Accessibility</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="../../../">ARIA</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="../../">ARIA States and Properties</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="./" aria-current="page">ARIA: `aria-current` attribute</a>
    </li>
  </ol>
</nav>
```

If the element representing the current page in the breadcrumb was not a link, the `aria-current` is optional.

## Values

- `page`
  - : Represents the current page within a set of pages such as the link to the current document in a breadcrumb.
- `step`
  - : Represents the current step within a process such as the current step in an enumerated multi step checkout flow.
- `location`
  - : Represents the current location within an environment or context such as the image that is visually highlighted as the current component of a flow chart.
- `date`
  - : Represents the current date within a collection of dates such as the current date within a calendar.
- `time`
  - : Represents the current time within a set of times such as the current time within a timetable.
- `true`
  - : Represents the current item within a set.
- `false` (default)
  - : Does not represent the current item within a set.

## Associated interfaces

- {{domxref("Element.ariaCurrent")}}
  - : The [`ariaCurrent`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/ariaCurrent) property, part of the {{domxref("Element")}} interface, reflects the value of the `aria-current` attribute.

# ARIA: aria-describedby attribute

The global `aria-describedby` attribute identifies the element (or elements) that describes the element on which the attribute is set.

## Description

The `aria-describedby` attribute lists the [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/id)s of the elements that describe the object. It is used to establish a relationship between widgets or groups and the text that describes them.

The `aria-describedby` attribute is not limited to form controls. It can also be used to associate static text with widgets, groups of elements, regions that have a heading, definitions, and more. The `aria-describedby` attribute can be used with semantic HTML elements and with elements that have an ARIA [`role`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles).

The `aria-describedby` attribute is very similar to the [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) attribute. While `aria-labelledby` lists the `id`s of the labels or elements that describe the essence of an object, `aria-describedby` lists the `id`s of the descriptions or elements providing more information that the user might need. Both `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` reference other elements to calculate a text alternative, but a label should be concise, while a description is intended to provide more verbose information; a label describes the essence of an object, while a description provides more information that the user might need.

The elements linked via `aria-describedby` don't need to be visible. It is possible to reference an element even if that element is hidden. For example, a form control can have a description that is hidden by default and revealed on request using a disclosure widget like a "more information" icon. The sighted users click on the icon to view the description, while assistive technology users can immediately access it as the description is referenced from that form control with `aria-describedby`.

The `aria-describedby` property is appropriate when the associated content contains plain text. If the content is extensive, contains useful semantics, or has a complex structure requiring user navigation, use [`aria-details`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-details) instead. `aria-details` allows assistive technology users to visit the associated structured content and provides additional navigation commands, making it easier to understand the structure, or to experience the information in smaller pieces.

> [!NOTE]
> The `aria-describedby` content should only be a text string. If there are important underlying semantics in the content, consider using [`aria-details`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-details).

## Example

```html
<button aria-describedby="trash-desc">Move to trash</button>
…
<p id="trash-desc">
  Items in the trash will be permanently removed after 30 days.
</p>
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `aria-describedby` attribute is not designed to reference descriptions from external resources. As its value is one or more `id`s (space-separated if multiple), it must reference elements in the same DOM document.

## Values

- ID reference list
  - : The `id` or space-separated list of element `id`s that describe the current element.

## Associated interfaces

- {{domxref("Element.ariaDescribedByElements")}}
  - : The `ariaDescribedByElements` property is part of each element's interface.
    Its value is an array of subclasses of {{domxref("Element")}} that reflect the `id` references in the `aria-describedby` attribute ([with some caveats](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Reflected_attributes#reflected_element_references)).
- {{domxref("ElementInternals.ariaDescribedByElements")}}
  - : The `ariaDescribedByElements` property is part of each custom element's interface.
    Its value is an array of subclasses of {{domxref("Element")}} that reflect the `id` references in the `aria-describedby` attribute ([with some caveats](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Reflected_attributes#reflected_element_references)).

# ARIA: aria-description attribute

The global `aria-description` attribute defines a string value that describes or annotates the current element.

> [!NOTE]
> `aria-description` is still in W3C Editor's Draft for ARIA 1.3. For the time being, continue to use [`aria-describedby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-describedby), which has been supported since ARIA 1.1.

## Description

The global `aria-description` attribute provides a mechanism for the developer to describe or annotate the current element providing greater context for assistive technology users.

```html
<div
  role="application"
  aria-label="calendar"
  aria-description="Game schedule for the Boston Red Sox 2021 Season">
  <h1>Red Sox 2021</h1>
  <div role="grid">…</div>
</div>
```

The `aria-description` attribute is similar to [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) in that both provide a text string to associate with the element, but a label should be short and concise, while the description can be longer as it is intended to provide more context and information.

The `aria-description` and `aria-describedby` properties have the same purpose; both provide the user with additional descriptive text for the object on which it is set. If descriptive text is available in the DOM, use [`aria-describedby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-describedby) instead.

The `aria-description` property should only be used when providing a visible description is not the desired user experience. The `aria-describedby` attribute takes as its value a list of `id`s of the elements that contain descriptive text about the object. The `aria-description` is used when there is no appropriate descriptive text that can be associated with the object by `id` reference. If both attributes are present, `aria-describedby` takes precedence in defining the {{glossary("accessible description")}} property.

The content of the description, whether set by `aria-description` or `aria-describedby`, should be flat text. If the content is very long, has semantic meaning requirements, or has a navigational structure, use [`aria-details`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-details) instead.

## Values

- `<string>`
  - : The value is a string, an unconstrained value type, that is intended to be conveyed to the assistive technology user.

## Associated interfaces

- {{domxref("Element.ariaDescription")}}
  - : The [`ariaDescription`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/ariaDescription) property, part of the {{domxref("Element")}} interface, reflects the value of the `aria-description` attribute, which defines a string value that describes or annotates the current element.

# ARIA: aria-details attribute

The global `aria-details` attribute identifies the element (or elements) that provide additional information related to the object.

## Description

The `aria-details` attribute can be used to provide additional information or complex descriptions to an object. It is used to inform assistive technology users about the content by providing more in-depth information, whether that content is within the current document or a link to additional assets.

There are other HTML and WAI-ARIA properties that have similar purposes. The HTML {{HTMLElement('label')}} element and the [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) and [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) properties are used to provide short labels for an object. The HTML `title` attribute and the [`aria-description`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-description) and [`aria-describedby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-describedby) properties provide for longer plain text descriptions of an object. However, when additional information, complex descriptions, or navigable content related to the object is necessary and available, the `aria-details` attribute should be used.

The `aria-details` attribute serves a similar purpose as HTML's never fully-supported `longdesc` attribute － a URL of a long description to a replaced element's content － which was deprecated due to lack of support and misuse.

The `aria-details` attribute takes the [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/id), or space separated list of `id`s of the elements to get more detailed information as its values. When `aria-details` is included on an element, assistive technologies inform users of the availability of extended information, enabling the user to navigate to the referenced content.

Elements referenced by `aria-details` are intended to contain more information than would normally be provided via [`aria-describedby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-describedby).

The elements referenced by `aria-details` should be visible to all users. `aria-details` informs users that otherwise might not be able to scan a screen and discern quickly that the explanatory content is available.

> [!NOTE]
> `aria-details` has no impact on the accessible description.

Unlike `aria-describedby`, elements referenced by `aria-details` are not used in accessible descriptions and are not turned into a plain string when presented to assistive technology users. If the associated content is not too long and flattening the contents of the referenced element to a simple string of text wouldn't cause loss of information, consider using `aria-describedby` instead. That said, it is valid for an element to have both `aria-details` and a description specified with either `aria-describedby` or `aria-description`.

## Example

When it comes to definition and term roles, the `aria-details` would be included on the [`term`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/term_role) element with the `id` of the element with a [`definition`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/definition_role) role.

```html
<p>
  The <strong>cubic-bezier()</strong> functional notation defines a cubic
  <span role="term" aria-details="bezier bezImg">Bézier curve</span>. As these
  curves are continuous, they are often used to smooth down the start and end of
  the curve and are therefore sometimes called easing functions.
</p>

<p role="definition" id="bezier">
  A <strong>Bézier curve</strong>, (Pronounced \ ˈbe-zē-ˌā \)
  <i aria-description="English pronunciation">BEH-zee-ay</i>) is a
  mathematically described curve used in computer graphics and animation. The
  curve is defined by a set of control points with a minimum of two. Web related
  graphics and animations use Cubic Béziers, which are curves with four control
  points P<sub>0</sub>, P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, and P<sub>3</sub>.

# ARIA: aria-disabled attribute

The `aria-disabled` state indicates that the element is perceivable but disabled, so it is not editable or otherwise operable.

## Description

The `aria-disabled` attribute, when set to `true`, indicates that the element upon which it is set and all of its focusable descendants are meant to be in the disabled state. This declaration will inform people using assistive technologies, such as screen readers, that such elements are not meant to be editable or otherwise operable.

Unlike HTML's [`disabled`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#disabled) Boolean attribute, which will communicate a form control as semantically being disabled, change its styling to reflect its state and suppress all functionality along with disallowing the element's value from participating in form submission, the `aria-disabled="true"` <strong>only</strong> semantically exposes these elements as being disabled. Web developers must manually ensure such elements have their functionality suppressed when exposed to the disabled state.

When needing to disable native HTML form controls, developers will need to specify the `disabled` attribute, as it provides all of the generally expected features of disabling a control by default. However, there can be instances where elements need to be exposed as disabled, but are still available for users to find when navigating via the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key. Doing so can improve their discoverability as they will not be removed from the focus order of the web page, as `aria-disabled` does not change the focusability of such elements, nor will the elements be dimmed by default browser styling, making them easier to read. Some examples of where this may be useful include:

- The header button element associated with non-collapsible accordion panel,
- A button which is important to keep in the page's focus order, but its action is presently unavailable - such as submitting a form,
- Temporarily inactive items in a menu widget that would otherwise be skipped over via standard keyboard navigation.

In each of these cases, one may want users to find these elements through standard keyboard navigation, though the functionality of that control is removed or "disabled". Developers will still need to use JavaScript to fully disable the functionality of the element while also changing the appearance of the element so sighted users know it is disabled.

> [!NOTE]
> The state of being disabled applies to the element with `aria-disabled="true"` and all of its focusable descendants. Take care when using this attribute on container elements. Particularly in the case where a container may have both form controls and links - where the intent may be to expose the form controls as being in the disabled state, but <strong>not</strong> to communicate the links as being "disabled".

Another reason to use the `aria-disabled` attribute over the HTML `disabled` attribute is if you have created custom controls which need to be marked as disabled, but are not using an element that allows for the `disabled` attribute. For instance, in the following snippet a `<div>` was used to create a custom button which needs to be marked as disabled. However, the `<div>` element does not expect, nor respect the `disabled` attribute - even if it were to be given a `role="button"` to change its exposed ARIA role. The `aria-disabled` attribute is required to disable such custom controls.

```html
<div role="button" aria-disabled="true" tabindex="-1">Edit</div>
```

Similarly to needing to use JavaScript to ensure an element with `aria-disabled="true"` is not functional, the element will also need styling adjustments. In contrast to the HTML `disabled` attribute, where specifying it provides `:disabled` user-agent styles to be applied, adding `aria-disabled="true"` doesn't. The element can be styled with the [attribute selector](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) `[aria-disabled="true"]`.

```css
[aria-disabled="true"] {
  opacity: 0.5;
}
```

If you are purposefully using the `aria-disabled` attribute to allow for a form control to remain in the page's keyboard focus order, particularly if the element represents important content that all users should be able to perceive, then you may need to use styling that still passes color contrast requirements. For instance, a disabled button/heading that introduces a non-collapsible accordion panel is content that still needs to be legible.

```css
@media (forced-colors: active) {
  [aria-disabled="true"] {
    border-color: GrayText;
    color: GrayText;
  }
}
```

The [`forced-colors` media query](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/forced-colors) detects if the [user agent](/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent) has enabled a forced colors mode; if so, the text and border colors are both set to the [system color `greyText`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/system-color#syntax).

Another thing to keep in mind, when using `aria-disabled` over the native HTML attribute, is that the ARIA attribute will require the manual styling necessary to visually communicate the element as disabled in Windows High Contrast Mode.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using CSS's [`pointer-events: none;`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events) to make an element non-clickable, make sure you disable interactivity with JavaScript as well. `pointer-events: none;` prevents mouse clicks, but does not prevent the element from being activated via the keyboard.

```js
function onClick(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
}

function toggleDisabled(element, status, update) {
  if (status) {
    // element.input.disabled = false;
    element.setAttribute("aria-disabled", "false");
    update.textContent = "The element is now enabled.";
    element.addEventListener("click", onClick);
  } else {
    // element.input.disabled = true;
    element.setAttribute("aria-disabled", "true");
    update.textContent = "The element is now disabled.";
    element.removeEventListener("click", onClick);
  }
}
```

When toggling from `aria-disabled="true"` to `"false"`, use JavaScript to:

1. Toggle the value to `false` (or remove the attribute entirely),
2. Enable the element, and
3. Let the user know the control is now enabled.

If you used just CSS to style the disabled state using an attribute selector, the selector will no longer match and the disabled styling will no longer be in effect.

# ARIA: aria-dropeffect attribute

The global `aria-dropeffect` attribute indicates what functions may be performed when a dragged object is released on the drop target. {{deprecated_inline}}

## Description

Deprecated in ARIA 1.1, the `aria-dropeffect` property indicates what functions may be performed when a dragged object is released on the drop target. The global `aria-dropeffect` attribute provides assistive technology users the same information provided via the [`DataTransfer.dropEffect`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/DataTransfer/dropEffect) to sited users via the dropeffect icon.

Text selections, images, and links can be dragged by default. Setting the global [`draggable="true"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/draggable) attribute, part of HTML5's [Drag and Drop API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API), with a [`dragstart` event handler](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/dragstart_event), means any DOM node can be made draggable as well.

When a drag event occurs, a translucent image is generated of the dragged element which follows the user's pointer during the drag. The default image can be changed to any image with [`setDragImage`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/DataTransfer/setDragImage). Along with the default image identifying the element being dragged, there is a [`dataTransfer.dropEffect`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/DataTransfer/dropEffect) property that can be used to control the visual feedback the user is given during a drag-and-drop operation. The `aria-dropeffect` property should be used to provide assistive technology users the same feedback provided to sited users via `dataTransfer.dropEffect` property.

`dropeffect` defines which cursor the browser displays while dragging, and is set on the element on which the element may be dropped. During the drag operation, as the draggable element is dragged over different drop areas, the drag effects—both the `dataTransfer.dropeffect` and the `aria-dropeffect` should be modified to indicate the type of operation that will occur if the dragged element is released.

More than one drop effect may be supported for a given element. Therefore, the value of the `aria-dropeffect` attribute is a space separated list of functions. Functions include `copy`, `execute`, `link`, and `move`. The default is `none`, meaning there is no supported functionality in the application. Setting `aria-dropeffect="popup"` informs assistive technology users that there is a popup menu or dialog of drag operations from which the user can choose.

Including the attribute provides assistive technologies the ability to convey the possible drag options available to the assistive technology user, but doesn't add any actual functionality.

The `aria-dropeffect` property is expected to be replaced by a new feature in a future version of WAI-ARIA and is considered deprecated.

Typically, drop effect functions can only be provided once an object has been grabbed for a drag operation, as the drop effect functions available are dependent on the object being dragged. Therefore, you'll generally add `aria-dropeffect` to all the potential drop targets when the {{domxref("HTMLElement/dragstart_event", "dragstart")}} event is fired.

## Values

The value is a space separated list of possible actions. The following are the valid tokens:

- `copy`
  - : A duplicate of the source object will be dropped into the target.
- `execute`
  - : A function supported by the drop target is executed, using the drag source as an input.
- `link`
  - : A reference or shortcut to the dragged object will be created in the target object.
- `move`
  - : The source object will be removed from its current location and dropped into the target.
- `none` (default)
  - : No operation can be performed; effectively cancels the drag operation if an attempt is made to drop on this object. Ignored if combined with any other token value; for example, 'none copy' is equivalent to a 'copy' value.
- `popup`
  - : There is a popup menu or dialog that allows the user to choose one of the drag operations (copy, move, link, execute) and any other drag functionality, such as cancel.

# ARIA: aria-errormessage attribute

The `aria-errormessage` attribute on an object identifies the element(s) that provides an error message for that object.

## Description

When there is a user-created error, you want to let the user know it exists and tell them how to fix it. There are two attributes you need to use: set [`aria-invalid="true"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-invalid) to define the object as being in an error state, then add the `aria-errormessage` attribute with the value being the `id` of the element (or elements) containing the error message text for that object.

The `aria-errormessage` attribute should only be used when the value of an object is not valid; when [`aria-invalid`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-invalid) is set to `true`. If the object is valid and you include the `aria-errormessage` attribute, make sure the element referenced is hidden, as the message it contains is not relevant.

When `aria-errormessage` is relevant, the element(s) it references must be visible so users can see or hear the error message.

Often times, you will want the element with the error message to be an [ARIA live region](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Guides/Live_regions), such as when an error message is displayed to users after they have provided an invalid value. The error message should describe what is wrong and inform the user what is required to make the object valid. Adding the error message as an ARIA live region informs assistive technologies that the user may benefit from the error message content even if the error message wouldn't otherwise be conveyed to the user.

Include a visible error message and link the invalid object with the `aria-errormessage` attribute if the failure is visually apparent and an explicit description of the error is necessary.

## Example

We create some styles to:

1. Hide all error messages,
2. Make invalid objects appear invalid, and
3. Show error messages that are siblings coming after an invalid object.

We use `aria-invalid="true"` to identify invalid objects:

```css
.errormessage {
  visibility: hidden;
}

[aria-invalid="true"] {
  outline: 2px solid red;
}

[aria-invalid="true"] ~ .errormessage {
  visibility: visible;
}
```

When an object is invalid, we use JavaScript to add `aria-invalid="true"`. The above CSS makes the `.errormessage` following an invalid object become visible.

```html
<p>
  <label for="email">Email address:</label>
  <input
    type="email"
    name="email"
    id="email"
    aria-invalid="true"
    aria-errormessage="err1" />
  <span id="err1" class="errormessage">Error: Enter a valid email address</span>
</p>
```

When we went from valid to invalid, the only JavaScript change for this example was an update to `aria-invalid` on the email input object. As the error message follows the input and becomes visible and available on the accessibility tree, we are able to keep our example simple. We could have also applied an [`aria-live`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-live) property or used a live region roles such as [`alert`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/alert_role).

## Values

- ID reference list
  - : The `id` or space-separated list of element `id`s that contain the error message for the current element.

## Associated interfaces

- {{domxref("Element.ariaErrorMessageElements")}}
  - : The `ariaErrorMessageElements` property is part of each element's interface.
    Its value is an array of subclasses of {{domxref("Element")}} that reflect the `id` references in the `aria-errormessage` attribute ([with some caveats](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Reflected_attributes#reflected_element_references)).
- {{domxref("ElementInternals.ariaErrorMessageElements")}}
  - : The `ariaErrorMessageElements` property is part of each custom element's interface.
    Its value is an array of subclasses of {{domxref("Element")}} that reflect the `id` references in the `aria-errormessage` attribute ([with some caveats](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Reflected_attributes#reflected_element_references)).

# ARIA: aria-expanded attribute

The `aria-expanded` attribute is set on an element to indicate if a control is expanded or collapsed, and whether or not the controlled elements are displayed or hidden.

## Description

There are several widgets that can be expanded and collapsed, including menus, dialogs, and accordion panels. Each of these objects, in turn, has an interactive element that controls their opening and closing. The `aria-expanded` attribute is applied to this focusable, interactive control that toggles the visibility of the object.

For example, `aria-expanded` is applied to the parent item in a DOM tree to indicate whether its child branch is shown. The parent controls the visibility of the associated child branch, as well.

There are two declarations that can be applied to objects that control the visibility of another object: [`aria-controls`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-controls), or [`aria-owns`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-owns) combined with `aria-expanded`. The `aria-controls` and `aria-owns` indicate the relationship between the controlling element and the controlled element. The `aria-expanded` indicates to assistive technology whether the controlled element is expanded or collapsed.

Use the `aria-owns` property on the elements that own expandable grouping containers. If the expandable and collapsible grouping container is not owned by the element that has the `aria-expanded` attribute, use the `aria-controls` property to reference the grouping container instead.

### Buttons

A button that toggles a widget should have `aria-controls` set to the [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/id) of the toggled widget and `aria-expanded` set to the current state of the widget.

```html
<button aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="widget1">Toggle widget</button>
```

When the widget is visible, the controlling object relays that information via having `aria-expanded="true"` set on it. The accessible name of the controlling object should reflect this change.

```html
<button aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="widget1">Toggle widget</button>
```

### Menu

When a [`menu`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menu_role) is displayed, the button object that toggles the visibility of that menu has `aria-expanded="true"` set. When the menu is hidden, aria-expanded can be omitted. If specified when the menu is hidden, it should be set as `aria-expanded="false"`. When a child menu is not visible, its parent [`menuitem`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitem_role) has `aria-expanded`. It should be set to `true` when the child menu is visible.

### Combobox

By default, some roles are hidden or collapsed and other roles are open or expanded by default. Elements with role [`combobox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/combobox_role) have a default value for `aria-expanded` of `false`. When a combobox popup is not visible, the element with role `combobox` has `aria-expanded` set to `false`. This is the default state. When the popup element is visible, `aria-expanded` should be set to `true`.

```html
<label for="username">Username</label>
<input id="username" name="username" aria-describedby="username-desc" />
<button
  aria-expanded="false"
  aria-controls="username-desc"
  aria-label="Help about username"
  type="button">
  <span aria-hidden="true">?</span>
</button>
<p id="username-desc" hidden>
  Your username is the name that you use to log in to this service.
</p>
```

> [!NOTE]
> The presence of the `aria-expanded` attribute indicates control. Avoid including it on elements that do not control the expanded state of other elements.

### Treeitems

Each element with role [`treeitem`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/treeitem_role) that serves as a parent node has `aria-expanded="false"` when the node is in a closed state and `aria-expanded="true"` when the node is in an open state. End nodes, nodes with no descendant nodes, should not have the `aria-expanded` attribute because, if they were to have it, they would be incorrectly described to assistive technologies as parent nodes.

### Rows

A parent row in a [`treegrid`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/treegrid_role) is a row that can be expanded or collapsed to show or hide a set of child rows in a table or grid. Each parent row has the `aria-expanded` state set on either the row element or on a cell contained in the row. When the child rows are hidden, `aria-expanded="false"` is set. `aria-expanded="true"` is set when the child rows are displayed. Rows that do not control the display of child rows should not include the `aria-expanded` attribute at all because including the attribute defines the rows as parent rows.

## Values

- `false`
  - : The grouping element this element owns or controls is collapsed.

- `true`
  - : The grouping element this element owns or controls is expanded.

- `undefined` (default)
  - : The element does not own or control a grouping element that is expandable.

# ARIA: aria-flowto attribute

The global `aria-flowto` attribute identifies the next element (or elements) in an alternate reading order of content. This allows assistive technology to override the general default of reading in document source order at the user's discretion.

## Description

Web pages should be sequentially navigable. For this reason, developers are dissuaded from using the global [tabindex](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/tabindex) attribute which can change tab order and the CSS {{CSSXRef('order')}} property, which can change visual order from the DOM order. However, in rare circumstances a reading path different from the source order is required. For such cases, the `aria-flowto` attribute can make the content more accessible for users of assistive technologies.

The global `aria-flowto` attribute lets the author indicate to assistive technology users which element or elements might want to be focused on next, providing an alternate reading order to the source order. This allows assistive technology to read a document in an order other than the default document source reading order.

When `aria-flowto` has a single [id](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/id) reference, it allows assistive technologies to, at the user's request, go to the element targeted via that `id` instead of reading the document in the order of the DOM. When the `aria-flowto` value uses a space separated list of multiple `id` references, assistive technology can provide the user with a list of path choices, with each `id` referenced being a choice. The path choice names are determined by the accessible name of each target element of the `aria-flowto` attribute.

> [!NOTE]
> Setting `aria-flowto` does not impact the content's tab order. It only provides users the option to follow a content path that doesn't match the DOM order when using tech that supports this attribute.

## Values

- `id`
  - : The `id` of the next element in the alternate reading order.
- `id` list
  - : Space separated list of values referencing the `id` values of elements the user may want to go to next in the alternate reading order of content.

# ARIA: aria-grabbed attribute

The `aria-grabbed` state indicates an element's "grabbed" state in a drag-and-drop operation. {{deprecated_inline}}

## Description

Text selections, images, and links can be dragged by default. Setting the global [`draggable="true"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/draggable) attribute, part of HTML5's [Drag and Drop API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API), with a [`dragstart` event handler](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/dragstart_event), means any DOM node can be made draggable as well.

The `aria-grabbed` attribute was used to indicate if an element is in a "grabbed" state in a drag-and-drop operation with `aria-grabbed="true"` or if that the element is grabbable, but not currently grabbed with `aria-grabbed="false"`.

Setting `aria-grabbed="true"` indicated the element had been selected for dragging. Setting `aria-grabbed="false"` indicated that the element could be grabbed for a drag-and-drop operation, but is not currently grabbed.

When `aria-grabbed` is set to `true`, the [`aria-dropeffect`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-dropeffect) attribute of all potential drop targets should be updated with the type of function, or effect, will occur to the grabbed element when it is dropped. When no element is in a grabbed state, revert the `aria-dropeffect` attributes of all your drop targets.

The `aria-grabbed` property is expected to be replaced by a new feature in a future version of WAI-ARIA and is considered deprecated.

> [!NOTE]
> ARIA does not enable accessible functionality. ARIA only conveys the intended behavior of your functionality.

## Values

- `true`
  - : The element has been selected for dragging.
- `false`
  - : The element is not currently selected for dragging, but can be made available for dragging by setting the property to `true`.
- `undefined` (default)
  - : The element does not support being dragged

# ARIA: aria-haspopup attribute

The `aria-haspopup` attribute indicates the availability and type of interactive popup element that can be triggered by the element on which the attribute is set.

## Description

In ARIA, interactive menus, listboxes, trees, grids, and dialogs that appear on top of other content when triggered to appear are considered "popups". These popups are triggered by one or more interactive elements on the page. The availability and type of popup the interactive element will trigger should be identified with the `aria-haspopup` state.

The presence of the `aria-haspopup`, with one of six enumerated values - `menu`, `listbox`, `tree`, `grid`, `dialog`, or `true` - indicates the element can trigger a popup and what kind of popup will be displayed. In turn, the element that pops up must be of the role indicated. The value `true` is the same as `menu`. Any other value, including an empty string or other [role](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles), is treated as if `false` were set.

A [`tooltip`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tooltip_role) is not considered to be a popup in this context, as it is not interactive.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure the role of the element that serves as the container for the popup content is a [`menu`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menu_role), [`listbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/listbox_role), [`tree`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tree_role), [`grid`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/grid_role) or [`dialog`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/dialog_role) and that the value of `aria-haspopup` matches the role of the popup container.

The `aria-haspopup` state informs assistive technology users that there is a popup and the type of popup it is, but provides no interactivity. For the popup to be keyboard accessible, make sure the element with `aria-haspopup` is focusable and can trigger the popup, that there is a keyboard mechanism for opening the popup, and that the popup element manages focus of all its descendants.

> [!NOTE]
> ARIA does not enable accessible functionality. ARIA only conveys the intended behavior of your functionality.

When creating a [`menubar`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menubar_role), a parent [`menuitem`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitem_role) should have `aria-haspopup="menu"` (or `true`) set. Any button that open a menu should have a role of [`button`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/button_role) or, preferably, be a {{HTMLElement('button')}}, and also have `aria-haspopup="menu"` (or `true`) set. [`Tab`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tab_role) elements with popup menus should also have `aria-haspopup="menu"` set. Note that `menubar`s should not be used to create website navigation.

> [!NOTE]
> Elements with role [`combobox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/combobox_role) have an implicit `aria-haspopup` value of `listbox`.

## Values

- `false` (default)
  - : The element does not have a popup.
- `true`
  - : The popup is a menu.
- `menu`
  - : The popup is a menu.
- `listbox`
  - : The popup is a listbox.
- `tree`
  - : The popup is a tree.
- `grid`
  - : The popup is a grid.

# ARIA: aria-hidden attribute

The `aria-hidden` state indicates whether the element is exposed to an accessibility API.

## Description

The `aria-hidden` attribute can be used to hide non-interactive content from the accessibility API.

Adding `aria-hidden="true"` to an element removes that element and all of its children from the accessibility tree. This can improve the experience for assistive technology users by hiding:

- Purely decorative content, such as icons or images
- Duplicated content, such as repeated text
- Offscreen or collapsed content, such as menus

The presence of the `aria-hidden` attribute hides content from assistive technology but doesn't visually hide anything.

`aria-hidden="true"` should not be used on elements that can receive focus. Additionally, since this attribute is inherited by an element's children, it should not be added onto the parent or ancestor of a focusable element.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not use `aria-hidden="true"` on focusable elements.

An element's hidden status is based on whether it is rendered. Rendering is usually controlled by CSS. For example, an element whose `display` property is set to `none` via CSS is not rendered. An element is considered hidden if it, or any of its ancestors are not rendered or have their `aria-hidden` attribute value set to true. Note that an element and its children that has `aria-hidden="true"` declared on it will still be visible, unless also hidden by CSS.

Use caution when using `aria-hidden` to hide visibly rendered content from assistive technologies. You should not be hiding visible content unless doing so improves the experience for users of assistive technologies by removing redundant or extraneous content. Only when identical or equivalent meaning and functionality is exposed to assistive technologies can removing visible content from the accessibility API be considered.

> [!NOTE]
> Consider all disabilities when hiding visibly rendered content from assistive technologies. Not all users of assistive technology are visually impaired. If visible content doesn't match text content in the accessibility API, the user experience will be negatively impacted for sighted users.

On the surface, the `aria-hidden="true"` and the `role="presentation"` and its synonym `role="none"` seem similar, but the intent behind each is different.

- `aria-hidden="true"` will remove the entire element from the accessibility API.
- `role="presentation"` and `role="none"` will remove the semantic meaning of an element while still exposing it and its content to assistive technology.

`aria-hidden="true"` should not be added when:

- The HTML [`hidden`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/hidden) attribute is present
- The element or the element's ancestor is hidden with [`display: none`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display)
- The element or the element's ancestor is hidden with [`visibility: hidden`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/visibility)

In all three scenarios, the attribute is unnecessary to add because the element has already been removed from the accessibility tree. Visually hiding elements with `display` or `visibility` hides content from the screen and from assistive technologies.

Using `aria-hidden="false"` will not re-expose the element to assistive technology if any of its parents specify `aria-hidden="true"`.

## Example

Adding `aria-hidden="true"` to the icon hides the icon character from being included in the accessible name.

```html
<button>
  <span class="fa fa-tweet" aria-hidden="true"></span>
  <span class="label"> Tweet </span>
</button>
```

We have a button with [a Font Awesome icon](https://fontawesome.com/). We hide the icon from assistive technologies with `aria-hidden="true"`, as exposing the icon to assistive technologies could lead to redundancy or, if the icon doesn't have the same content as the visible text, confusion.

## Values

- `false`
  - : The element is exposed to the accessibility API as if it was rendered.
- `true`
  - : The element is hidden from the accessibility API.
- `undefined` (default)
  - : The element's hidden state is determined by the user agent based on whether it is rendered.

# ARIA: aria-invalid attribute

The `aria-invalid` state indicates the entered value does not conform to the format expected by the application.

## Description

The `aria-invalid` attribute is used to indicate that the value entered into an input field is not in a format or a value the application will accept. This may include formats such as email addresses or telephone numbers. `aria-invalid` can also be used to indicate that a required field is empty.

The `aria-invalid` attribute can be used with any typical HTML form element, and is not limited to elements that have an ARIA role assigned.

The attribute should be set with JavaScript as a result of a validation process. If a value is determined to be invalid or out-of-range, set `aria-invalid="true"` **and** tell the user there is an error. For better user experience, provide suggestions for how the error can be corrected. Do not set `aria-invalid="true"` on empty required elements until after the user attempts to submit the form. They may still be working on filling it out.

> [!NOTE]
> When `aria-invalid` is used in conjunction with the `aria-required` attribute, `aria-invalid` should not be set to true before the form is submitted - only in response to validation.

There are currently four values: in addition to `true` and `false` we have `grammar` which can be used when a grammatical error is detected and `spelling` for spelling errors. If the attribute is not present, or its value is false, or its value is an empty string, the default value of false applies. Any other value is treated as if `true` were set.

### Native HTML validation

HTML has native form validation. When a user submits a form with a control containing errors, the first form control with an invalid value displays an error message, natively.

If there is a [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/required) attribute on a form control that isn't filled out, the form will not submit, and an error message appears reading "Please fill out this field" or something similar. The messaging for native validation varies depending on the browser, and cannot be styled.

```html
<input type="number" step="2" min="0" max="100" required />
```

If the user had entered a value in the preceding input example above the maximum, below the minimum, or that doesn't match the step value, an error message would appear. If the user had entered "3", the native error message would be similar to "Please enter a valid value."

If you are creating your own form validation scripts, make sure to include `aria-invalid` on invalid form controls, along with styling (use the `[aria-invalid="true"]` attribute selector) and messaging (with [`aria-errormessage`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-errormessage)) to help users understand where the mistake is and how they can fix it.

## Values

- `grammar`
  - : A grammatical error was detected.
- `false` (default)
  - : There are no detected errors in the value.
- `spelling`
  - : A spelling error was detected.
- `true`
  - : The value entered by the user has failed validation.

Any value not in this list will be treated as `true`.

## Example

The following snippet shows a simplified version of two form fields with a validation function attached to the blur event. Note that since the default value for `aria-invalid` is `false`, it is not strictly necessary to add the attribute to input.

```html
<ul>
  <li>
    <label for="name">Full Name</label>
    <input
      type="text"
      name="name"
      id="name"
      aria-required="true"
      aria-invalid="false" />
  </li>
  <li>
    <label for="email">Email Address</label>
    <input
      type="email"
      name="email"
      id="email"
      aria-required="true"
      aria-invalid="false" />
  </li>
</ul>
```

```js
document.getElementById("name").addEventListener("blur", () => {
  checkValidity(
    "name",
    " ",
    "Invalid name entered (requires both first and last name)",
  );
});

document.getElementById("email").addEventListener("blur", () => {
  checkValidity("email", "@", "Invalid email address");
});
```

Note that it is not necessary to validate the fields immediately on blur; the application could wait until the form is submitted (though this is not necessarily recommended).

The snippet below shows a validation function, which only checks for the presence of a particular character (in the real world, validation will likely be more sophisticated):

```js
function checkValidity(id, searchTerm, msg) {
  const elem = document.getElementById(id);
  if (elem.value.includes(searchTerm)) {
    elem.setAttribute("aria-invalid", "false");
    updateAlert();
  } else {
    elem.setAttribute("aria-invalid", "true");
    updateAlert(msg);
  }
}
```

The snippet below shows the alert functions, which add (or remove) the error message:

```js
function updateAlert(msg) {
  const oldAlert = document.getElementById("alert");
  if (oldAlert) {
    oldAlert.remove();
  }

  if (msg) {
    const newAlert = document.createElement("div");
    newAlert.setAttribute("role", "alert");
    newAlert.setAttribute("id", "alert");
    const content = document.createTextNode(msg);
    newAlert.appendChild(content);
    document.body.appendChild(newAlert);
  }
}
```

Note that the alert has the ARIA role attribute set to [`alert`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/alert_role).

# ARIA: aria-keyshortcuts attribute

The global `aria-keyshortcuts` attribute indicates keyboard shortcuts that an author has implemented to activate or give focus to an element.

## Description

A keyboard shortcut is a series of one or several keys that tells software to perform a pre-programmed action. Keyboard shortcuts enable keyboard users to invoke commands using the keyboard that would otherwise require accessing a menu or using touch or a mouse. The `aria-keyshortcuts` property defines the keyboard keys that have been implemented to activate or give focus to the element on which the attribute is set.

The `aria-keyshortcuts` attribute exposes the existence of the shortcut to assistive technologies so the presence of the shortcut can be communicated to its users. Like all ARIA attributes, it has no effect on the functionality of the page; the keyboard behavior must be added via JavaScript event handlers.

Keyboard shortcuts applied to disabled elements should also be disabled. For example, when disabling an element for mouse users, remember to disable it for keyboard shortcut users.

Ensure all keyboard shortcuts are both visible to sighted users and made available to assistive technology. If your application is complex enough to need keyboard shortcuts, also known as "hot keys", include a guided tour of your application, an accessibility page documenting shortcuts and other accessibility features, a shortcut cheat sheet page or dialog pop up, or other method of making the availability of keyboard short cuts known. In addition, show the shortcut in menus and tooltips.

### Property value rules

The value of the `aria-keyshortcuts` attribute is a space-separated list of key combinations that can be pressed to activate a command or textbox widget. Each key combination includes zero, one or more modifier keys followed by exactly one non-modifier key to be pressed at the same time joined with a plus sign ("+"). The attribute value is case-insensitive.

Examples of valid keyboard shortcuts include:

```plain
aria-keyshortcuts="A"
aria-keyshortcuts="Shift+Space"
aria-keyshortcuts="Control+Alt+."
aria-keyshortcuts="Control+Shift+&#39;"
aria-keyshortcuts="alt+shift+p control+f"
aria-keyshortcuts="Meta+C Meta+Shift+C"
```

Modifier keys are keys that don't have any impact when used on their own. They are written as "Alt", "Control", "Shift", "Meta" (Command key on Mac), or "AltGraph" (Option key on Mac).

Non-modifier keys are keys that have impact when used alone, be that printing a character, moving focus, or otherwise creating a keyboard event when used. Non-modifiers that print a single character include characters like `P`, `z` and `.`.

Since the plus sign is used in writing key combinations, it is written as `plus` if used as the non-modifier. Other written-out non-modifiers include white space characters `Space`, `Tab`, and `Enter`, and all characters that result in actions, like `ArrowUp`, `PageUp`, and `Escape`.

If you want to use a character that might cause problems, like a double quote character within double quotes, escape the character: `Control+&#39;`.

Modifier keys must be listed first in each key combination. Possible key combinations include `Control+P` or `Shift+Space` and `Q`. If the full shortcut requires all three of these combinations in order, it would be written as `aria-keyshortcuts="Control+P Shift+Space Q"`. When a key combination includes more than one modifier key, the order of the modifiers doesn't matter, but they all must come first, before the non-modifier.

These two attribute declarations are equivalent.

```plain example-good
aria-keyshortcuts="Shift+Control+V"
aria-keyshortcuts="control+shift+v"
```

Note that text case doesn't matter. But order of non-modifier does.

These two attribute declarations are invalid because the non-modifier must be last.

```plain example-bad
aria-keyshortcuts="V+Shift+Control"
aria-keyshortcuts="V+Control+Shift"
```

The key combination listed must be the keys the user needs to press, not the outcome of the combined key strokes. For example, on a USA keyboard, if you need the `@` symbol, the key combination is written as `"Shift+2"`, not `"@"` nor `"Shift+@"`.

### Best practices

In trying to improve the accessibility of your sites and applications, there are some best practices to follow to ensure your "enhancements" don't negatively impact user experience. Remember, no ARIA is better than bad ARIA.

#### Don't override browser, assistive technology, or operating system shortcuts

When implementing keyboard shortcuts, make sure you don't create shortcuts that are already being used by the browser, assistive technology, or operating system, unless they are used for the same thing. For example, `"Control+P"` is used by most user-agents to initiate print functionality. Generally a web application should not create a "Control+P" shortcut as it will usurp browser functionality. There are exceptions. Web applications where printing is common, like email applications or document editors, usurping the browser's `"Control+P"` printing functionality for an application specific print flow would be expected.

Unless you're creating an HTML version of a productivity application, you should likely avoid implementing keyboard shortcut. While overriding an operating system or browser keyboard shortcut can be annoying for non-assistive technology users, if you override a screen reader's keyboard functionality you can completely shut down access for the assistive technology user. If you must create keyboard shortcuts, avoid single letter keyboard shortcuts and common screen reader keyboard shortcuts.

#### Consider language and keyboard differences

Take into account the diversity of available keyboards and the various keyboard language preferences. Modifier keys are often used to create language specific common punctuation symbols and number characters. For example, numbers, when the keyboard language preference is set to French (France), use the Shift key.

#### Don't use HTML instead

The `aria-keyshortcuts` attribute is very similar to the [problematic](https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/accesskey#spec) HTML [`accesskey`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/accesskey), which generates a keyboard shortcut for the current element. When an `accesskey` is defined for an element, the browser defines the modifiers and does all the work of handling the shortcut with no scripting required. Every browser and operating system combination has their own modifier keys for the non-modifier set in the `accesskey` attribute. What may work for one combination of operating system, assistive technology, and browser may not work with other combinations. With `aria-keyshortcuts`, the modifier keys are included in the attribute value list of key combinations and the functionality has to be scripted in.

```html
<p>
  Press the
  <strong><u>S</u></strong
  >tress reliever to relax!
</p>
<button accesskey="s">Stress reliever</button>
```

In this example, we ensured the presence of the shortcut was known to sighted users a well by highlighting the non-modifier character.

While the goal of the `accesskey` attribute matches the intention of `aria-keyshortcuts` and to do so natively, `accesskey` is rife with issues. Because of these issues, it is generally advised not to use access keys for most general-purpose websites and web apps.

In addition to poor browser support, the same concerns arise for `accesskey` as exist for `aria-keyshortcuts`:

- An accesskey value can conflict with a system or browser keyboard shortcut, or assistive technology functionality.
- Certain key values may not be present on certain keyboards, especially when internationalization is a concern. So adapting to specific languages could cause further problems.
- Values that rely on numbers may be confusing to individuals experiencing cognitive concerns, where the number doesn't have a logical association with the functionality it triggers.
- Informing the user that shortcuts are present, so that they are aware of the functionality. If the system lacks a method of notifying the user about this feature, the user might accidentally activate a shortcut.

## Values

- `<string>`
  - : The space-separated list of key combinations that, when pressed, perform the action.

## Example

In this example, the `aria-keyshortcuts` attribute on the element is set to "Alt+Shift+A".

```html
<a href="#content" aria-keyshortcuts="Alt+Shift+A">Skip to content</a>
```

# ARIA: aria-label attribute

The `aria-label` attribute defines a string value that can be used to name an element, as long as the element's role does not [prohibit naming](#associated_roles).

## Description

Sometimes, the default {{Glossary("accessible_name", "accessible name")}} of an element is missing or the accessible name does not accurately describe the contents of the element and there is no content visible in the DOM that can be associated with the object to give it meaning. A common example of such an element is a button containing an SVG icon without any text.

In cases where an element that is not part of the [prohibited list](#associated_roles), has no accessible name or an accessible name is not accurate and there is no content visible in the DOM that can be referenced via the [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) attribute, the `aria-label` attribute can be used to define a string that labels the interactive element on which it is set. This provides the element an accessible name.

The code below shows an example of how to use the `aria-label` attribute to provide an accessible name for a `<button>` element. The button in this example contains an SVG graphic and lacks textual content, making the `aria-label` essential for screen reader users to understand its function, which in this case is "Close".

```html
<button aria-label="Close">
  <svg
    aria-hidden="true"
    focusable="false"
    width="17"
    height="17"
    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    <path
      d="m.967 14.217 5.8-5.906-5.765-5.89L3.094.26l5.783 5.888L14.66.26l2.092 2.162-5.766 5.889 5.801 5.906-2.092 2.162-5.818-5.924-5.818 5.924-2.092-2.162Z"
      fill="black" />
  </svg>
</button>
```

```js
document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", () => {
  myDialog.close();
});
```

> [!NOTE]
> `aria-label` is intended for naming elements where the implicit or explicit role does not prohibit naming. It is strongly recommended to prioritize the use of `aria-labelledby` over `aria-label` if a visible label exists for the element to reference and receive its name from.

Most content has an accessible name generated from its immediate wrapping element's text content. Accessible names can also be created by certain attributes or associated elements.

By default, a button's accessible name is the content between the opening and closing {{HTMLElement('button')}} tags, an image's accessible name is the content of its [`alt`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/img#alt) attribute, and a form input's accessible name is the content of the associated {{HTMLElement('label')}} element.

If none of these options are available or if the default accessible name is not appropriate, use the `aria-label` attribute to define the accessible name of an element.

> [!NOTE]
> While `aria-label` can be used on any element that can have an accessible name, in practice however, it is supported only on interactive elements, [widgets](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles#2._widget_roles), [landmarks](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles#3._landmark_roles), images, and iframes.

When using `aria-label`, you also need to consider [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby):

- `aria-label` can be used in cases where text that could label the element is _not_ visible. If there is visible text that labels an element, use `aria-labelledby` instead.
- The purpose of `aria-label` is the same as `aria-labelledby`. Both provide an accessible name for an element. If there is no visible name for the element you can reference, use `aria-label` to provide the user with a recognizable accessible name. If label text is available in the DOM and it's possible to reference it for an acceptable user experience, prefer to use `aria-labelledby`. Don't use both on the same element because `aria-labelledby` will take precedence over `aria-label` if both are applied.

Keep the following additional guidelines in mind when using `aria-label`:

- The `aria-label` attribute can be used with regular, semantic HTML elements; it is not limited to elements that have an [ARIA `role`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles) assigned.
- Don't "overuse" `aria-label`. Remember that it's primarily for assistive technologies. To provide additional instructions or to clarify the UI, use visible text with `aria-describedby` or [`aria-description`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-description), not `aria-label`. Instructions should be accessible to all users, not just to those with screen readers (or preferably, make your UI more intuitive).

  > [!NOTE]
  > Since `aria-label` content isn't displayed outside assistive technologies, consider making important information visible for all users.

- Not all elements can be given an accessible name. Neither `aria-label` nor `aria-labelledby` should be used with inline structural roles such as with `code`, `term`, and `emphasis`, and roles not mapped to the accessibility API, including `none`. The `aria-label` attribute is intended for elements including links, videos, form controls, and those with [landmark roles](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles#3._landmark_roles) or [widget roles](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles#2._widget_roles); `aria-label` provides an accessible name when no visible label exists in the DOM.
- If you assign a `title` to an {{HTMLElement('iframe')}}, define an `alt` attribute for an {{HTMLElement('img')}}, or add {{HTMLElement('label')}} for an {{HTMLElement('input')}}, `aria-label` is not necessary. However, if an `aria-label` attribute is present, it will take precedence over the iframe's `title`, the image's `alt`, or the input's `<label>` text as the accessible name for that element.

## Values

- `<string>`
  - : A string of text that will be the accessible name for the object.

## Associated interfaces

- {{domxref("Element.ariaLabel")}}
  - : The [`ariaLabel`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/ariaLabel) property, part of the {{domxref("Element")}} interface, reflects the value of the `aria-label` attribute.

# ARIA: aria-labelledby attribute

The `aria-labelledby` attribute identifies the element (or elements) that labels the element it is applied to.

## Description

The `aria-labelledby` property enables authors to reference other elements on the page to define an accessible name. This is useful when using elements that don't have native support for associating elements to provide an accessible name.

Some elements get their [accessible name](https://w3c.github.io/accname/#dfn-accessible-name) from their inner content. For example, the accessible name for a {{HTMLElement('button')}}, {{HTMLElement('a')}}, or {{HTMLElement('td')}} comes from the text between the opening and closing tags. Other elements, such as form {{HTMLElement('textarea')}}, {{HTMLElement('fieldset')}}, and {{HTMLElement('table')}} get their accessible name from the content of associated elements; for these elements, the accessible name comes from the {{HTMLElement('label')}} with a `for` attribute, {{HTMLElement('legend')}}, and {{HTMLElement('caption')}} respectively.

All interactive elements must have an accessible name. `aria-labelledby` can be used to reference another element to define its accessible name, when an element's accessible name needs to use content from elsewhere in the DOM.

If there is no content that can be referenced to create an accessible name, the [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) attribute should be used instead.

The purpose of `aria-labelledby` is the same as that of `aria-label`. It provides the user with a recognizable, accessible name for an interactive element. If an element has both attributes set, `aria-labelledby` will be used. `aria-labelledby` takes precedence over all other methods of providing an accessible name, including `aria-label`, {{HTMLElement('label')}}, and the element's inner text.

The `aria-labelledby` and [`aria-describedby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-describedby) attributes both reference other elements to calculate text alternatives. `aria-labelledby` should reference brief text that provides the element with an accessible name. `aria-describedby` is used to reference longer content that provides a description. If there is no element in the DOM that provides a brief label appropriate for an accessible name for an interactive element, use `aria-label` to define the accessible name for an interactive element.

> [!NOTE]
> While in American English, "labeled" is spelled with one "l", the "labelledby" spelling has been established and is the spelling used in accessibility APIs.

The following example uses `aria-labelledby` to provide an accessible name for a checkbox input by using the text content of a sibling element:

```html
<span
  role="checkbox"
  aria-checked="false"
  tabindex="0"
  aria-labelledby="tac"></span>
<span id="tac">I agree to the Terms and Conditions.</span>
```

Note that while using `aria-labelledby` is similar in this situation to using an HTML {{HTMLElement('label')}} element with the `for` attribute, there are some very important differences. The `aria-labelledby` attribute only defines the accessible name. It doesn't provide any of `<label>`'s other functionality, such as making clicking on the labeling element activate the input it is associated with. That has to be added back in with JavaScript.

Fortunately, the HTML {{HTMLElement('input')}} with `type="checkbox"` works with native `<label>`. When feasible, use the following:

```html
<label for="tac">
  <input id="tac" type="checkbox" name="terms-and-conditions" />
  I agree to the Terms and Conditions.
</label>
<p><a href="tac.html">Read our Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>
```

### Benefits (and drawbacks)

1. The `aria-labelledby` property has the highest precedence when browsers calculate accessible names. Be aware that it overrides other methods of naming the element, including `aria-label`, other naming attributes, and even the element's contents.

   ```html
   <button aria-label="Blue" aria-labelledby="color">Red</button>
   <span id="color">Yellow</span>
   ```

   In this example, that accessible name is "Yellow".

2. The `aria-labelledby` property takes as value a space-separated id reference list, which means you can combine more than one element into a single accessible name. You can include the [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/id) of the element itself to reference its own content.

   ```html
   <h2 id="attr" class="article-title">13 ARIA attributes you need to know</h2>
   <p>
     There are over 50 ARIA states and properties, but 13 of them stand out…
     <a href="13.html" id="rm13" aria-labelledby="rm13 attr">read more</a>
   </p>
   ```

   In this example, the accessible name is "read more 13 ARIA attributes you need to know".

3. The `aria-labelledby` property value order matters. When more than one element is referenced by `aria-labelledby`, the content from each referenced element is combined in the order that they are referenced in the `aria-labelledby` value. Had we written `aria-labelledby="attr rm13">`, the accessible name would have been "13 ARIA attributes you need to know read more".

4. The `aria-labelledby` property ignores repeated `id`s in its value. If an element is referenced more than one time, only the first reference is processed. `aria-labelledby="attr attr rm13 rm13">` is treated as `aria-labelledby="attr rm13">`

5. The `aria-labelledby` property value can include content from elements that aren't even visible. While you should provide assistive technology users with the same content as all other users, you can include content from elements with the HTML [`hidden`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/hidden) attribute, CSS [`display: none`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display), and CSS [`visibility: hidden`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/visibility) in the calculated name string.

6. The `aria-labelledby` property incorporates the value of input elements. If the value references an `<input>`, the current value of the form control is included in the calculated name string, changing if the value is updated.

7. The `aria-labelledby` property cannot be chained. If an element with `aria-labelledby` references another element that also has `aria-labelledby`, the `aria-labelledby` attribute on the referenced element is ignored.

> [!WARNING]
> Because calculating the name of an element with `aria-labelledby` can be complex and reference hidden content, testing with assistive technologies to ensure the expected name is presented to users is very important.

# ARIA: aria-level attribute

The `aria-level` attribute defines the hierarchical level of an element within a structure.

## Description

Levels of hierarchy appear in headings, trees, nested grid, nested tablists, and more. If the DOM ancestry does not accurately represent the level, the `aria-level` attribute should be used to define the hierarchical level elements within their hierarchical structures. Levels increase with depth. The value for aria-level is an integer greater than or equal to `1`.

When it comes to the headings in a document structure, you can have first-level headings, second-level headings, third-level headings, etc. In trees, you have the root element, its children, the children's children (or grandchildren), and so on.

The `aria-level` attribute exposes hierarchy to assistive technologies so it can be communicated to the users. Like all ARIA attributes, it has no impact on the user agent and therefore no impact on the user agent's determination of the document structure.

If the DOM ancestry accurately represents the level, the user agent can calculate the level of an item from the document structure, making `aria-level` not only redundant but a risk of creating misinformation. `aria-level` should really only be used to provide an explicit indication of level when it is not possible to calculate from the document structure. Test to see if this attribute is needed. If the user agent can calculate the level, it is best to omit the `aria-level` attribute.

### With `heading` role

The `aria-level` attribute is a required attribute of the [`heading`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/heading_role) role which indicates to assistive technologies that the element should be treated as a heading. `<div role="heading" aria-level="1">` defines the `<div>` as being the main heading of the page. A level 2 heading, defined with `aria-level="2"` would be the first subsection, a level 3 is a subsection of that, and so on.

```html
<div role="heading" aria-level="3">Heading for this sub section</div>
```

Opt for using the {{htmlelement("Heading_Elements", "h1")}} through {{htmlelement("Heading_Elements", "h6")}} elements instead.

### Within `treegrid` role

In the case of a [`treegrid`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/treegrid_role), `aria-level` is supported on elements with the role [`row`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/row_role), not elements with role [`gridcell`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/gridcell_role). Rows act as leaf nodes within the vertical orientation of the grid. Gridcells are leaf nodes within the horizontal orientation of each row. `Aria-level` is not supported on cells within rows. So, in treegrids, the `aria-level` attribute is applied to the element with the role `row`.

If a complete set of available nodes is not present in the DOM due to dynamic loading as the user moves focus in or scrolls the tree, each node has `aria-level`, [`aria-setsize`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-setsize), and [`aria-posinset`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-posinset) included.

## Values

- `<integer>`
  - : An integer greater than or equal to 1

## Associated interfaces

- {{domxref("Element.ariaLevel")}}
  - : The [`ariaLevel`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/ariaLevel) property, part of the {{domxref("Element")}} interface, reflects the value of the `aria-level` attribute.

# ARIA: aria-live attribute

The global `aria-live` attribute indicates that an element will be updated, and describes the types of updates the user agents, assistive technologies, and user can expect from the live region.

## Description

When content changes after initial load, assistive technology (AT) users may not "see" the changes. Some changes are important. Others are not. The `aria-live` attribute enables developers to inform the user of updates and choose, based on importance and urgency, whether to immediately, proactively, or passively inform AT users of changes to the content.

If a section of the screen updates, if it's styled in a way to be noticeable, most sighted users will generally notice live updates. Screen readers, on the other hand, only focus on one part of the page at a time; and that part may not be where the update is. The `aria-live` attribute provides a way for developers to announce such changes to AT based on event triggers set by the developer rather than by user initiated actions so they are made aware that the content has changed.

```html
<div id="announce" aria-live="polite"></div>
```

The `aria-live` attribute is set on an **empty** element. When an update to the page occurs, the empty element with that `aria-live` attribute should be updated with a brief announcement informing the user an update has been made.

```html
<div id="announce" aria-live="polite">
  <p>This message is announced.</p>
</div>
```

When the accessibility API recognizes a change to the live region above, it will announce the contents of that live region based on the value of the attribute. The element is **not** given focus.

If you want all the contents of the live region to be read, use the [`aria-atomic`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-atomic). Use [`aria-relevant`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-relevant) to define only the sections of an update that need to be reread to the user. Use [`aria-busy`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-busy) to prevent announcements while updates are still being made.

### Choosing the `aria-live` value

As some assistive technology users can't "see" live updates, the `aria-live` attribute is used to define what updated information the user should be:

- Made aware of immediately,
- Informed about if the opportunity avails itself, and
- Proactively informed about but can learn when they choose to focus on the updated area.

`aria-live`'s value describes the types of updates the user agents, assistive technologies, and user can expect from the live region, and is used to express degrees of importance.

When `aria-live`'s attribute is set to `polite`, assistive technologies will notify users of updates but generally do not interrupt the current task, with the updates having a low priority. When set to `assertive`, assistive technologies immediately notify the user, potentially clearing the speech queue of previous updates.

Screen readers buffer content when the page is loaded. Because of this, content added after the initial accessibility tree is built may not be noticed as AT users start consuming content before dynamic widgets are populated—users may not know about the page or view content updating as widgets finish loading. In this situation you can let users know the page has been updated by setting `aria-live="polite"`.

Fully populated pages may have updates too. Examples are content like real-time sports scores, news crawlers, and stock market tickers. Unless these kinds of updates are the main function of the page, you likely do not want to inform the user every time it updates, but do want to inform them the widget does get updated. Here, you would set `aria-live="off"`. In these scenarios there is no reason to inform the user of updates unless they are focused on the live region.

Some live updates are important and time sensitive. For example, if you are selling concert tickets and the user has a limited time to make the purchase, you don't want to wait until a lull in activity to tell them their time is almost up (or already over). When being informed as soon as possible is necessary, set `aria-live="assertive"`. If the updated information is an [`alert`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/alert_role), the `aria-live` attribute is not needed.

In this time-limit scenario, to be accessible, you need to also [provide a way for users to extend the time available or turn the timer off completely](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/timing-adjustable.html).

### Using `aria-live`

A live region includes the element and all its descendants. When not set on updating content, `aria-live`'s value comes from the nearest ancestor with a valid `aria-live` attribute value set. When set to `off`, or when the attribute is omitted altogether on the updated element and all the ancestor nodes in the DOM tree, the user is not informed. Users will still be able to hear the updates if they navigate to the live region, however.

> [!WARNING]
> Because an interruption may disorient users or cause them to not complete their current task, don't use the `assertive` value unless the interruption is imperative.

## Values

- `assertive`
  - : Indicates that updates to the region have the highest priority and should be presented to the user immediately.
- `off` (default)
  - : Indicates that updates to the region should **not** be presented to the user unless the user is currently focused on that region.
- `polite`
  - : Indicates that updates to the region should be presented at the next graceful opportunity, such as at the end of speaking the current sentence or when the user pauses typing.

# ARIA: aria-modal attribute

The `aria-modal` attribute indicates whether an element is modal when displayed.

## Description

A section of content is "modal" means navigation is limited to the area itself and the background (the ancestors and siblings of the modal) is hidden. Setting `aria-modal="true"` on [`dialog`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/dialog_role) and [`alertdialog` role](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/alertdialog_role) containers indicates the presence of a "modal" element to users of assistive technology, but does not actually make the element modal. The features that make the element actually modal must be implemented by the developer.

> [!NOTE]
> ARIA only modifies the accessibility tree, modifying how assistive technology presents the content to your users. ARIA doesn't change anything about an element's function or behavior. To create a modal effect you must use JavaScript to manage behavior, focus, and ARIA states.

Relevant only on `dialog` and `alertdialog` containers, setting `aria-modal="true"` tells assistive technologies to let the user know the ability to interact with, or access other content on the page requires the modal dialog to be closed or otherwise lose focus.

Modal dialogs are when content is displayed and the user's interaction is limited to only that section until it is dismissed.

When creating modal dialogs, `aria-modal="true"` tells assistive technologies that the windows underneath the current dialog are not part of the modal content.

When a modal element is displayed, focus should be placed in the modal. Focus needs to be "trapped" inside the modal when it is visible, until it is dismissed. Assistive technology (<abbr>AT</abbr>) can then navigate the modal's content and understand the scope of the modal's content. The `aria-modal` attribute helps AT communicate the bounds of the modal and distinguishes it from the rest of the page's content. When dismissed, focus should return to the element that triggered the modal.

Ensure the modal is controllable using only its descendant elements. If a modal dialog has a close button, the button should be a descendant contained with the modal container in the DOM.

When a modal element is displayed, authors **should** mark all other contents as inert (such as "inert subtrees" in HTML). Disabled content is not inert content. Inert content cannot be interacted with using both normal and specialized browsing modes such as caret browsing, which allow an assistive technology user to explore a page in detail. This includes disabled content, whose content may provide meaning.

The [`inert`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/inert) attribute is a boolean attribute that indicates, by its presence, that the element and all its shadow-including descendants are to be made inert.

Including `aria-modal="true"` on a [`dialog`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/dialog_role) or [`alertdialog`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/alertdialog_role), removes the requirement of putting [`aria-hidden`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-hidden) on background content, as the `aria-modal` informs assistive technologies that content outside a dialog is inert. Note that while support for the {{HTMLElement("dialog")}} element is good, thoroughly testing your implementation is vitally important.

If a dialog is not modal — there is no inert background and focus isn't confined to the dialog — either include `aria-modal="false"` or omit the attribute altogether.

## Example

```html
<div id="backdrop" class="no-scroll">
  <div
    role="alertdialog"
    aria-modal="true"
    aria-labelledby="dialog_label"
    aria-describedby="dialog_desc">
    <h2 id="dialog_label">Confirmation</h2>
    <div id="dialog_desc">
      <p>Are you sure you want to delete this file?</p>
    </div>
    <button id="close-btn" type="button">No. Close this popup.</button>
    <button id="confirm-btn" type="button">Yes. Delete the file.</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
document.getElementById("close-btn").addEventListener("click", () => {
  closeDialog();
});

document.getElementById("confirm-btn").addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  deleteFile();
});
```

This partial example includes an `alertdialog` nested in a full-screen, non-scrollable backdrop.

The [`role="alertdialog"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/alertdialog_role) identifies the element that serves as the alert dialog container. The [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) provides the alert dialog an accessible name by referring to the element that provides the alert dialog title. The [`aria-describedby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-describedby) attribute gives the alert dialog an {{glossary("accessible description")}} by referring to the alert dialog content that describes the primary message or purpose of the alert dialog.

The `aria-modal="true"` informs the assistive technology user that the content underneath the dialog is not interactive so long as the element with a declaration of `role="alertdialog"` has focus.

The `aria-modal` attribute exposes the existence of the modal to assistive technologies so the disabling of the content behind the modal can be communicated to AT users. Like all ARIA attributes, `aria-modal` itself has no effect on the page's functionality; focus management and disabling, interactivity on background elements, and the ability to remove focus from the alertdialog must all be managed with JavaScript.

- `false` (default)
  - : Element is not modal.
- `true`
  - : Element is modal.

# ARIA: aria-multiline attribute

The `aria-multiline` attribute indicates whether a `textbox` accepts multiple lines of input or only a single line.

## Description

The default behavior of the <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Return</kbd> key differs between single-line and multi-line text fields. When user focus is in a single-line `{{htmlelement("input/text", '&lt;input type="text"&gt;')}}`, an <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Return</kbd> keystroke usually submits the form.

When user focus is in a multi-line {{HTMLElement('textarea')}}, the keystroke inserts a line break. Only relevant for elements with the [`textbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/textbox_role) role set, the `aria-multiline` attribute indicates to assistive technologies whether that text box accepts multiple lines of input or only a single line, setting expectations as to what type of data to enter and what those keystroke will do.

> [!NOTE]
> Where possible, use the HTML {{HTMLElement('input')}} or the {{HTMLElement('textarea')}}, as these have built in semantics and behaviors, do not require ARIA attributes or scripting, and have keyboard support built in.

If the `aria-multiline="true"` is set, it means the textbox widget will accept line breaks within the input, similar to the HTML {{HTMLElement('textarea')}}. Elements with a role of `textbox` that do not have the attribute, or with the value set to `false`, are simple text boxes.

Be aware of focus and keystrokes when designing text boxes. ARIA only modifies the accessibility tree and therefore how assistive technology presents the textbox to your users. ARIA doesn't change anything about an element's default function or behavior. When not using semantic HTML elements for their intended purpose and default functionality, you must use JavaScript to manage behavior and functionality, including responding to keystroke events.

## Values

- `true`
  - : The text box accepts multiple lines of input.

- `false`
  - : The text box only accepts a single line of input.

# ARIA: aria-multiselectable attribute

The `aria-multiselectable` attribute indicates that the user may select more than one item from the current selectable descendants.

## Description

The default behavior of selection lists, such as {{HTMLElement('select')}}, is to be able to choose only one item or option. By default or by convention, when a user is presented with list from which they must select an item, they assume they can only select a single item unless otherwise notified. The `aria-multiselectable` attribute is the way to inform assistive technology users that they may select more than one item from the current selectable items if they so choose. Lists and trees are examples of roles that might allow users to select more than one item at a time.

> [!NOTE]
> When allowing for multiple selections, inform the user that multiple values are allowed and provide directions on how to provide multiple values, such as "to select more than one value, keep the control key pressed during selection."

### Used with `aria-selected`

When the user does select one or more items, remember to set the selected descendants as selected with [`aria-selected="true"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-selected), and selectable descendants that are not selected have `aria-selected="false"` set. If an element is not selectable, omit the `aria-selected` attribute altogether as its presence informs the user the item is selectable.

If a tree, grid, tab list, or list box supports selection of more than one node, the element with role [`grid`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/grid_role), [`listbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/listbox_role), [`tablist`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tablist_role), or [`tree`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tree_role) has `aria-multiselectable` set to `true`. Otherwise, `aria-multiselectable` is either set to `false` or the default value of false is implied.

## Example

```html
<p id="colorOptions">Choose the colors for your flag.</p>
<ul
  tabindex="0"
  role="listbox"
  aria-labelledby="colorOptions"
  aria-multiselectable="true">
  <li id="red" role="option" aria-selected="false">Red</li>
  <li id="orange" role="option" aria-selected="false">Orange</li>
  <li id="yellow" role="option" aria-selected="false">Yellow</li>
  <li id="green" role="option" aria-selected="false">Green</li>
  <li id="blue" role="option" aria-selected="false">Blue</li>
  <li id="purple" role="option" aria-selected="false">Purple</li>
  <li id="magenta" role="option" aria-selected="false">Hot pink</li>
  <li id="lightpink" role="option" aria-selected="true">Light pink</li>
  <li id="white" role="option" aria-selected="true">White</li>
  <li id="lightblue" role="option" aria-selected="true">Light blue</li>
  <li id="black" role="option" aria-selected="false">Black</li>
  <li id="brown" role="option" aria-selected="false">Brown</li>
</ul>
```

This listbox supports multiple selection so we set the element with role `listbox` with `aria-multiselectable="true"`. All selected options have `aria-selected` set to `true`. All options that are not selected but are selectable have `aria-selected` set to false. Had we included options that were disabled or otherwise not selectable, we would have omitted the `aria-selected` attribute altogether. Including the attribute, even with no value or explicitly set to `false` indicates to assistive technology users that the item is selectable.

The first rule of ARIA use is "if you can use a native feature with the semantics and behavior you require already built in, instead of repurposing an element and **adding** an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible, then do so." Instead of creating an unordered list requiring [`tabindex`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/tabindex), ARIA and JavaScript to turn text into selectable options, we could have used a native multiselect: the {{htmlelement('select')}} element has a Boolean [`multiple`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/select#multiple) attribute. If included, the user can select multiple options. If not, only a single option can be selected.

```html
<label for="flagcolors"> Choose the colors for your flag. </label>
<select multiple id="flagcolors">
  <option value="red">Red</option>
  <option value="orange">Orange</option>
  <option value="yellow">Yellow</option>
  <option value="green">Green</option>
  <option value="blue">Blue</option>
  <option value="purple">Purple</option>
  <option value="magenta">Hot pink</option>
  <option value="lightpink" selected>Light pink</option>
  <option value="white" selected>White</option>
  <option value="lightblue" selected>Light blue</option>
  <option value="black">Black</option>
  <option value="brown">Brown</option>
</select>
```

This HTML `<select>` version is accessible and interactive, and needs no ARIA or JavaScript to function.

If the above isn't stylable to your liking, you can also create a list of selectable options with HTML checkboxes, which is also semantic, focusable, and infinitely stylable with CSS:

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>Choose the colors for your flag.</legend>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <label><input type="checkbox" name="fc" value="red" />Red</label>
    </li>
    <li>
      <label><input type="checkbox" name="fc" value="orange" />Orange</label>
    </li>
    <li>
      <label><input type="checkbox" name="fc" value="yellow" />Yellow</label>
    </li>
    <li>
      <label><input type="checkbox" name="fc" value="green" />Green</label>
    </li>
    <li>
      <label><input type="checkbox" name="fc" value="blue" />Blue</label>
    </li>
    <li>
      <label><input type="checkbox" name="fc" value="purple" />Purple</label>
    </li>
    <li>
      <label><input type="checkbox" name="fc" value="magenta" />Hot pink</label>
    </li>
    <li>
      <label
        ><input type="checkbox" name="fc" value="lightpink" checked />Light
        pink</label
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <label
        ><input type="checkbox" name="fc" value="white" checked />White</label
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <label
        ><input type="checkbox" name="fc" value="lightblue" checked />Light
        blue</label
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <label><input type="checkbox" name="fc" value="black" />Black</label>
    </li>
    <li>
      <label><input type="checkbox" name="fc" value="brown" />Brown</label>
    </li>
  </ul>
</fieldset>
```

Instead of `aria-selected="true"`, include the [`checked`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/checkbox#checked) attribute. The browser does the rest.

# ARIA: aria-orientation attribute

The `aria-orientation` attribute indicates whether the element's orientation is horizontal, vertical, or unknown/ambiguous.

## Description

It may be important for the user to know the orientation to know how to navigate certain widgets, as orientation impacts the expected behaviors of the left, right, up and down arrows. The `aria-orientation` attribute is used to indicate to assistive technology users whether an element's orientation is `horizontal` or `vertical`, or `undefined`.

Several widgets have default orientations:

Horizontal by default:

- [`slider`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/slider_role),
- [`tablist`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tablist_role)
- [`toolbar`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/toolbar_role)
- [`menubar`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menubar_role)

Vertical by default:

- [`scrollbar`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/scrollbar_role)
- [`tree`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tree_role)
- [`listbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/listbox_role)
- [`menu`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menu_role)

Each [`separator`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/separator_role) should have `aria-orientation` consistent with the separator's orientation.

When nodes in a tree are arranged horizontally instead of its default vertical orientation, or when a tab list is vertical instead of its default horizontal, the down arrow performs as a right arrow normally would, and the up arrow performs as a left arrow normally would. In these instances, assistive technology users need to know the widget's orientation so as to navigate correctly.

Up and down arrows are generally available for normal browser scrolling, even when focus is inside a tree or tab list. Include `aria-orientation` to enable alerting users when a widget doesn't have the default, expected orientation and associated navigation.

Always remember that ARIA only modifies how assistive technology presents content to your users; altering the behavior of arrow keys requires JavaScript.

## Values

- `horizontal`
  - : The element is oriented horizontally.
- `undefined` (default)
  - : The element's orientation is unknown/ambiguous.
- `vertical`
  - : The element is oriented vertically.

# ARIA: aria-owns attribute

The `aria-owns` attribute identifies an element (or elements) in order to define a visual, functional, or contextual relationship between a parent and its child elements when the DOM hierarchy cannot be used to represent the relationship.

## Description

Every element is the parent, sibling, or child of another element. The document object, made up of HTML elements and text nodes, is the basis of the DOM tree. The Accessibility Object Model (<abbr>AOM</abbr>) relies on a well-built DOM to enable assistive technologies to relay meaningful information about a document's contents to users.

There are circumstances where the layout that appears on screen may differ from the underlying DOM structure due to the ability of JavaScript to alter content and CSS to alter layout. When this is the case, the `aria-owns` attribute can be used to recreate a meaningful relationship for assistive technology that consumes the DOM.

When elements appear to be related visually but are not associated in the DOM, the `aria-owns` attribute enables creating the relationship that appears on screen in the accessibility layer for use by assistive technology. The **only** reason to include `aria-owns` is to expose a parent/child contextual relationship to assistive technology when the DOM's construction can't provide that relationship.

An "owning element" is any DOM ancestor of an element. If an element visually, functionally, or contextually appears to "own" (be an ancestor of) an element, but isn't actually an ancestor of the element in the DOM, include the `aria-owns` to create that relationship. Add the attribute to the owning element with reference to the non-child owned element (or elements) to tell assistive technology that an element should be treated as a child.

Referencing the ID of one or more elements allows any element to "own" any other element with an `aria-owns` declaration. The value of the `aria-owns` attribute is a space-separated ID reference list that references the IDs of one or more elements in the document.

> [!NOTE]
> An "owned" element is any DOM descendant of the element, any element specified as a child via `aria-owns`, or any DOM descendant of the owned child. The `aria-owns`-owned element should be an element that belongs to a separate parent tree in the DOM but should be treated as a child of the current element.

Do not use `aria-owns` as a replacement for the DOM hierarchy. If the relationship is represented in the DOM, do not use `aria-owns`.

A child element is owned by its DOM parent by default: in this case, `aria-owns` should not be used. Avoid using the `aria-owns` attribute to rearrange existing child elements into a different order.

When using `aria-owns`, make sure you [manage focus order](https://css-tricks.com/focus-management-and-inert/). Ensure the visual focus order matches this assistive technology reading order.

An example of when to use `aria-owns` includes pop-up sub-menus that visually appear positioned near a parent menu, but cannot be nested in the DOM within the parent menu because it would affect the visual presentation. In this case, use `aria-owns` to present the sub-menu as a child of the parent menu to a screen reader.

> [!NOTE]
> The `aria-owns` attribute should only be used when the parent/child relationship cannot be determined from the DOM.

If an element has both `aria-owns` and DOM children, the order of the child elements:

1. The actual DOM children first,
2. Then the elements referenced in `aria-owns`.

This order can be changed by including the ID references to the actual DOM children in the `aria-owns` value.

The {{CSSXRef('order')}} property, part of flex or grid layouts, can be used to change the order of flex and grid items making them appear in a different order from their order in the source document, creating a divergence of the logical order of elements. While it may be tempting to order the accessibility layer to match order changes created with the CSS {{CSSXref('order')}} property, avoiding both the `order` property and the `aria-owns` attribute is the best option.

Make sure your owned elements have only one owner. Do not specify the `id` of an element in more than one other element's `aria-owns` attribute. An element can have only one owner.

> [!WARNING]
> While [`aria-owns` is now supported](https://a11ysupport.io/tech/aria/aria-owns_attribute) in all modern browsers, `aria-owns` may not be exposed to users of macOS and iOS using VoiceOver prior to iOS 17.3 and macOS 14.3.

# ARIA: aria-placeholder attribute

The `aria-placeholder` attribute defines a short hint (a word or short phrase) intended to help the user with data entry when a form control has no value. The hint can be a sample value or a brief description of the expected format.

## Description

A placeholder is text that appears in the form control when it has no value set. The HTML [`placeholder`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#placeholder) attribute enables providing a sample value or a brief description of the expected format for several HTML {{HTMLElement('input')}} types and {{HTMLElement('textarea')}}.

If you are creating a `textbox` using any other element, `placeholder` is not supported. That is where `aria-placeholder` comes into play. The `aria-placeholder` attribute can be used to defines a short hint to help the user understand what type of data is expected when a non-semantic form control has no value.

```html
<span id="date-of-birth">Birthday</span>
<div
  contenteditable
  role="textbox"
  aria-labelledby="date-of-birth"
  aria-placeholder="MM-DD-YYYY">
  MM-DD-YYYY
</div>
```

The placeholder hint should be shown to the user whenever the control's value is empty, including when a value is deleted.

> [!NOTE]
> ARIA is only modify the accessibility tree for an element and therefore how assistive technology presents the content to your users. ARIA doesn't change anything about an elements function or behavior. When not using semantic HTML elements for their intended purpose and default functionality, you must use JavaScript to manage behavior.

The `aria-placeholder` is used in addition to, not instead of, a label. They have different purposes and different functionality. A label explains what kind of information is expected. Placeholder text provides a hint about the expected value.

> [!WARNING]
> Using a placeholder instead of a visible label harms accessibility and usability for many users including older users and users with cognitive, mobility, fine motor skill and vision impairments. Labels are better: they are always visible and they provide for a larger hit region to focus on the control. Placeholders have several drawbacks: they disappear when the control has any value including just white space, they can confuse users into thinking the value is pre-filled, and the default color has insufficient contrast.

> [!NOTE]
> Placeholders should only be used to show an example of the type of data that should be entered into a form; they don't replace a proper label.

## Values

- `<string>`
  - : The word or short phrase to display in a control when the control has no value.

# ARIA: aria-posinset attribute

The `aria-posinset` attribute defines an element's number or position in the current set of listitems or treeitems when not all items are present in the DOM.

## Description

Short for "position in set", the `aria-posinset` attribute defines the position of the element within the whole set of listitems or treeitems when only a subset of the items are present in the DOM.

If all the items in a list are present in the DOM, the browser can calculate the total and the position of each, making `aria-posinset` unnecessary. When only a portion of a set is in the DOM, include `aria-posinset` to provide information about the element's position within the set along with [`aria-setsize`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-setsize) to inform the user how many items are in the full set.

The following example shows a listbox with four element options out of the 118 in the periodic table of chemical elements.

```html
<h2 id="periodic-table">Periodic table of chemical elements</h2>
<ul role="listbox" aria-labelledby="periodic-table">
  <li role="option" aria-setsize="118" aria-posinset="1">Hydrogen</li>
  <li role="option" aria-setsize="118" aria-posinset="3">Lithium</li>
  <li role="option" aria-setsize="118" aria-posinset="11">Sodium</li>
  <li role="option" aria-setsize="118" aria-posinset="19">Potassium</li>
</ul>
```

The value of each `aria-posinset` is an integer greater than or equal to `1`, and less than or equal to the size of the set when that size is known.

> [!NOTE]
> When using `aria-posinset` you must also include value for [`aria-setsize`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-setsize), which is the size of the entire set. If the size of the entire set is unknown, set `aria-setsize="-1"`.

For [`menuitem`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitem_role), [`menuitemcheckbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitemcheckbox_role), or [`menuitemradio`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitemradio_role), set the value of `aria-posinset` with respect to the total number of items in the menu, excluding any separators.

In a [`feed`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/feed_role), each {{HTMLElement('article')}} element has `aria-posinset` set to a value that represents its position in the feed along with the `aria-setsize` set to either the number of articles that have been loaded or the total number in the feed, depending on which value is most helpful to users.

# ARIA: aria-pressed attribute

The `aria-pressed` attribute indicates the current "pressed" state of a toggle button.

## Description

Adding `aria-pressed` to an element with a role of [`button`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/button_role) turns the button into a toggle button. The `aria-pressed` attribute is only relevant for toggle buttons. It represents the button's current "pressed" state.

The value is "tri-state", meaning the value can be set to `true`, `false`, `mixed`, or `undefined` values. In the case of `aria-pressed`, like most tri-state value types, the default value is `undefined`.

Toggle buttons require a full press-and-release cycle to change their value. Pressing and releasing it once changes the value to `true`. If it's pressed and released again, the value changes back to `false`.

A value of `mixed` means that the values of more than one item controlled by the button do not all share the same value.

Do not change the contents of the label on a toggle when the state changes. If a button label says "pause", do not change it to "play" when pressed. In this example, when the pressed state is true, the label remains "Pause" so a screen reader would say something like "Pause toggle button pressed".

```html
<button aria-pressed="false">Pause</button>
```

If you want the label to toggle between "Paused" and "Play", don't use `aria-pressed`.

The first rule of ARIA use is "if you can use a native feature with the semantics and behavior you require already built in, instead of repurposing an element and adding an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible, then do so." If we employ native HTML semantics with {{HTMLElement('button')}}, we can toggle the label instead of toggling the pressed state, removing the need for the `aria-pressed` attribute.

## Values

- `false`
  - : The button supports being pressed but is not currently pressed.
- `mixed`
  - : Indicates a mixed mode value for a tri-state toggle button.
- `true`
  - : The button is pressed.
- `undefined` (default)
  - : The element does not support being pressed.

# ARIA: aria-readonly attribute

The `aria-readonly` attribute indicates that the element is not editable, but is otherwise operable.

## Description

When you want to indicate that an interactive element works but is not editable, set `aria-readonly="true"`. This indicates to the user that an interactive element that would normally be focusable and copyable has been placed in a read-only (not disabled) state.

When `aria-readonly` is set to `true`, it means the user can read but not set the value of the widget. Read-only elements are still relevant to the user, so you should not prevent the user from navigating to the element or its focusable descendants or copying the value.

Examples include:

- Form elements which should not be changed.
- Row and column headers in a spreadsheet.
- The total value in a shopping cart.

If the non-changeable value shouldn't be able to receive focus, use [`aria-disabled`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-disabled) instead.

> [!NOTE]
> When using semantic HTML form controls, if you set the `readonly` attribute, you don't need to include `aria-readonly="true"`.

> [!NOTE]
> The value of `<input type="checkbox">` can not be edited making `readonly` not relevant. However, when creating checkboxes with `role="checkbox"` the `aria-readonly` attribute _is_ supported.

## Values

- `true`
  - : The element is readonly.
- `false` (default)
  - : The element is not readonly.

# ARIA: aria-relevant attribute

Used in ARIA live regions, the global `aria-relevant` attribute indicates what notifications the user agent will trigger when the [accessibility tree](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessibility_tree) within a live region is modified.

## Description

[ARIA live regions](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Guides/Live_regions) are areas of a web page that are updated when user's attention may be elsewhere. When an update is outside of the user's keyboard focus, assistive technologies such as screen readers use a live region area to report updates to the user.

Examples of live regions include news marquees, stock tickers, chat windows, and score boards. These update without user interaction. Some updates are important for the user to know about. They're relevant. Others are not. The `aria-relevant` is used to describe what types of changes have occurred to an [`aria-live`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-live) region, and which are relevant and should be announced.

The value is a space-separated list of change types, including `additions`, `removals`, and `text`, with a shorthand `all` meaning all three.

When `aria-relevant` is not defined, the value is inherited from the nearest ancestor with a defined value. Inherited values are not additive; the value provided on a descendant element completely overrides any inherited value from an ancestor element. When a live region doesn't have an `aria-relevant` attribute set and has no ancestor with it set, it defaults to `additions text`, which means element nodes are added to the accessibility tree within the live region, AND text content or a text alternative is added to any descendant in the accessibility tree of the live region. This is because generally text modifications and node additions are relevant, but node removals are not.

While not a supported value, if the value of `none` makes the most sense, it should not be a live region.

The values of `removals` and `all` should be used sparingly. For example, when a goal happens in the World Cup, the new score (the addition) is important, the old value (the removal) is not. Assistive technologies only need to be informed of content removal when its removal represents an important change, such as when a player is taken out of the game.

## Values

- `additions`
  - : Element nodes are added to the accessibility tree within the live region.
- `all`
  - : Shorthand for `additions removals text`.
- `removals`
  - : Text content, a text alternative, or an element node within the live region is removed from the accessibility tree.
- `text`
  - : Text content or a text alternative is added to any descendant in the accessibility tree of the live region.

# ARIA: aria-required attribute

The `aria-required` attribute indicates that user input is required on the element before a form may be submitted.

## Description

When a semantic HTML {{htmlelement("input")}}, {{htmlelement("select")}}, or {{htmlelement("textarea")}} must have a value, it should have the [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#required) attribute applied to it. The HTML `required` attribute disables submitting the form unless the required form controls have valid values, while ensuring those navigating with the aid of assistive technologies understand which semantic form controls need valid content.

When form controls are created using non-semantic elements, such as a {{HTMLElement('div')}} with a [role](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles) of [`checkbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/checkbox_role), the `aria-required` attribute should be included, with a value of `true`, to indicate to assistive technologies that user input is required on the element for the form to be submittable. The `aria-required` attribute can be used with HTML form elements; it is not limited to elements that have an ARIA role assigned.

Similar to the HTML `required` attribute set on semantic HTML form controls, the `aria-required` attribute explicitly conveys to assistive technologies that the element is required before a form may be submitted. The `required` attribute on a semantic HTML form control will prevent the form control from being submitted if no value is present — providing native error messaging in some browsers if a required value is invalid when the user attempts to submit the form. The `aria-required` attribute, like all ARIA states and properties, has no impact on element functionality. Functionality and behavior must be added in with JavaScript.

> [!NOTE]
> ARIA only modifies the accessibility tree, modifying how assistive technology presents content to users. ARIA does not change anything about an element's function or behavior. When not using semantic HTML elements for their intended purpose and default functionality, you must use JavaScript to manage behavior, focus, and ARIA states.

The CSS {{CSSXRef(':required')}} and {{CSSXRef(':optional')}} pseudoclasses match {{htmlelement("input")}}, {{htmlelement("select")}}, and {{htmlelement("textarea")}} elements based on whether they are required or optional, respectively. When using non-semantic elements as form controls, you don't get this CSS pseudoclass selector benefit. You can, however, use attribute selectors if the attribute is present: `[aria-required="true"]` or `[aria-required="false"]`.

If a form contains both required and optional form elements, the required elements should be indicated visually using a treatment that does not rely solely on color to convey meaning. Typically, descriptive text and/or an icon are used.

> [!NOTE]
> Which elements are required should be apparent to all users. Ensure the visual presentation indicates the form control is required in a consistent, visible manner, remembering that color is not enough to convey information.

## Examples

The attribute should be added to the form-control role. If the user needs to fill in an email address [`textbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/textbox_role), include `aria-required="true"` on the textbox.

```html
<div id="tbLabel">Email Address *</div>
<div
  role="textbox"
  contenteditable
  aria-labelledby="tblabel"
  aria-required="true"
  id="email1"></div>
```

> [!NOTE]
> If the field's label already contains the word "required", it is recommended to leave out the `aria-required` attribute. This avoids that screen readers read out the term "required" twice.

In this example, JavaScript must be used to prevent the containing form from being submitted if the textbox has no content.

This could be written semantically, without the need for JavaScript:

```html
<label for="email1">Email Address (required)</label>
<input type="email" id="email1" required />
```

## Values

- `true`
  - : The element requires a value or must be checked for the form to be submittable.
- `false`
  - : The element is not required.

# ARIA: aria-roledescription attribute

The `aria-roledescription` attribute defines a human-readable, author-localized description for the role of an element.

## Description

Some assistive technologies (<abbr>AT</abbr>), such as screen readers, present the role of an element as part of the user experience. The `aria-roledescription` attribute provides a way to define a different human-readable name to be presented by AT as the role of an element.

> [!NOTE]
> Only use aria-roledescription to clarify the purpose of non-interactive container roles and to provide a more specific description to a widget.

Users depend on the presentation of known role name to understand the purpose of the element and, if it is a widget, how to interact with it. So, only use `aria-roledescription` to clarify the purpose of non-interactive container roles like `group` or `region` and to provide a more specific description to a widget.

The `aria-roledescription` property overrides how ATs localize and express the name of a role. When you override a role name the user understands, you can potentially negatively impact a users' ability to understand and interact with an element.

Avoid using the `aria-roledescription` attribute. When a use case appears special worthy of a unique roledescription, the interactions can often times be broken down into smaller pieces that have relevant roles.

When there are no semantic or ARIA widget roles that correspond to the interaction model of your widget, use `role="application"`, provide an `aria-roledescription` with a human-readable, author-localized customized role name, and use `aria-describedby` to provide user instructions.

ATs may customize and localize the names of ARIA roles. If you are using `aria-roledescription` to change how the role name is presented to the user, remember to handle localization. The value should be translated when a page is localized.

Changing how the role is presented to the user has no impact on the functionality of the element. For example, if an element has a role of [`region`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/region_role) or [`button`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/button_role) when AT provides functions for navigating to the next region or button, if you set the `aria-roledescription` to `continent` and `escape` respectively, the AT will still allow those functions to navigate to regions and buttons.

Again, avoid using `aria-roledescription`. In this example, `escape` has no relevant meaning to the user, but `button` with "escape" as a label does.

When using `aria-roledescription`, also ensure that the element to which it is applied has a valid ARIA [`role`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles) or has implicit role semantics and that the value itself is not empty and contains more than just whitespace characters.

The `aria-roledescription` is required when using `aria-brailleroledescription`. Note that, in general, `aria-brailleroledescription` should only be used in rare cases when a `aria-roledescription` is excessively verbose when rendered in Braille.

## Examples

The following example shows the use of `aria-roledescription` to indicate that a non-interactive container is a "slide" in a web-based presentation application.

```html
<div
  role="article"
  aria-roledescription="slide"
  id="slide"
  aria-labelledby="slideheading">
  <h1 id="slideheading">Quarterly Report</h1>
  <!-- remaining slide contents -->
</div>
```

In the previous examples, a screen reader user may hear "Quarterly Report, slide" rather than the less precise "Quarterly Report, article".

## Values

- `<string>`
  - : A non-empty string, an unconstrained value type, containing more than just white space.

## Associated interfaces

# ARIA: aria-rowcount attribute

The `aria-rowcount` attribute defines the total number of rows in a table, grid, or treegrid.

## Description

Some tables have hundreds, even millions, of rows. Even for tables with fewer rows, loading only a subsection of rows may be a design requirement, improve performance, or improve user experience. When only a subset of rows are loaded, you do need to let all users know that only a subset of the data is being displayed. The `aria-rowcount` attribute is used to define the total number of rows in a table, grid, or treegrid.

Included on the {{HTMLElement('table')}} element or on an element with a role of [`table`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/cell_role), the value is the number of rows in the full table, as an integer. If the total number of rows is not known, include `aria-rowcount="-1"`, which tells the browser to not count the total number of rows.

If all of the rows are loaded and in the DOM, you don't need to include `aria-rowcount` as browsers automatically count the total number of rows. However, if the rows aren't all present in the DOM at any time, this attribute is needed to provide the number of rows when the full table size is known and to tell the browser to not automatically count the rows when the total number of rows is not known.

## Example

The following example shows a grid with 24 rows, of which the first row and rows 7 through 9 are displayed to the user.

```html
<div role="grid" aria-rowcount="24">
  <div role="rowgroup">
    <div role="row" aria-rowindex="1">
      <span role="columnheader">First Name</span>
      <span role="columnheader">Last Name</span>
      <span role="columnheader">Position</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div role="rowgroup">
    <div role="row" aria-rowindex="7">
      <span role="gridcell">Morgan</span>
      <span role="gridcell">Brian</span>
      <span role="gridcell">Midfielder</span>
    </div>
    <div role="row" aria-rowindex="8">
      <span role="gridcell">Abby</span>
      <span role="gridcell">Dahlkemper</span>
      <span role="gridcell">Defender</span>
    </div>
    <div role="row" aria-rowindex="9">
      <span role="gridcell">Ashlyn</span>
      <span role="gridcell">Harris</span>
      <span role="gridcell">Goalkeeper</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Values

- `<integer>`
  - : The number of rows in the full table or `-1` is the table size is not known.

# ARIA: aria-rowindex attribute

The `aria-rowindex` attribute defines an element's position with respect to the total number of rows within a table, grid, or treegrid.

## Description

Some tables have many, many rows. Loading only a subsection of rows may be done as a design requirement, to improve performance, or to improve user experience.

When only a subset of rows are loaded, you do need to let all users know which subsets of rows are being displayed. The `aria-rowindex` attribute is used to define the cell or row's row index or position with respect to the total number of rows within a table, grid, or treegrid.

Included on the {{HTMLElement('tr')}} element or on an element with a role of [`row`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/row_role), or directly on the {{HTMLElement('td')}}, {{HTMLElement('th')}}, or element with role of [`cell`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/cell_role) or [`gridcell`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/gridcell_role), the value is the row's position with respect to the full table.

The value for `aria-rowindex` is an integer greater than or equal to `1`, greater than the `aria-rowindex` value of any previous rows, and less than or equal to the number of rows in the full table.

If all of the rows are loaded and in the DOM, you don't need to include `aria-rowindex` as browsers automatically calculate the index of each row. However, when only a subset of the rows are present in the DOM, `aria-rowindex` is needed to indicate each row's position with respect to the full table. If only a subset of rows are loaded, you also need to include [`aria-rowcount`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-rowcount) on the table ancestor, even if you don't know the total rowcount.

If the table with only a subset of rows has a cell that spans more than one row, both the row and cell need to have the `aria-rowindex` set. If a cell spans more than one row－when a cell role includes the `aria-rowspan` attribute or HTML cell has a `rowspan` attribute set to a value greater than 1－include the row's `aria-rowindex` value on the spanning cell in addition to the appropriate row spanning attribute. The value should be the row index of the row where the span starts.

> [!NOTE]
> The `aria-rowindex` must be added to each row, but is optional on the cells, except for cells that span rows: the `aria-rowindex` attribute is required on all spanning cells.

## Examples

The following example shows a grid with 24 rows, of which the first row and rows 7 through 10 are displayed to the user. The last "position" cell spans column 9 and 10.

```html
<div role="grid" aria-rowcount="24">
  <div role="rowgroup">
    <div role="row" aria-rowindex="1">
      <span role="columnheader">First Name</span>
      <span role="columnheader">Last Name</span>
      <span role="columnheader">Position</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div role="rowgroup">
    <div role="row" aria-rowindex="7">
      <span role="gridcell">Morgan</span>
      <span role="gridcell">Brian</span>
      <span role="gridcell">Midfielder</span>
    </div>
    <div role="row" aria-rowindex="8">
      <span role="gridcell">Abby</span>
      <span role="gridcell">Dahlkemper</span>
      <span role="gridcell">Defender</span>
    </div>
    <div role="row" aria-rowindex="9">
      <span role="gridcell">Ashlyn</span>
      <span role="gridcell">Harris</span>
      <span role="gridcell" aria-rowspan="2" aria-rowindex="9">Goalkeeper</span>
    </div>
    <div role="row" aria-rowindex="10">
      <span role="gridcell">Alyssa</span>
      <span role="gridcell">Naeher</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Note both `aria-rowspan` and `aria-rowindex` are present on the Goalkeeper cell, which spans two rows.

## Values

- `<integer>`
  - : An integer greater than or equal to 1, greater than the `aria-rowindex` of the previous row, if any, and less than or equal to the value of [`aria-rowcount`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-rowcount).

# ARIA: aria-rowindextext attribute

The `aria-rowindextext` attribute defines a human-readable text alternative of `aria-rowindex`.

## Description

When you have a very long table or when you purposefully want to display just a section of a table, not all rows may be present in the DOM. When this happens, we use the [`aria-rowcount`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-rowcount) with an integer value to define how many rows the table (or grid) would have if all the rows were present and add the [`aria-rowindex`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-rowindex) property on each row and spanning cell to provide information on the row index within that larger table. When the value of `aria-rowindex` is not meaningful or does not reflect the displayed index, we can also add the `aria-rowindextext` to provide a human-readable text alternative to the `aria-rowindex` integer value.

The `aria-rowindextext` should only be included **in addition to**, not as a replacement of, the `aria-rowindex`. Some assistive technologies use the numeric row index for the purpose of keeping track of the user's position or providing alternative table navigation. The `aria-rowindextext` is useful if that integer value isn't meaningful or does not reflect the displayed index, such as a game of Chess or Battleship.

The `aria-rowindextext` is added to each {{HTMLElement('tr')}} or to elements with the `row` role. It can also be addition to cells or owned elements of each row.

## Values

- `<string>`
  - The human-readable text alternative of the numeric [`aria-rowindex`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-rowindex)

# ARIA: aria-rowspan attribute

The `aria-rowspan` attribute defines the number of rows spanned by a cell or gridcell within a table, grid, or treegrid.

## Description

Similar to the `rowspan` attribute of the {{HTMLElement('td')}} and {{HTMLElement('th')}} elements, but for cells and gridcells which are not contained in a native table, the `aria-rowspan` attribute defines the number of rows spanned by a `cell` or `gridcell` within a `table`, `grid`, or `treegrid`.

This attribute is intended for cells and gridcells which are **not** part of an HTML {{HTMLElement('table')}}. When a cell is nested in a semantic `<table>`, the `rowspan` attribute should be used when a <td> or <th> spans more than one row. If both are present, `rowspan` takes precedence over `aria-rowspan`. But, like all ARIA attributes, `aria-rowspan` only impacts the accessibility tree. It doesn't change your layout.

> [!NOTE]
> ARIA modifies the accessibility tree and how assistive technology presents content to your users. ARIA doesn't change anything about an element's function, behavior, or appearance. When using non-semantic elements, you must use CSS to manage layout and appearance.

The value of `aria-rowspan` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than the value which would cause the cell or gridcell to overlap the next cell or gridcell in the same column. Setting the value to `0` indicates that the cell or gridcell is to span all the remaining rows in the row group. The default value is `1`.

## Values

- `<integer>`
  - : An integer greater than or equal to `0` and less than would cause a cell to overlap the next cell in the same column.

# ARIA: aria-selected attribute

The `aria-selected` attribute indicates the current "selected" state of various widgets.

## Description

The `aria-selected` attribute indicates the current "selected" state for [`gridcell`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/gridcell_role), [`option`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/option_role), [`row`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/row_role) and [`tab`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tab_role) roles.

This attribute is used to indicate which elements within single-selection and multiple-selection composite widgets are selected. If more than one element is selectable at a time, include `aria-multiselectable="true"` on the grid, listbox, tablist, or other owning role, while including `aria-selected` only on the selectable cells, options, and tabs.

For other roles, the currently selected state is set with [`aria-current`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-current), or possibly [`aria-checked`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-checked) or [`aria-pressed`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-pressed), depending on the role.

Widgets that support both `aria-selected` and `aria-current` at the same time have different meanings for each. For example, `aria-current="page"` can be used in a navigation tree to indicate which page is currently displayed, while `aria-selected="true"` indicates which page will be displayed if the user activates the `treeitem`.

### Grid

Setting `aria-selected="false"` on a focusable gridcell indicates the cell is selectable. If the grid allows more than one gridcell to be selected at a time, set `aria-multiselectable="true"` on the element with role [`grid`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/grid_role). Setting `aria-selected` on a column or row header gridcell does not propagate the state to other cells in the column or row.

### Option

Both `aria-selected` and `aria-checked` are valid for [`option`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/option_role). Some user interfaces indicate selection with `aria-selected` in single-select list boxes and with `aria-checked` in multi-select list boxes.

Don't specify both `aria-selected` and `aria-checked` on `option` elements contained by the same `listbox` unless the meaning and purpose of `aria-selected` is different from the meaning and purpose of aria-checked in the user interface, the meaning and purpose of each state apparent, and the UI provides separate methods for controlling each state.

### Row

The `aria-selected` attribute is supported on `row` but not `column`. If a grid supports selection, when a cell or row is selected, the selected element has `aria-selected="true"` set.

If the grid supports column selection and a column is selected, all cells in the column have `aria-selected` set to `true`.

### Tab

In a tablist, `aria-selected` is used on a tab to indicate the currently-displayed [`tabpanel`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tabpanel_role).

The selected [`tab`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tab_role) in a [`tablist`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tablist_role) should have the attribute `aria-selected="true"` set. All inactive tabs in the tablist should have `aria-selected="false"` set. Setting the state only impacts the accessibility tree: make sure to style the active tab in a way that visual indicates it's selected state. The default value for `aria-selected` on a `tab` role is `false`.

If more than one tab is selectable at a time, include `aria-multiselectable` on the `tablist`.

## Examples

In this `tablist` example, the first `tab` is selected:

```html
<div class="tab-interface">
  <div role="tablist" aria-label="Sample Tabs">
    <span
      role="tab"
      aria-selected="true"
      aria-controls="panel-1"
      id="tab-1"
      tabindex="0">
      First Tab
    </span>
    <span
      role="tab"
      aria-selected="false"
      aria-controls="panel-2"
      id="tab-2"
      tabindex="-1">
      Second Tab
    </span>
    <span
      role="tab"
      aria-selected="false"
      aria-controls="panel-3"
      id="tab-3"
      tabindex="-1">
      Third Tab
    </span>
  </div>
  <div id="panel-1" role="tabpanel" tabindex="0" aria-labelledby="tab-1">
    <p>Content for the first panel</p>
  </div>
  <div id="panel-2" role="tabpanel" tabindex="0" aria-labelledby="tab-2" hidden>
    <p>Content for the second panel</p>
  </div>
  <div id="panel-3" role="tabpanel" tabindex="0" aria-labelledby="tab-3" hidden>
    <p>Content for the third panel</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

# ARIA: aria-setsize attribute

The `aria-setsize` attribute defines the number of items in the current set of listitems or treeitems when not all items in the set are present in the DOM.

## Description

Browsers automatically calculate the set size and position for each item in a group of items, like the number of {{HTMLelement('li')}}s in a list, buttons in a same-named group of [radio buttons](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/radio), and {{HTMLelement('option')}}s in a {{HTMLelement('select')}}. Assistive technologies, like screen readers, take advantage of this state management to report set sizes to the user.

When the DOM is not complete, the browser calculation of the number of items in a set can be incorrect. When only a subset of items, such as list items, are loaded into the DOM, the browser calculates the number of items based only on those present. The `aria-setsize` attribute should be used to override the browser's incorrect count. It defines the number of items in the current set of listitems or treeitems had the entire set been loaded.

`aria-setsize` attribute is set on each item, rather than on any containing element. The value is the same for each item: an integer reflecting number of items in the complete set, or `-1` if the set size is unknown. If all the items are present in the DOM, the browser can calculate the set size and the position of each item, making both `aria-setsize` and `aria-posinset` unnecessary.

Elements with the `aria-setsize` generally have the [`aria-posinset`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-posinset) attribute included as well to indicate the position of that item within the set. The `aria-posinset` value is between `1` and the positive value of `aria-setsize`.

For example, in a page's comments section, When comments in are not all in the DOM, such as when comments are paginated, the level, total number of comments, and position of each comment should be set with ARIA. The hierarchical level of comments can be indicated with [`aria-level`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-level). Group positional information is indicated with `aria-posinset` and `aria-setsize`.

When a feed has a static number of articles, `aria-setsize` can be added to each article element with the value being either the total number of articles loaded or the total number in the feed. The value chosen depends on which value is most helpful to users. If the number of articles is extremely large, indefinite, or changes often, `aria-setsize="-1"` can be set to communicate the size of the set is unknown.

In a [`listbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/listbox_role), when the complete set of available options is not present in the DOM due to dynamic loading on scroll, both `aria-setsize` and `aria-posinset` can be set on each [`option`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/option_role).

In a tree view, if the complete set of available nodes is not present in the DOM due to dynamic loading as the user moves focus in or scrolls the tree, each node has `aria-level`, `aria-setsize`, and `aria-posinset` set.

In a menu, `aria-setsize` is set on all [`menuitem`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitem_role), [`menuitemcheckbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitemcheckbox_role), or [`menuitemradio`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitemradio_role) roles, with the value being the total number of items in the menu, excluding any separators.

## Example

The following example shows items 5 through 8 in a set of 16.

```html
<h2 id="label_fruit">Available Fruit</h2>
<ul role="listbox" aria-labelledby="label_fruit">
  <li role="option" aria-setsize="16" aria-posinset="5">apples</li>
  <li role="option" aria-setsize="16" aria-posinset="6">bananas</li>
  <li role="option" aria-setsize="16" aria-posinset="7">cantaloupes</li>
  <li role="option" aria-setsize="16" aria-posinset="8">dates</li>
</ul>
```

To orient the user, assistive technologies would list the bananas above as "item 6 out of 16."

## Values

- `<integer>`
  - : The number of items in the full set or `-1` is the set size is unknown.

# ARIA: aria-sort attribute

The `aria-sort` attribute indicates if items in a table or grid are sorted in ascending or descending order.

## Description

If a grid or table provides sort functionality, the `aria-sort` attribute should be set to either `ascending` or `descending` (or `other`) on the header cell element for the sorted column or row.

The `aria-sort` attribute is only set on the currently sorted column or row. Set `aria-sort="ascending"` to indicate the data cells in the column or row are sorted in ascending order. If the sort order is reversed, toggle the value to `aria-sort="descending"`. When a different column or row becomes sorted, the single `aria-sort` attribute is moved to the header cell for the newly sorted column or row with the appropriate value for the sort order.

The `aria-sort` attribute should only be added to a single table or grid header at a time. The attribute is set to inform assistive technology users which column or row is sorted. It doesn't have any impact on the actual sort order.

## Examples

This table loads with the last name column sorted in ascending order.

```html
<table>
  <caption>
    Steering Committee Members
  </caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        <button>First Name</button>
      </th>
      <th aria-sort="ascending">
        <button>Last Name</button>
      </th>
      <th>
        <button>Company</button>
      </th>
      <th>Email</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    …
  </tbody>
</table>
```

If a user clicks on the _Last Name_ button, [`aria-pressed="true"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-pressed) would be added to the {{HTMLElement('button')}} element and the `aria-sort` value would be toggled to `"descending"` with JavaScript. If the user clicks on a different header button, the `aria-sort` would be removed from the _Last Name_ header to be placed on the clicked button's {{HTMLElement('th')}} parent.

We provided instructions in the caption for assistive technology who may not see the down arrows that we would add with CSS targeting the `th[aria-sort="ascending"]` and `th[aria-sort="descending"]` selectors.

## Values

- `ascending`
  - : Items are sorted in ascending order by this column.
- `descending`
  - : Items are sorted in descending order by this column.
- `none` (default)
  - : There is no defined sort applied to the column.
- `other`
  - : A sorting algorithm other than ascending or descending has been applied.

## Associated interfaces

# ARIA: aria-valuemax attribute

The `aria-valuemax` attribute defines the maximum allowed value for a range widget.

## Description

The `aria-valuemax` attribute defines the maximum value allowed for range widgets. It is similar to the `max` attribute of {{HTMLElement('progress')}}, {{HTMLElement('meter')}}, and {{HTMLElement('input')}} of type [`range`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/range), [`number`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/number) and all the date-time types.

When creating a range type role, including [`meter`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/meter_role), [`scrollbar`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/scrollbar_role), [`slider`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/slider_role), and [`spinbutton`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/spinbutton_role) on a non-semantic element, the `aria-valuemax` enables defining a maximum that is more than the minimum value and is a required attribute of `slider`, `scrollbar` and `spinbutton`.

Declaring the minimum and maximum values allows assistive technologies to convey the size of the range to users. The minimum value is defined with [`aria-valuemin`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-valuemin).

> [!WARNING]
> The [`range`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/range_role) role itself should **NOT** be used as it is an ["abstract"](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles#6._abstract_roles). The `aria-valuemax` attribute is used on all of the range roles subtypes.

## Example

The code below shows a slider with a maximum value of 9.

```html
<div id="dimesLabel">Dimes</div>
<div
  role="slider"
  aria-valuenow="0"
  aria-valuemin="0"
  aria-valuemax="9"
  aria-labelledby="dimesLabel"
  id="dimes"></div>
```

## Values

- `<number>`
  - : An integer or decimal number that is greater than the minimum value.

## Associated interfaces

- {{domxref("Element.ariaValueMax")}}
  - : The [`ariaValueMax`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/ariaValueMax) property, part of the {{domxref("Element")}} interface, reflects the value of the `aria-valuemax` attribute.

# ARIA: aria-valuemin attribute

The `aria-valuemin` attribute defines the minimum allowed value for a range widget.

## Description

The `aria-valuemin` attribute defines the minimum value allowed for range widgets. It is similar to the `min` attribute of {{HTMLElement('progress')}}, {{HTMLElement('meter')}}, and {{HTMLElement('input')}} of type [`range`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/range), [`number`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/number) and all the date-time types.

Declaring the minimum and maximum values allows assistive technologies to convey the size of the range to users.

The maximum value is defined with [`aria-valuemax`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-valuemax).

# ARIA: aria-valuenow attribute

The `aria-valuenow` attribute defines the current value for a `range` widget.

## Description

The `aria-valuenow` attribute defines the current value for range widgets. It is similar to the `value` attribute of {{HTMLElement('progress')}}, {{HTMLElement('meter')}}, and {{HTMLElement('input')}} of type [`range`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/range), [`number`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/number) and all the date-time types.

When creating a range type role, including [`meter`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/meter_role), [`scrollbar`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/scrollbar_role), [`slider`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/slider_role), and [`spinbutton`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/spinbutton_role) on a non-semantic element, the `aria-valuenow` enables defining a current numeric value between the minimum and maximum values. The minimum and maximum values are defined with [`aria-valuemin`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-valuemin) and [`aria-valuemax`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-valuemax).

> [!WARNING]
> The [`range`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/range_role) role itself should **NOT** be used as it is an ["abstract"](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles#6._abstract_roles). The `aria-valuenow` attribute is used on all of the range roles subtypes.

```html
<p id="birthyearLabel">What year were you born?</p>
<div
  role="spinbutton"
  tabindex="-1"
  aria-valuenow="1984"
  aria-valuemin="1900"
  aria-valuemax="2021"
  aria-labelledby="birthyearLabel">
  <span class="value"> 1984 </span>
  <span role="button">
    <span aria-hidden="true">+</span>
    Increment year by 1
  </span>
  <span role="button">
    <span aria-hidden="true">-</span>
    Decrement year by 1
  </span>
</div>
```

Use semantic HTML elements when you can:

```html
<label for="birthyear">What year were you born?</label>
<input type="number" id="birthyear" value="1984" min="1900" max="2021" />
```

If there is no known value, like when a progress bar is in an indeterminate state, don't set an `aria-valuenow` attribute.

When there is no `aria-valuenow` set, no information is implied about a current value.

When used with sliders and spinbuttons, assistive technologies announce the actual value to users.

When used with progressbar and scrollbar, assistive technologies announce the value to users as a percent. When `aria-valuemin` and `aria-valuemax` are both defined, the percent value is calculated as a position on the range. Otherwise, the actual value is announced as a percent.

When the value to be announced, either the actual value or the value as a percent, may not be clear to users, the [`aria-valuetext`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-valuetext) attribute should be used to provide a user-friendly representation of the value. When set, the valuetext string is announced instead of the valuenow numeric value. For example, if a slider represents the days of the week, so the day of the week's `aria-valuenow` is a number, the `aria-valuetext` property should be set to a string that makes the slider value understandable, such as "Monday".

## Examples

```html
<p id="temperatureLabel">Oven Temperature</p>
<div
  role="meter"
  id="temperature"
  aria-valuenow="205"
  aria-valuemin="70"
  aria-valuemax="250"
  aria-labelledby="temperatureLabel">
  <div class="meter-color" aria-hidden="true"></div>
</div>
```

The first rule of ARIA use is "if you can use a native feature with the semantics and behavior you require already built in, instead of repurposing an element and **adding** an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible, then do so."

```html
<label for="temperature">Oven Temperature</label>
<input type="range" id="temperature" value="205" min="70" max="250" step="5" />
```

If we employ native HTML semantics with {{HTMLElement('input')}} we get styles and semantics for free.

## Values

- `<number>`
  - : A decimal number, between the minimum and maximum values.

## Associated interfaces

- {{domxref("Element.ariaValueNow")}}
  - : The [`ariaValueNow`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/ariaValueNow) property, part of the {{domxref("Element")}} interface, reflects the value of the `aria-valuenow` attribute.

# ARIA: aria-valuetext attribute

The `aria-valuetext` attribute defines the human-readable text alternative of `aria-valuenow` for a range widget.

## Description

Numbers — even percentages — aren't always user-friendly. Assistive technologies present [`aria-valuenow`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-valuenow) as numeric values. If a progress bar is at 8%, what does that mean? `aria-valuetext` provides a way of presenting the current value in a more user-friendly, human-understandable way. For example, a battery meter value might be conveyed as `aria-valuetext="8% (34 minutes) remaining"`.

The `aria-valuetext` attribute is used with the `aria-valuenow` attribute, not instead of it, unless that value is not known.

`aria-valuetext` is only needed when the numeric value of `aria-valuenow` is not meaningful. For example, a range's values are numeric but may be used for non-numeric values, such as college class level. The values of `aria-valuenow` for a 4-year college could range from 1 through 4, which indicate the position of each value in the value space. In this case, the `aria-valuetext` could be one of the strings: "first year", "sophomore", "junior", and "senior".

If the numeric value is meaningful, such as a spinner with `aria-valuenow="3"` for how many pizza slices you want to order, `aria-valuetext` is not needed.

When both the `aria-valuetext` and `aria-valuenow` are included, the `aria-valuetext` is announced. When there is no `aria-valuetext` attribute, assistive technologies will announce the `aria-valuenow` attribute for the current value.

## Values

- `<string>`
  - : A human-readable text alternative of the `aria-valuenow` value.

## Associated interfaces

- {{domxref("Element.ariaValueText")}}
  - : The [`ariaValueText`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/ariaValueText) property, part of the {{domxref("Element")}} interface, reflects the value of the `aria-valuetext` attribute.

# ARIA states and properties (attributes)

This page lists reference pages covering all the <abbr>WAI-ARIA</abbr> attributes discussed on MDN.

<abbr>ARIA</abbr> attributes enable modifying an element's states and properties as defined in the accessibility tree.

> [!NOTE]
> ARIA only modifies the accessibility tree, modifying how assistive technology presents the content to your users. ARIA doesn't change anything about an element's function or behavior. When not using semantic HTML elements for their intended purpose and default functionality, you must use JavaScript to manage behavior, focus, and ARIA states.

## Global ARIA attributes

Some states and properties apply to all HTML elements regardless of whether an ARIA role is applied. These are defined as "Global" attributes. Global states and properties are supported by all roles and base markup elements.

Many of the above attributes are global, meaning they can be included on any element unless specifically disallowed:

- [`aria-atomic`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-atomic)
- [`aria-busy`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-busy)
- [`aria-controls`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-controls)
- [`aria-current`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-current)
- [`aria-describedby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-describedby)
- [`aria-description`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-description)
- [`aria-details`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-details)
- [`aria-disabled`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-disabled)
- [`aria-dropeffect`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-dropeffect)
- [`aria-errormessage`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-errormessage)
- [`aria-flowto`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-flowto)
- [`aria-grabbed`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-grabbed)
- [`aria-haspopup`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-haspopup)
- [`aria-hidden`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-hidden)
- [`aria-invalid`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-invalid)
- [`aria-keyshortcuts`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-keyshortcuts)
- [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label)
- [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby)
- [`aria-live`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-live)
- [`aria-owns`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-owns)
- [`aria-relevant`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-relevant)
- [`aria-roledescription`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-roledescription)

By "specifically disallowed," all the above attributes are global except for the `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` properties, which are not allowed on elements with role [`presentation`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/presentation_role) nor its synonym [`none`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/none_role) role.

# ARIA: alert role

The `alert` role is for important, and usually time-sensitive, information. The `alert` is a type of [`status`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/status_role) processed as an atomic live region.

## Description

The `alert` role is used to communicate an important and usually time-sensitive message to the user. When this role is added to an element, the browser will send out an accessible alert event to assistive technology products which can then notify the user.

The alert role should only be used for information that requires the user's immediate attention, for example:

- An invalid value was entered into a form field
- The user's login session is about to expire
- The connection to the server was lost so local changes will not be saved

The `alert` role should only be used for text content, not interactive elements such as links or buttons. The element with the `alert` role does not have to be able to receive focus, as screen readers (speech or braille) will automatically announce the updated content regardless of where keyboard focus when the role is added.

The `alert` role is added to the node containing an alert message, **not** the element causing the alert to be triggered. Alerts are [assertive live regions](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Guides/Live_regions). Setting `role="alert"` is equivalent to setting [`aria-live="assertive"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-live) and [`aria-atomic="true"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-atomic). As they don't receive focus, focus does not need to be managed and no user interaction should be required.

> [!WARNING]
> Because of its intrusive nature, the `alert` role must be used sparingly and only in situations where the user's immediate attention is required.

The [`alert`](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#alert) role is of the five [live region](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Guides/Live_regions) roles. Dynamic changes that are less urgent should use a less aggressive method, such as including `aria-live="polite"` or using an other live region role like [`status`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/status_role). If the user is expected to close the alert, then the [`alertdialog`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/alertdialog_role) role should be used instead.

The most important thing to know about the `alert` role is that it's for content that is dynamically displayed, not for content that appears on page load. It is perfect for situations such as when a user fills out a form and JavaScript is used to add an error message - the alert would immediately read out the message. It should not be used on HTML that the user hasn't interacted with. For example, if a page loads with multiple visible alerts scattered throughout, the alert role should not be used, as the messages were not dynamically triggered.

As with all other [live regions](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Guides/Live_regions), alerts will only be announced when the content of the element with `role="alert"` is _updated_. Make sure that the element with the role is present in the page's markup first - this will "prime" the browser and screen reader to keep watching the element for changes. After this, any changes to the content will be announced. Do not try to dynamically add/generate an element with `role="alert"` that is already populated with the alert message you want announced - this generally does _not_ lead to an announcement, as it is not a content change.

As the `alert` role reads out any content that has changed, it should be used with caution. Alerts, by definition, are disruptive. Several alerts at once, and unnecessary alerts, create bad user experiences.

## Examples

The following are common examples of alerts and how to implement them:

### Example 1: Making ready-made content inside an element with an alert role visible

If the content _inside_ the element with `role="alert"` is initially hidden using CSS, making it visible will cause the alert to fire. This means that an existing alert container element can be "reused" multiple times.

```css
.hidden {
  display: none;
}
```

```html
<div id="expirationWarning" role="alert">
  <span class="hidden">Your log in session will expire in 2 minutes</span>
</div>
```

```js
// removing the 'hidden' class makes the content inside the element visible, which will make the screen reader announce the alert:
document
  .getElementById("expirationWarning")
  .firstChild.classList.remove("hidden");
```

### Example 2: Dynamically changing the content inside an element with an alert role

Using JavaScript, you can dynamically change the content _inside_ the element with `role="alert"`. Note that if you need to fire the same alert multiple times (i.e., the content you're dynamically inserting is the same as before), this generally won't be seen as a change and will _not_ lead to an announcement. For this reason, it's usually best to briefly "clear" the contents of the alert container before then injecting the alert message.

```html
<div id="alertContainer" role="alert"></div>
```

```js
// clear the contents of the container
document.getElementById("alertContainer").textContent = "";
// inject the new alert message
document.getElementById("alertContainer").textContent =
  `Your session will expire in ${expiration} minutes`;
```

### Example 3: Visually hidden alert container for screen reader notifications

It's possible to visually hide the alert container itself, and use it to provide updates/notifications explicitly for screen readers. This can be useful in situations where important content on the page has been updated, but where the change would not be immediately obvious to a screen-reader user.

However, make sure that the container is not hidden using `display:none`, as this will hide it even from assistive technologies, meaning that they won't be notified of any changes. Instead, use something like the [`.visually-hidden` styles](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/how-to-hide-content/).

```html
<div id="hiddenAlertContainer" role="alert" class="visually-hidden"></div>
```

```css
.visually-hidden {
  clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
  clip-path: inset(50%);
  height: 1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  position: absolute;
  white-space: nowrap;
  width: 1px;
}
```

```js
// clear the contents of the container
document.getElementById("hiddenAlertContainer").textContent = "";
// inject the new alert message
document.getElementById("hiddenAlertContainer").textContent =
  "All items were removed from your inventory.";
```

# ARIA: alertdialog role

The **alertdialog** role is to be used on modal alert dialogs that interrupt a user's workflow to communicate an important message and require a response.

## Description

The `alertdialog` role is used to notify users of urgent information that demands the user's immediate attention. Including `role="alertdialog"` on the element containing the dialog helps assistive technology identify the content as being grouped and separated from the rest of the page content. Examples include error messages that require confirmation and other action confirmation prompts.

As the name implies, `alertdialog` is a mashup of the [`dialog`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/dialog_role) and [`alert`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/alert_role) roles. `alertdialog` is a type of `dialog` with similar use cases as `alert`, but for when a user response is required.

> [!NOTE]
> The `alertdialog` role should only be used for alert messages that have associated interactive controls. If an alert dialog only contains static content and has no interactive controls at all, use [`alert`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/alert_role) instead.

Being a type of dialog, the [`dialog`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/dialog_role) role's states, properties, and keyboard focus requirements are applicable to the `alertdialog` role as well.

Because of its urgent nature, interrupting the user's workflow, alert dialogs should be [modal](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-modal).

The alert dialog must have at least one focusable control — such as Confirm, Close, and Cancel — and focus must be moved to that control when the alert dialog appears. Alert dialogs can have additional interactive controls such as text fields and checkboxes.

The `alertdialog` role is not to be used as a replacement for other dialogs, including no-confirmation-required `alert` dialogs ([`Window.alert()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert)) and prompts ([`Window.prompt()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt)).

Adding `role="alertdialog"` alone is not sufficient to make an alert dialog accessible. The following also need to be done:

- The alert dialog must be properly labeled
- Keyboard focus must be managed correctly

The `alertdialog` must have an accessible name, defined with [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) or [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label). The alert dialog text must have an {{glossary("accessible description")}} using [`aria-describedby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-describedby).

### Associated WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties

- [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby)
  - : Use this attribute to label the alertdialog. The `aria-labelledby` attribute is generally the id of the element used to title the alertdialog.

- [`aria-describedby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-describedby)
  - : Use this attribute to encompass the description of the contents of the alert dialog. The value of the `aria-describedby` attribute is generally the ID of the element containing the alert dialog's messaging, usually coming right after the title.

## Examples

### Example 1: A basic alert dialog

```html
<div
  role="alertdialog"
  aria-labelledby="dialog1Title"
  aria-describedby="dialog1Desc">
  <div role="document" tabindex="0">
    <h2 id="dialog1Title">Your login session is about to expire</h2>
    <p id="dialog1Desc">To extend your session, click the OK button</p>
    <button>OK</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

The code snippet above shows how to mark up an alert dialog that only provides a message and an OK button.

### Example 2: Confirmation dialog with two options

```html
<div
  id="alert_dialog"
  role="alertdialog"
  aria-modal="true"
  aria-labelledby="dialog_label"
  aria-describedby="dialog_desc">
  <h2 id="dialog_label">Confirmation</h2>
  <div id="dialog_desc">
    <p>Are you sure you want to delete this image?</p>
    <p>This change can't be undone.</p>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <button id="close-btn" type="button">No</button>
    </li>
    <li>
      <button id="confirm-btn" type="button" aria-controls="form">Yes</button>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

```js
document.getElementById("close-btn").addEventListener("click", () => {
  closeDialog();
});
document.getElementById("confirm-btn").addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  deleteFile();
});
```

# ARIA: application role

The `application` role indicates to assistive technologies that an element _and all of its children_ should be treated similar to a desktop application, and no traditional HTML interpretation techniques should be used. This role should only be used to define very dynamic and desktop-like web applications. Most mobile and desktop web apps _are not_ considered applications for this purpose.

```html
<div role="application" aria-label="…">…</div>
```

By specifying the `application` role, it indicates this `div` element and all of its descendants are to be treated like they are part of a desktop application.

## Description

The `application` [document structure role](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles#1._document_structure_roles), indicates to assistive technologies that this part of the web content contains elements that do not conform to any other known HTML element or WAI-ARIA widget. Any sort of special interpretation of HTML structures and widgets should be suspended, and control should be completely handed over to the browser and web application to handle mouse, keyboard, or touch interaction.

In this mode, the web author is completely responsible for handling any and all keyboard input, focus management, and other interactions and cannot assume assistive technologies would do any processing on their end.

If the web application encompassed by the application role contains parts that _should_ be treated like normal web content, a role of [`document`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/document_role) or [`article`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/article_role) should be used to contain such content.

### Background

For historic reasons, especially on Windows, screen readers and some other assistive technologies (AT) have traditionally grabbed the whole web content from the browser at once after it had finished loading. The ATs build their own representation of it that makes the most sense for a visually impaired user to consume the content. This is often referred to as _virtual document_, _browse mode_, or similar terms. The document is streamlined to a single-column view. A keyboard interaction model is generated that is very similar to a word processor where users can read line by line, sentence by sentence, or paragraph by paragraph. The AT will read any semantics like links, headings, form controls, tables, lists, or images.

In addition, a set of so-called _quick navigation keys_ has been established over the years that allows visually impaired users to skim through a page via a certain element type. Such elements usually include headings, form fields, lists, tables, links, graphics, or landmark regions.

For all of this to work, ATs intercept almost all keyboard input and consume it themselves, letting nothing through to the browser or other user agent. To be able to interact with a web page, a standard set of widgets is recognized that, when pressing a certain key (usually the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key) this mode is switched off. The screen reader mode, often called _forms mode_ or _focus mode_, lets all keyboard input go through to the browser again. <kbd>Escape</kbd> is the most common way of switching back to _browse_ mode, but when within a specific `application` section, some screen readers may require other keys to purposefully exit this mode. For instance <kbd>NUMPAD PLUS</kbd> with JAWS.

The `application` role is designed to provide a means for widgets that are not part of the standard set to be accessible for direct interaction in ATs that use both _browse_ and _focus_ modes for interacting with web content. Most common widgets have expected keyboard interaction behaviors. Because of this, a custom keyboard experience created by a web author would create a confusing experience.

### Associated WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties

- [`document`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/document_role), [`article`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/article_role)
  - : Used to indicate parts of the application that should be treated as normal web content
- [`aria-activedescendant`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-activedescendant)
  - : Used to manage focus inside the application.
- [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label)
  - : Used to provide the name of the application or purpose of the widget that is being exposed.

- [`aria-haspopup`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-haspopup)
  - : Indicates there is a popup, such as menu or dialog, that can be triggered by the element.

### Keyboard interactions

Keyboard interaction is completely under the web author's control and can be anything associated with the particular widget being implemented. In a slides application, for example, a widget could be created that uses the arrow keys to position elements on the slide, and uses audio feedback via an ARIA live region to communicate the position and overlap status with other objects. Focus is being managed via _aria-activedescendant_.

The <kbd>Tab</kbd>, <kbd>Space</kbd> and <kbd>Enter</kbd> keys, as well as <kbd>Escape</kbd>, must be handled by the application. The one exception is if focus is set to a standard widget inside the application that supports keyboard navigation from the browser, for example an [input](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input) element.

### Required JavaScript features

- keyPress
  - : Used to handle keyboard input and control the focus
- Click, Touch
  - : Handle as appropriate for your widget as well
- Changing attribute values
  - : [`aria-activedescendant`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-activedescendant) is used to manage the focus inside the application container. Set in response to keyboard or other application events that change focus or point of interaction.

> [!NOTE]
> The `application` role does not have a related HTML widget and thus is completely free form. The author of the application must take full responsibility for not letting users get stuck in a focus trap inside something the user cannot exit from. All aspects of interaction, including returning to the regular web content on other parts of the page, must be handled. Use wisely, and cautiously, and remember to test!

## Examples

Some prominent web applications that use or have used the application role properly are:

- Google Docs, Sheets and Slides
- CKEditor and TinyMCE WYSIWYG web editors, like the one used on the Mozilla Developer Network
- Some parts of Gmail

## Accessibility concerns

Improperly using the `application` role can unintentionally take away access from information on a web page, so be very mindful of using it. Think hard on if you actually need it and cannot just use a set of other known widgets to accomplish the same task.

If used, the application role should be added to the lowest common container possible, not on the `<body>` element, for example. Also be sure to test what you have written with assistive technology, to verify it works as intended.

## Specifications

## Precedence order

Applying the `application` role will cause this and all of the descendant elements of this element to be treated like application content, not web content. Any reading mechanisms assistive technologies may have for web content will not apply.

# ARIA: article role

The `article` role indicates a section of a page that could easily stand on its own on a page, in a document, or on a website. It is usually set on related content items such as comments, forum posts, newspaper articles or other items grouped together on one page.

```html
<div role="article">
  <h2>Heading of the segment</h2>
  <p>Paragraph for the segment.</p>
  <p>Another paragraph.</p>
  Controls to interact with the article, share it, etc.
</div>
<div role="article">…</div>
```

This example shows two articles side by side on one page that could be structured similarly and are related.

> [!NOTE]
> Instead of a `<div>` with an `article` role, use the {{HTMLElement('article')}} element. **Always use native element if available**

Don't use `role="article"`. Instead use the `<article>` element.

```html
<article>
  <h2>Heading of the segment</h2>
  <p>Paragraph for the segment.</p>
  <p>Another paragraph.</p>
  Controls to interact with the article, share it, etc.
</article>
<article>…</article>
```

## Description

The `article` [document structure role](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles#1._document_structure_roles) denotes a section of a document, page, or site that, if it were standing on its own, could be viewed as a complete document, page or site. The aim of a set of article sections is to indicate their relationship to one another.

Articles are not considered a navigational landmark, but many assistive technologies that support landmarks also support a means to navigate among articles. They may also support indication of nesting relationships within articles.

Articles can be nested, indicating that a nested article directly relates to the one it is nested in, but not necessarily to the ones outside the nesting hierarchy. Reference the examples for specific use cases.

If an article is part of a feed, it can have the [`aria-posinset`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-posinset) and [`aria-setsize`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-setsize) attributes set to indicate which position within the feed this particular article represents.

Inside an `application` or other widget that causes screen readers and other assistive technologies to be in pass-through mode, an article can be used to indicate that these should switch back to treating the enclosed content as regular web content.

Instead of including the `article` role on a non-semantic element, the {{HTMLElement('article')}} element should be used. User agents translate this to the appropriate accessibility information just like the `article` role. Using the {{HTMLElement('article')}} element also helps search engines better discover the structure of a page. Examples of appropriate uses of the `role="article"`, or preferably `<article>`, include blog posts, forum posts, a comment to a forum or blog post, any an item in a social media feed.

### Associated WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties

- [`aria-posinset`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-posinset)
  - : In the context of a feed, indicates the position of this particular article within that feed, based on a count starting at 1.
- [`aria-setsize`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-setsize)
  - : In the context of a feed, indicates how many article items there are within that feed.

### Keyboard interactions

This role does not support any specific keyboard interaction.

### Required JavaScript features

- Event handlers
  - : This role does not require any event handlers to be present.
- Changing attribute values
  - : When constructing a feed, set the `aria-posinset` and `aria-setsize` attributes on each article role to the appropriate values, bearing in mind that `aria-posinset` is 1-based.

> [!NOTE]
> **Always use native element if available.** Instead of a `<div>` with the `article` role, the `<article>` element should be used.

## Examples

- The [restaurant recommendations feed display](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/feed/examples/feed-display.html) along with its separate [documentation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/feed/examples/feed/) from the WAI-ARIA 1.1 authoring practices feed design pattern

## Precedence order

This role corresponds to the {{HTMLElement('article')}} element in HTML, and that element should be used instead, if possible. This role does not require any specific roles to be present among its children. It is the only role allowed as a direct child of an element with the [`feed`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/feed_role) role.

# ARIA: banner role

The `banner` role is for defining a global site header, which usually includes a logo, company name, search feature, and possibly the global navigation or a slogan. It is generally located at the top of the page.

By default, the HTML's {{htmlelement("header")}} element has an identical meaning to the `banner` landmark, unless it is a descendant of {{htmlelement("aside")}}, {{htmlelement("article")}}, {{htmlelement("main")}}, {{htmlelement("nav")}}, or {{htmlelement("section")}}, at which point {{htmlelement("header")}} exposes a [`generic`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/generic_role) role, and not the equivalent of the site-wide banner.

## Description

A `banner` landmark role overwrites the implicit ARIA role of the container element upon which it is applied. It should be reserved for globally repeating site-wide content that is generally located at the top of every page.

The banner typically includes things such as a logo or corporate identity, or possibly a site-specific search tool, and is generally what your marketing team would call the "header" or "top banner" of the site. If the [`header` element](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/header) technique is not being used for that banner, a declaration of `role="banner"` should be used to define a banner landmark to assistive technologies.

Assistive technologies can identify the `header` element of a page as the `banner` if it is a descendant of the [`body` element](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/body), and not nested within an `article`, `aside`, `main`, `nav` or `section` subsection.

Each page may have a `banner` landmark, but each page should generally be limited to a single element with the role of banner. In the case of a page containing nested `document` and/or `application` roles, each nested `document` or `application` role may also have one `banner` landmark. If a page includes more than one `banner` landmark, each should have a unique accessible name.

### Associated ARIA roles, states, and properties

None.

### Keyboard interactions

None.

### Required JavaScript features

None.

## Examples

Here's a fake banner with a skip to navigation link, a logo, a title and a subtitle. As this is the main header for the site, we've added the `banner` landmark role to the container element.

```html
<div role="banner">
  <a href="#main" id="skipToMain" class="skiptocontent">Skip To main content</a>
  <img src="images/w3c.png" alt="W3C Logo" />
  <h1>ARIA Landmarks</h1>
  <p>Identifying page subsections for easy navigation</p>
  <nav>…</nav>
</div>
```

We could also have written the above with the HTML `header` element:

```html
<header>
  <a href="#main" id="skipToMain" class="skiptocontent">Skip To main content</a>
  <img src="images/w3c.png" alt="W3C Logo" />
  <h1>ARIA Landmarks</h1>
  <p>Identifying page subsections for easy navigation</p>
  <nav>…</nav>
</header>
```

## Best practices

Using the {{HTMLElement('header')}} element will automatically communicate that the element has a role of `banner`. If possible, prefer using the semantic `<header>` element instead of the `banner` role.

While it is best to use the `header` element and ensure it is not a descendant of any subsection of the page, sometimes you don't have access to the underlying HTML. If this is the case, you can add the role of `banner` to the element of the page which should be exposed as a `banner` with JavaScript. Identifying the page's banner in this way will help improve the site's accessibility.

# ARIA: button role

The `button` role is for clickable elements that trigger a response when activated by the user. Adding `role="button"` tells the screen reader the element is a button, but provides no button functionality. Use {{HTMLElement("button")}} or {{HTMLElement("input")}} with `type="button"` instead.

## Description

The button role identifies an element as a button to assistive technology such as screen readers. A button is a widget used to perform actions such as submitting a form, opening a dialog, canceling an action, or performing a command such as inserting a new record or displaying information. Adding `role="button"` tells assistive technology that the element is a button but provides no button functionality. Use {{HTMLElement("button")}} or {{HTMLElement("input")}} with `type="button"` instead.

This `button` role can be used in combination with the [`aria-pressed`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-pressed) attribute to [create toggle buttons](#toggle_buttons).

```html
<div id="saveChanges" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-pressed="false">Save</div>
```

The above example creates a focusable button, but requires JavaScript and CSS to include button appearance and functionality. These are features provided by default when using the {{HTMLElement("button")}} and {{HTMLElement("input")}} with `type="button"` elements:

```html
<button type="button" id="saveChanges">Save</button>
```

> [!NOTE]
> If using `role="button"` instead of the semantic `<button>` or `<input type="button">` elements, you will need to make the element focusable and define event handlers for {{domxref("Element/click_event", "click")}} and {{domxref("Element/keydown_event", "keydown")}} events. This includes handling the <kbd>Enter</kbd> and <kbd>Space</kbd> key presses in order to process all forms of user input. See [the official WAI-ARIA example code](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/button/examples/button/).

In addition to the ordinary button widget, `role="button"` should be included when creating a toggle button or menu button using a non-button element.

A toggle button is a two-state button that can be either off (not pressed) or on (pressed). The [`aria-pressed`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-pressed) attribute values of `true` or `false` identify a button as a toggle button.

A menu button is a button that controls a menu and has an [`aria-haspopup`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-haspopup) property attribute set to either `menu` or `true`.

### All descendants are presentational

There are some types of user interface components that, when represented in a platform accessibility API, can only contain text. Accessibility APIs do not have a way of representing semantic elements contained in a `button`. To deal with this limitation, browsers, automatically apply role [`presentation`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/presentation_role) to all descendant elements of any `button` element as it is a role that does not support semantic children.

For example, consider the following `button` element, which contains a heading.

```html
<div role="button"><h3>Title of my button</h3></div>
```

Because descendants of `button` are presentational, the following code is equivalent:

```html
<div role="button"><h3 role="presentation">Title of my button</h3></div>
```

From the assistive technology user's perspective, the heading does not exist since the previous code snippets are equivalent to the following in the [accessibility tree](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessibility_tree):

```html
<div role="button">Title of my button</div>
```

### Associated ARIA roles, states, and properties

- [`aria-pressed`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-pressed)
  - : The `aria-pressed` attribute defines the button as a toggle button. The value describes the state of the button. The values include `aria-pressed="false"` when a button is not currently pressed, `aria-pressed="true"` to indicate a button is currently pressed, and `aria-pressed="mixed"` if the button is considered to be partially pressed. If the attribute is omitted or set to its default value of `aria-pressed="undefined"`, the element does not support being pressed.
- [`aria-expanded`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-expanded)
  - : If the button controls a grouping of other elements, the `aria-expanded` state indicates whether the controlled grouping is currently expanded or collapsed. If the button has `aria-expanded="false"` set, the grouping is not currently expanded; If the button has `aria-expanded="true"` set, it is currently expanded; if the button has `aria-expanded="undefined"` set or the attribute is omitted, it is not expandable.

### Basic buttons

Buttons should always have an accessible name. For most buttons, this name will be the same as the text inside the button, between the opening and closing tags. In some cases, for example buttons represented by icons, the accessible name may be provided from the [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) or [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) attributes.

### Toggle buttons

A toggle button typically has two states: pressed and not pressed. A third mixed state is available for toggle buttons that control other elements, such as other toggle buttons or checkboxes, which do not all share the same value. Whether an element is a toggle button or not can be indicated with the [`aria-pressed`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-pressed) attribute in addition to the `button` role (if the element is not already a native button element):

- If `aria-pressed` is not used, or is set to the "undefined" state, the button is not a toggle button.
- If `aria-pressed="false"` is used the button is a toggle button that is currently not pressed.
- If `aria-pressed="true"` is used the button is a toggle button that is currently pressed.
- if `aria-pressed="mixed"` is used, the button is considered to be partially pressed.

As an example, the mute button on an audio player labeled "mute" could indicate that sound is muted by setting the `aria-pressed` state true. The label of a toggle button should not change when its state changes. In our example the label remains "Mute" with a screen reader reading "Mute toggle button pressed" or "Mute toggle button not pressed" depending on the value of `aria-pressed`. If the design were to call for the button label to change from "Mute" to "Unmute," a toggle button would not be appropriate, so the `aria-pressed` attribute would be omitted.

### Keyboard interactions

| Key              | Function              |
| ---------------- | --------------------- |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Activates the button. |
| <kbd>Space</kbd> | Activates the button  |

Following button activation, focus is set depending on the type of action the button performs. For example, if clicking the button opens a dialog, the focus should move to the dialog. If the button closes a dialog, focus should return to the button that opened the dialog unless the function performed in the dialog context logically leads to a different element. If the button alters the current context, such as muting and unmuting an audio file, then focus typically remains on the button.

### Required JavaScript Features

#### Required event handlers

Buttons can be operated by mouse, touch, and keyboard users. For native HTML `<button>` elements, the button's `onclick` event fires for mouse clicks and when the user presses <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> while the button has focus. But if another tag is used to create a button, the `onclick` event only fires when clicked by the mouse cursor, even if `role="button"` is used. Because of this, separate key event handlers must be added to the element so that the button is be triggered when the <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> key is pressed.

- `onclick`
  - : Handles the event raised when the button is activated using a mouse click or touch event.
- `onKeyDown`
  - : Handles the event raised when the button is activated using the Enter or Space key on the keyboard. (Note not the [deprecated onKeyPress](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/keypress_event))

## Examples

### Basic button example

In this example, a span element has been given the `button` role. Because a `<span>` element is used, the `tabindex` attribute is required to make the button focusable and part of the page's tab order. The included CSS style is provided to make the `<span>` element look like a button, and to provide visual cues when the button has focus.

The `handleBtnClick` and `handleBtnKeyDown` event handlers perform the button's action when activated using a mouse click or the <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> key. In this case, the action is to add a new name to the list of names.

Try the example by adding a name to the text box. The button will cause the name to be added to a list.

#### HTML

```html
<h1>ARIA Button Example</h1>
<ul id="nameList"></ul>
<label for="newName">Enter your Name: </label>
<input type="text" id="newName" />
<span role="button" tabindex="0">Add Name</span>
```

#### CSS

```css
[role="button"] {
  padding: 2px;
  background-color: navy;
  color: white;
  cursor: default;
}
[role="button"]:hover,
[role="button"]:focus,
[role="button"]:active {
  background-color: white;
  color: navy;
}
ul {
  list-style: none;
}
```

#### JavaScript

```js
function handleCommand(event) {
  // Handles both mouse clicks and keyboard
  // activate with Enter or Space

  // Key presses other than Enter and Space should not trigger a command
  if (
    event instanceof KeyboardEvent &&
    event.key !== "Enter" &&
    event.key !== " "
  ) {
    return;
  }

  // Get the new name value from the input element
  const newNameInput = document.getElementById("newName");
  const name = newNameInput.value;
  newNameInput.value = ""; // clear the text field
  newNameInput.focus(); // give the text field focus to enable entering and additional name.

  // Don't add blank entries to the list.
  if (name.length > 0) {
    const listItem = document.createElement("li");
    listItem.appendChild(document.createTextNode(name));

    // Add the new name to the list.
    const list = document.getElementById("nameList");
    list.appendChild(listItem);
  }
}

const btn = document.querySelector("span[role='button']");
btn.addEventListener("click", handleCommand);
btn.addEventListener("keydown", handleCommand);
```

### Toggle button example

In this snippet a {{HTMLElement("span")}} element is converted to a toggle button using the `button` role and the `aria-pressed` attribute. When the button is activated, the `aria-pressed` value switches states; changing from `true` to `false` and back again.

#### HTML

```html
<button type="button">Mute Audio</button>

<span role="button" tabindex="0" aria-pressed="false"> Mute Audio </span>

<audio
  id="audio"
  src="https://soundbible.com/mp3/Tyrannosaurus%20Rex%20Roar-SoundBible.com-807702404.mp3">
  Your browser does not support the `audio` element.
</audio>
```

#### CSS

```css
button,
[role="button"] {
  padding: 3px;
  border: 2px solid transparent;
}

button:active,
button:focus,
[role="button"][aria-pressed="true"] {
  border: 2px solid black;
}
```

#### JavaScript

```js
function handleBtnClick(event) {
  toggleButton(event.target);
}

function handleBtnKeyDown(event) {
  // Check to see if space or enter were pressed
  // "Spacebar" for IE11 support
  if (event.key === " " || event.key === "Enter" || event.key === "Spacebar") {
    // Prevent the default action to stop scrolling when space is pressed
    event.preventDefault();
    toggleButton(event.target);
  }
}

function toggleButton(element) {
  const audio = document.getElementById("audio");

  // Check to see if the button is pressed
  const pressed = element.getAttribute("aria-pressed") === "true";

  // Change aria-pressed to the opposite state
  element.setAttribute("aria-pressed", !pressed);

  // Toggle the play state of the audio file
  if (pressed) {
    audio.pause();
  } else {
    audio.play();
  }
}

const button = document.querySelector("button");
const spanButton = document.querySelector("span[role='button']");
button.addEventListener("click", handleBtnClick);
button.addEventListener("keydown", handleBtnKeyDown);
spanButton.addEventListener("click", handleBtnClick);
spanButton.addEventListener("keydown", handleBtnKeyDown);
```

## Accessibility concerns

Buttons are interactive controls and thus focusable. If the `button` role is added to an element that is not focusable by itself (such as `<span>`, `<div>` or `<p>`) then, the `tabindex` attribute has to be used to make the button focusable.

> [!WARNING]
> Be careful when marking up links with the button role. Buttons are expected to be triggered using the <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> key, while links are expected to be triggered using the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key. In other words, when links are used to behave like buttons, adding `role="button"` alone is not sufficient. It will also be necessary to add a key event handler that listens for the <kbd>Space</kbd> key in order to be consistent with native buttons.

When the `button` role is used, screen readers announce the element as a button, generally saying "click" followed by the button's accessible name. The accessible name is either the content of the element or the value of an `aria-label` or element referenced by an `aria-labelledby` attribute, or description, if included.

## Best practices

If a link performs the action of a button, giving the element `role="button"` helps assistive technology users understand the function of the element. However, a better solution is to adjust the visual design so it matches the function and ARIA role. Where possible, it is recommended to use native HTML buttons (`<button>`, `<input type="button">`, `<input type="submit">`, `<input type="reset">` and `<input type="image">`) rather than the `button` role, as native HTML buttons are supported by all user agents and assistive technology and provide keyboard and focus requirements by default, without need for additional customization.

# ARIA: cell role

The `cell` value of the ARIA _role_ attribute identifies an element as being a cell in a tabular container that does not contain column or row header information. To be supported, the cell must be nested in an element with the role of `row`.

```html
<div role="row">
  <span role="cell">France</span>
  <span role="cell">67 million</span>
</div>
```

A better, more semantic way of writing the cells above would be to use the semantic [`<td>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/td) element.

```html
<tr role="row">
  <td role="cell">France</td>
  <td role="cell">67 million</td>
</tr>
```

## Description

The element with `role="cell"` is a cell within a row, optionally within a [`rowgroup`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/rowgroup_role), within a [`table`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/table_role). If the cell is in a [`grid`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/grid_role) or [`treegrid`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/treegrid_role), opt for [`gridcell`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/gridcell_role). Using native HTML {{HTMLElement('td')}} elements, whenever possible, is strongly encouraged.

Each element with `role="cell"` MUST be nested in a container element with [`role="row"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/row_role). That row, in turn, can be nested within an element with [`role="rowgroup"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/rowgroup_role), and should be nested within a `grid`, `table` or `treegrid`. If a cell contains column or row header information, use the `columnheader` or `rowheader` roles, respectively. If the cell does not contain header information and is nested in a `grid` or `treegrid`, the role of `gridcell` may be more appropriate.

A cell can contain a number of property attributes clarifying the cell's position within the tabular data structure, including [`aria-colindex`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-colindex), [`aria-colspan`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-colspan), [`aria-rowindex`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-rowindex), and [`aria-rowspan`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-rowspan).

> [!NOTE]
> Using the native HTML table element ({{HTMLElement('table')}}) element, along with the table row element ({{HTMLElement('tr')}}), and table cell element ({{HTMLElement('td')}}), whenever possible, is strongly encouraged.

### Associated WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties

#### Context roles

- [role="row"](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/row_role)
  - : An element with `role="row"` is a row of cells within a tabular structure. A row contains one or more cells, grid cells, column headers, or row headers within a [`grid`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/grid_role), [`table`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/table_role) or `treegrid`, and optionally within a [`rowgroup`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/rowgroup_role).
- [role="rowgroup"](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/rowgroup_role)
  - : `Row` is a required cell parent. `Rowgroup` is an optional contextual row parent. It establishes a relationship between descendant rows. It is a structural equivalent to the [`thead`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/thead), [`tfoot`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/tfoot), and [`tbody`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/tbody) elements in an [HTML `table`](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/HTML_table_basics) element.
- [role="table"](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/table_role)
  - : One of the three possible contexts (along with `grid` and `treegrid`) in which you'll find a row containing cells. Table identifies the cell as being part of a non-interactive table structure containing data arranged in rows and columns, similar to the native HTML [`<table>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/table) element.
- [role="grid"](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/grid_role)
  - : One of the three possible contexts (along with `table` and `treegrid`) in which you'll find a row containing `cells` and `gridcells`. `Grid` identifies a cell as being part of a possibly interactive table structure containing data arranged in rows and columns, similar to the native [`<table>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/table) HTML element.
- [role="treegrid"](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/treegrid_role)
  - : Similar to a grid, but with rows that can be expanded and collapsed in the same manner as for a tree.

#### Subclass roles

- [role="gridcell"](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/gridcell_role)
  - : A cell in a row within a `grid` or `treegrid`.
- [role="columnheader"](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/columnheader_role)
  - : A header cell that is the structural equivalent of the HTML [`<th>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/th) element with a column scope. Unlike a plain cell, the `columnheader` role establishes a relationship between it and all cells in the corresponding column.
- [role="rowheader"](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/rowheader_role)
  - : A header cell that is the structural equivalent of the HTML [`<th>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/th) element with a row scope. Unlike a plain cell, the `rowheader` role establishes a relationship between it and all cells in the corresponding row.

#### States and properties

- [`aria-colspan`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-colspan)
  - : Similar to the HTML [`<th>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/th) and [`<td>` colspan attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/td), it defines the number of columns spanned by the cell.
- [`aria-rowspan`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-rowspan)
  - : Similar to the HTML [`<th>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/th) and [`<td>` rowspan attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/td), it defines the number of rows spanned by the cell.
- [`aria-colindex`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-colindex) attribute
  - : The `aria-colindex` attribute is only needed if columns are hidden from the DOM. The attribute takes as its value an integer between 1 and the total number of columns within the `table`, `grid` or `treegrid`. The `aria-colindex` defines an element's column index or position with respect to the total number of columns within a row. If all the columns are in the DOM, this attribute is not necessary.
- [`aria-rowindex`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-rowindex) attribute
  - : The `aria-rowindex` attribute is only needed if rows are hidden from the DOM, to indicate which row, in the list of total rows, the current cell is in. The attribute, takes as its value an integer between 1 and the total number of rows within the table, grid, or treegrid, indicating the position, or index, of the cell. For example, a cell in the first row of the first header would likely have `aria-rowindex="1"` set, and cells in row 47 would have `aria-rowindex="47"`, if `aria-rowindex` were needed due to not all rows being in the DOM. If the rows that are visible are contiguous, and there are no cells with a `colspan` or `rowspan` greater than one, this property can be added to the parent rows instead of all the rows' cells.

### Keyboard interactions

None.

### Required JavaScript features

The first rule of ARIA use is if you can use a native feature with the semantics and behavior you require already built in, instead of repurposing an element and **adding** an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible, then do so. Employ the HTML [`<td>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/td) element instead of the ARIA role of `cell` whenever possible.

## Examples

```html

```

The above is a non-semantic ARIA table with five of 81 rows present in the DOM: one within a table header and four rows within the table body. Because not all the rows are in the DOM, we've included the `aria-rowindex` property on every cell. If no cells spanned more than one row or column, the `aria-rowindex` could have been placed on the row rather than the row's individual cells.

## Best practices

Only use {{HTMLElement('table')}}, {{HTMLElement('tbody')}}, {{HTMLElement('thead')}}, {{HTMLElement('tr')}}, {{HTMLElement('th')}}, {{HTMLElement('td')}}, etc., for data table structure. You can add ARIA roles to ensure accessibility should the native semantics of the table be removed, such as with CSS. A relevant use case for the ARIA table role is when the native semantics of a table are overridden by [CSS's display property, such as by display: grid](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display#accessibility). In this case, you can use the ARIA table roles to add the semantics back in.

```html
<table
  role="table"
  aria-label="Semantic Elements"
  aria-describedby="semantic_elements_table_desc"
  aria-rowcount="81">
  <caption id="semantic_elements_table_desc">
    Semantic Elements to use instead of ARIA's roles
  </caption>
  <thead role="rowgroup">
    <tr role="row">
      <th role="columnheader" aria-sort="none" aria-rowindex="1">ARIA Role</th>
      <th role="columnheader" aria-sort="none" aria-rowindex="1">
        Semantic Element
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody role="rowgroup">
    <tr role="row">
      <td role="cell" aria-rowindex="11">header</td>
      <td role="cell" aria-rowindex="11">h1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr role="row">
      <td role="cell" aria-rowindex="16">header</td>
      <td role="cell" aria-rowindex="16">h6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr role="row">
      <td role="cell" aria-rowindex="18">rowgroup</td>
      <td role="cell" aria-rowindex="18">thead</td>
    </tr>
    <tr role="row">
      <td role="cell" aria-rowindex="24">term</td>
      <td role="cell" aria-rowindex="24">dt</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

Above is the semantic way of writing a table. The ARIA roles are not necessary if the native semantics of the table, and therefore the table rows, have not been altered, such as through [the display property](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display#accessibility).

### Added benefits

When applied to a {{HTMLElement('td')}}, it returns cell semantics to the element in case the semantics were removed, such as with `display: grid;`.

# ARIA: checkbox role

The `checkbox` role is for checkable interactive controls. Elements containing `role="checkbox"` must also include the [`aria-checked`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-checked) attribute to expose the checkbox's state to assistive technology.

```html
<span
  role="checkbox"
  aria-checked="false"
  tabindex="0"
  aria-labelledby="chk1-label"></span>
<label id="chk1-label">Remember my preferences</label>
```

> [!NOTE]
> The first rule of ARIA is if a native HTML element or attribute has the semantics and behavior you require, use it instead of re-purposing an element and adding ARIA. Instead use the native [HTML checkbox of `<input type="checkbox">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/checkbox) (with an associated {{HTMLElement('label')}}), which natively provides all the functionality required:

```html
<input type="checkbox" id="chk1-label" name="RememberPreferences" />
<label for="chk1-label">Remember my preferences</label>
```

## Description

The native HTML checkbox ([`<input type="checkbox">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/checkbox)) form control had two states ("checked" or "not checked"), with an [`indeterminate`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/checkbox#indeterminate_state_checkboxes) state settable via JavaScript. Similarly, an element with `role="checkbox"` can expose three states through the `aria-checked` attribute: `true`, `false`, or `mixed`.

Since a checkbox is an interactive control, it must be focusable and keyboard accessible. If the role is applied to a non-focusable element, use the [`tabindex`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/tabindex) attribute to change this. The expected keyboard shortcut for activating a checkbox is the <kbd>Space</kbd> key.

The developer is required to change the value of the `aria-checked` attribute dynamically when the checkbox is activated.

### All descendants are presentational

There are some types of user interface components that, when represented in a platform accessibility API, can only contain text. Accessibility APIs do not have a way of representing semantic elements contained in a `checkbox`. To deal with this limitation, browsers, automatically apply role [`presentation`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/presentation_role) to all descendant elements of any `checkbox` element as it is a role that does not support semantic children.

For example, consider the following `checkbox` element, which contains a heading.

```html
<div role="checkbox"><h6>Name of my checkbox</h6></div>
```

Because descendants of `checkbox` are presentational, the following code is equivalent:

```html
<div role="checkbox"><h6 role="presentation">Name of my checkbox</h6></div>
```

From the assistive technology user's perspective, the heading does not exist since the previous code snippets are equivalent to the following in the [accessibility tree](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessibility_tree):

```html
<div role="checkbox">Name of my checkbox</div>
```

### Associated WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties

- [`aria-checked`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-checked)
  - : The value of `aria-checked` defines the state of a checkbox. This attribute has one of three possible values:
    - `true`
      - : The checkbox is checked.
    - `false`
      - : The checkbox is not checked.
    - `mixed`
      - : The checkbox is partially checked, or indeterminate.

- `tabindex="0"`
  - : Used to make it focusable so the assistive technology user can tab to it and start reading right away.

### Keyboard interactions

| Key              | Function               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| <kbd>Space</kbd> | Activates the checkbox |

### Required JavaScript

#### Required event handlers

- `onclick`
  - : Handle mouse clicks on both the checkbox and the associated label that will change the state of the checkbox by changing the value of the `aria-checked` attribute and the appearance of the checkbox so it appears checked or unchecked to the sighted user
- `onKeyDown`
  - : Handle the case where the user presses the <kbd>Space</kbd> key to change the state of the checkbox by changing the value of the `aria-checked` attribute and the appearance of the checkbox so it appears checked or unchecked to the sighted user

## Examples

The following example creates an otherwise non-semantic checkbox element using CSS and JavaScript to handle the checked or unchecked status of the element.

### HTML

```html
<span
  role="checkbox"
  id="chkPref"
  aria-checked="false"
  tabindex="0"
  aria-labelledby="chk1-label"></span>
<label id="chk1-label">Remember my preferences</label>
```

### CSS

```css
[role="checkbox"] {
  padding: 5px;
}

[role="checkbox"]:focus {
  border: 2px solid #0198e1;
}

[aria-checked="true"]::before {
  content: "[x]";
}

[aria-checked="false"]::before {
  content: "[ ]";
}
```

### JavaScript

```js
const item = document.getElementById("chkPref");
const label = document.getElementById("chk1-label");

function changeCheckbox(code) {
  const checked = item.getAttribute("aria-checked");

  if (code && code !== "Space") {
    return;
  }
  if (checked === "true") {
    item.setAttribute("aria-checked", "false");
  } else {
    item.setAttribute("aria-checked", "true");
  }
}

item.addEventListener("keydown", (event) => {
  changeCheckbox(event.code);
});

label.addEventListener("keydown", (event) => {
  changeCheckbox(event.code);
});

item.addEventListener("click", changeCheckbox);
label.addEventListener("click", changeCheckbox);
```

## Accessibility concerns

When the `checkbox` role is added to an element, the user agent should do the following:

- Expose the element as having a `checkbox` role in the operating system's accessibility API.
- When the `aria-checked` value changes, send an accessible state changed event.

Assistive technology products should do the following:

- Screen readers should announce the element as a checkbox, and optionally provide instructions on how to activate it.

People implementing checkboxes should do the following:

- Ensure that the checkbox can be reached and interacted with by both keyboard controls and clicks
- Keep the `aria-checked` attribute up to date following user interactions
- Provide styles that indicate when the checkbox has focus

> [!NOTE]
> Opinions may differ on how assistive technology should handle this technique. The information provided above is one of those opinions and may change.

## Best practices

The first rule of ARIA is: if a native HTML element or attribute has the semantics and behavior you require, use it instead of re-purposing an element and adding an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible. As such, it is recommended to use the native [HTML checkbox](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/checkbox) using form control instead of recreating a checkbox's functionality with JavaScript and ARIA.

# ARIA: columnheader role

The `columnheader` value of the ARIA role attribute identifies an element as being a cell in a row contains header information for a column, similar to the native {{HTMLElement('th')}} element with column scope.

## Description

An element with `role="columnheader"` nested as a descendant for an element with `role="row"`, is a static tabular structure of a column header cell in a tabular container, either a table or grid, or other chart that needs to show data relationships. To be supported, the columnheader must be nested in an element with the [role of `row`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/row_role).

### Associated WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties

All column headers should be nested within a [row](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/row_role). Every row, in turn, should be nested within a [grid](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/grid_role), [table](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/table_role), or [treegrid](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/row_role), alternatively within a [rowgroup](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/rowgroup_role) nested within one of the above.

- [`aria-sort`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-sort)
  - : Only applied to one column header at a time, if any, the `aria-sort` attribute indicates if a column is sorted in the three values of `ascending` or `descending` order, or `none` for not sorted.

### Keyboard interactions

This role does not support any specific keyboard interaction.

### Required JavaScript features

JavaScript is only required if the `aria-sort` attribute is used.

## Examples

```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr role="row">
      <th role="columnheader" scope="col">
        <button>First Name</button>
      </th>
      <th role="columnheader" scope="col">
        <button>Last Name</button>
      </th>
      <th role="columnheader" scope="col" aria-sort="ascending">
        <button>Company Name</button>
      </th>
      <th role="columnheader" scope="col">
        <button>Job Title</button>
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    …
  </tbody>
</table>
```

## Best practices

Column headers should contain a title or header information for the column.

The first rule of ARIA is: if a native HTML element or attribute has the semantics and behavior you require, use it instead of re-purposing an element and adding an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible. It is recommended to use the native HTML `<th>` element with the `scope` attribute set `<th scope="col">` instead of a `<div>` or other element. If you use semantic HTML's `<th scope="col">` the role attribute is not required, but can be included as a back up to ensure the table retains its semantics should the default semantics be removed with a CSS display property value.

The `aria-sort` attribute can be added to a `<th scope="col">` even when the ARIA role attribute is not specified.

### Prefer HTML

Columnheader has the same semantics `<th scope="col">`.

# ARIA: combobox role

The `combobox` role identifies an element as either an `input` or a `button` that controls another element, such as a `listbox` or `grid`, that can dynamically pop up to help the user set the value. A combobox can be either editable (allowing text input) or select-only (only allowing selection from the popup).

## Description

A `combobox` is a composite widget that combines a named input field with a popup providing possible values for that input field. The purpose of this widget is to improve user experience by helping the user select a value without having to type in the complete value and, optionally depending whether supported values are limited, preventing the user from entering invalid or otherwise unsupported values.

The `combobox` role can be set on either an input element for editable comboboxes, or a button element for select-only comboboxes. This element controls another element, such as a listbox or grid, that can dynamically pop up to help the user set a value.

The element with the `combobox` role can be either an editable single-line text field (using an {{HTMLElement('input')}} element, similar to one with a {{HTMLElement('datalist')}}), or a select-only element (using a `button` element) that only displays the current value without allowing direct text input.

A WAI-ARIA combobox requires only one attribute: [`aria-expanded`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-expanded). However, several other attributes are typically necessary depending on the implementation: [`aria-haspopup`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-haspopup), [`aria-controls`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-controls), [`aria-activedescendant`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-activedescendant), and [`aria-autocomplete`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-autocomplete).

Typically, the initial state of a combobox is collapsed, with `aria-expanded="false"` set. In the collapsed state, only the combobox element and, optionally a sibling button to invoke the popup, are visible. The [`aria-expanded`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-expanded), with the value set to `false`, is required when collapsed, because it indicates to assistive technologies that the widget is expandable.

The combobox is in the expanded state when both the combobox element showing its current value and its associated popup element are visible. When expanded, `aria-expanded="true"` must be set.

The popup element associated with a `combobox` can be either a [`listbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/listbox_role), [`tree`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tree_role), [`grid`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/grid_role), or [`dialog`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/dialog_role) element.

Comboboxes have an implicit [`aria-haspopup`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-haspopup) value of `listbox`, so including this attribute is optional if the popup is a `listbox`. If the combobox popup element is a `tree`, `grid`, or `dialog` (anything other than a `listbox`), the `aria-haspopup` attribute is required. The value of `aria-haspopup` must be either the `tree`, `grid`, `dialog`, or `listbox` role. Note that for this property, `true` means `menu`, so make sure that the value corresponds to the role of the popup, not a Boolean value.

When a combobox's popup is displayed, ensure the [`aria-controls`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-controls) attribute on the combobox element is set to the [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/id) of the popup `listbox`, `tree`, `grid`, or `dialog` element. This is how the relationship between the element with the `combobox` role and the popup it controls is indicated. (Note: In older ARIA specs, this was `aria-owns` rather than `aria-controls`, so you may see `aria-owns` in older combobox implementations. The `aria-owns` in the code should be updated to `aria-controls`!)

If the combobox UI includes a visible control, such as an icon, that allows the visibility of the popup to be controlled via pointer and touch events, that control should be a {{HTMLElement('button')}}, {{HTMLElement('input')}} of type `button`, or a [`button`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/button_role) role element with a [`tabindex`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/tabindex) of `-1`. Doing so will allow the button to be focusable but not included in keyboard tab sequence. It must not be a descendant of the element with role `combobox`.

To be keyboard accessible, keyboard support for moving focus between the `combobox` element and elements contained in the popup `listbox`, `tree`, `grid`, or `dialog`, must be programmed in. One common convention is that <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> moves focus from the input to the first focusable descendant of the popup element.

The [`aria-activedescendant`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-activedescendant) property can be used to identify the currently active element of the combobox popup, for instance an `option` within a popup `listbox`, for implementations where DOM focus remains on the combobox. If DOM focus does not remain on the combobox when its popup is invoked, but rather DOM focus moves into the popup, such as a dialog, then `aria-activedescendant` may not be necessary.

If the combobox is implemented as an editable {{HTMLElement('input')}} element, the value of the combobox is the input's value. For select-only comboboxes implemented with a `button` element, the value comes from the selected option in the popup.

The [`aria-autocomplete`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-autocomplete) attribute is only applicable for editable comboboxes that support text input. For these comboboxes, set the attribute to a value that corresponds to the provided behavior: `inline`, `list`, or `both`. The attribute indicates that inputting text will trigger display of one or more predictions of the user's intended value and specifies how these predictions will be presented. For select-only comboboxes using a `button` element, `aria-autocomplete` should not be used since no text input is possible.

Every `combobox` must have an accessible name, which can be provided in one of three ways:

1. For an {{HTMLElement('input')}} element, use an associated {{HTMLElement('label')}}.
2. If a visible label exists in the UI, use [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) referencing the label element's `id`.
3. If no visible label is present, use [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label).

> [!NOTE]
> Use only one of these methods; do not combine them.

### Associated WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties

- [`aria-expanded`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-expanded)
  - : Required. Identifies whether the combobox is open (`true`) or closed (`false`).
- [`aria-haspopup`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-haspopup)
  - : Implied. If omitted, defaults to `listbox`. Also supports `tree`, `grid`, or `dialog`. Identifies the combobox has having a popout, and indicates the type.

### Keyboard interactions

- <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>
  - : Opens the popup if closed and moves focus to the next option, or to the first option if none was selected.

- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> (Optional)
  - : If the popup is available but not displayed, displays the popup without moving focus.

- <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd>
  - : Opens the popup if closed and moves focus to the previous option, or to the last option if none was selected.

- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> (Optional)
  - : If the popup has focus, returns focus to the combobox, otherwise it closes the popup.

- <kbd>Escape</kbd>
  - : Closes the popup if open. If the popup is already closed, clears the combobox value for editable comboboxes.

#### Editable combobox keyboard interactions

- <kbd>Enter</kbd>
  - : If an autocomplete suggestion is selected in the popup, accepts the suggestion by updating the combobox value and placing the input cursor at the end.
    May also trigger a default action (e.g., in a messaging application, adding the accepted value to a list of recipients).

- <kbd>Tab</kbd>
  - : Accepts the current value and moves focus to the next focusable element.

#### Select-only combobox keyboard interactions

- <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd>
  - : When the popup is closed, opens the popup. When the popup is open and an option is selected, accepts the selected option as the combobox value and closes the popup.

- <kbd>Tab</kbd>
  - : Accepts the current selection and moves focus to the next focusable element.

- <kbd>Home</kbd> or <kbd>End</kbd>
  - : When the popup is open, moves focus to the first or last option respectively.

> The comment role is proposed in WAI-ARIA 1.3 ([Most recent ARIA draft](https://w3c.github.io/aria/)), which is still being drafted.

## Examples

In the following example we have a document section that has been commented. The commented section is marked up using `<span role="mark">`.

The related comment is marked up using an HTML structure wrapped with a `<div>` containing `role="comment"`.

```html
<p>
  The last half of the song is a slow-rising crescendo that peaks at the
  <span role="mark" aria-details="thread-1">end of the guitar solo</span>,
  before fading away sharply.
</p>

<div role="comment" id="thread-1" data-author="chris">
  <h3>Chris said</h3>
  <p class="comment-text">I really think this moment could use more cowbell.</p>
  <p><time datetime="2019-03-30T19:29">March 30 2019, 19:29</time></p>
</div>
```

To associate the comment with the text being commented, we need to wrap the commented text with an element containing the [`aria-details`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-details) attribute, the value of which should be the ID of the comment.

### Multiple comments

Since `aria-details` can now accept multiple IDs, we can associate multiple comments with the same annotation, like so:

```html
<p>
  The last half of the song is a slow-rising crescendo that peaks at the
  <mark aria-details="thread-1 thread-2">end of the guitar solo</mark>, before
  fading away sharply.
</p>

<div role="comment" id="thread-1" data-author="chris">
  <h3>Chris said</h3>
  <p class="comment-text">I really think this moment could use more cowbell.</p>
  <p><time datetime="2019-03-30T19:29">March 30 2019, 19:29</time></p>
</div>

<div role="comment" id="thread-2" data-author="chris">
  <h3>Marcus said</h3>
  <p class="comment-text">
    The guitar solo could do with a touch more chorus, and a slightly lower
    volume.
  </p>
  <p><time datetime="2019-03-29T15:35">March 29 2019, 15:35</time></p>
</div>
```

### Nested comments

It's possible to nest comments inside one another, like so:

```html
<div role="comment" id="thread-1" data-author="chris">
  <h3>Chris said</h3>
  <p class="comment-text">I really think this moment could use more cowbell.</p>
  <p><time datetime="2021-03-30T19:29">March 30 2021, 19:29</time></p>

  <div role="comment" data-author="marcus">
    <h3>Marcus replied</h3>
    <p class="comment-text">
      I don't know about that. I think the cowbell could distract from the solo.
    </p>
    <p><time datetime="2021-03-30T21:02">March 30 2021, 21:02</time></p>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Accessibility concerns

None.

# ARIA: complementary role

The `complementary` [landmark role](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles#3._landmark_roles) is used to designate a supporting section that relates to the main content, yet can stand alone when separated. These sections are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes. If possible, use the [HTML \<aside> element](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/aside) instead.

```html
<div role="complementary">
  <h2>Our partners</h2>
  <!-- complementary section content -->
</div>
```

This is a sidebar containing links to project sponsors.

## Description

The `complementary` role is [a landmark](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Guides/Techniques#landmark_roles) role. Landmarks can be used by assistive technology to quickly identify and navigate to large sections of the document. Content listed within a container with the `complementary` landmark role should make sense if separated from the main content of the document.

> [!NOTE]
> Using the {{HTMLElement('aside')}} element will automatically communicate a section has a role of `complementary`. Developers should always prefer using the correct semantic HTML element over using ARIA.

## Examples

```html
<div role="complementary">
  <h2>Trending articles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#">18 tweets that will make you feel all the feels</a></li>
    <li>
      <a href="#">Stop searching! I've found the perfect lunch containers.</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="#">The time has come to decide how to call these foods</a>
    </li>
    <li><a href="#">17 really good posts we saw on Tumblr this week</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">10 parent hacks we know work because we tried them</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

## Accessibility concerns

[Landmark roles](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Guides/Techniques#landmark_roles) are intended to be used sparingly, to identify larger overall sections of the document. Using too many landmark roles can create "noise" in screen readers, making it difficult to understand the overall layout of the page.

## Best practices

### Prefer HTML

Using the {{HTMLElement('aside')}} element will automatically communicate that the element has a role of `complementary`. If possible, prefer using the semantic `<aside>` element instead of the `complementary` role.

### Labeling landmarks

#### Multiple landmarks

If there is more than one `complementary` landmark role or {{HTMLElement('aside')}} element in a document, provide a label for each landmark using the [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) attribute, or, if the aside has an appropriately descriptive title, point to it with the [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) attribute. This label will allow an assistive technology user to be able to quickly understand the purpose of each landmark.

```html
<aside aria-label="Note about usage">
  <!-- content -->
</aside>

…

<aside id="sidebar" aria-label="Sponsors">
  <!-- content -->
</aside>
```

#### Redundant descriptions

Screen readers will announce the type of role the landmark is. Because of this, you do not need to describe what the landmark is in its label. For example, a declaration of `role="complementary"` with an of `aria-label="Sidebar"` may be announced redundantly as, "complementary sidebar".

### Added benefits

Certain technologies such as browser extensions can generate lists of all landmark roles present on a page, allowing non-screen reader users to also quickly identify and navigate to large sections of the document.

# ARIA: composite role

The `composite` [abstract role](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles#6._abstract_roles) indicates a widget that may contain navigable descendants or owned children.

> [!WARNING]
> The `composite` role is an abstract role. It is included here for completeness of documentation. It should not be used by web authors.

## Description

`Composite` is an abstract role used for the ontology. Don't use this role in content. Instead, use the composite subclasses of [`grid`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/grid_role), [`select`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/select_role), [`spinbutton`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/spinbutton_role), and [`tablist`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tablist_role).

# ARIA: contentinfo role

The `contentinfo` role defines a footer, containing identifying information such as copyright information, navigation links, and privacy statements, found on every document within a site. This section is commonly called a footer.

```html
<div role="contentinfo">
  <h2>Footer</h2>
  <!-- footer content -->
</div>
```

This is a website footer. Using the {{HTMLElement('footer')}} element instead is recommended:

```html
<footer>
  <h2>Footer</h2>
  <!-- footer content -->
</footer>
```

## Description

The `contentinfo` role is [a landmark](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles#3._landmark_roles) used to identify a page footer. Landmarks can be used by assistive technology to quickly identify and navigate to large sections of the document. Pages should only include one top-level `contentinfo` landmark role per page.

Each page should only include one `contentinfo` landmark, created by either using the {{HTMLElement('footer')}} element or by declaring `role="contentinfo"`. `contentinfo` landmarks present in content embedded via {{HTMLElement('iframe')}} do not count towards this limit.

> [!NOTE]
> Using the {{HTMLElement('footer')}} element will automatically communicate a section has a role of `contentinfo`. Developers should always prefer using the correct semantic HTML element over using ARIA, making sure to {{HTMLElement('footer#accessibility', 'test for known issues')}} in VoiceOver.

## Examples

```html
<body>
  <!-- other page content -->

  <div role="contentinfo">
    <h2>MDN Web Docs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#">Web Technologies</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Learn Web Development</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">About MDN</a></li>

```

## Accessibility concerns

### Use sparingly

[Landmark roles](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles#3._landmark_roles) are intended to identify larger overall sections of the document. Using too many landmark roles can create "noise" in screen readers, making it difficult to understand the overall layout of the page.

### One `contentinfo` landmark per page

#### The `<body>` element

There should be only one `contentinfo` landmark per document, used as the immediate descendant of the {{HTMLElement('body')}} element.

#### Mega-footers

Do not nest additional {{HTMLElement('footer')}} elements or `contentinfo` landmarks inside the document's footer. Use other [content sectioning elements](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements#content_sectioning) instead.

### Labeling landmarks

#### Multiple landmarks

If there is more than one `contentinfo` landmark role or {{HTMLElement('footer')}} element in a document, provide a label with the [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) attribute for each landmark. This label will allow assistive technology users to quickly understand the purpose of each landmark.

```html
<body>
  …

  <article>
    <h2>Everyday Pad Thai</h2>
    <!-- article content -->
    <footer aria-label="Everyday Pad Thai metadata">
      <p>
        Posted on <time datetime="2021-09-23 12:17">September 23</time> by
        <a href="#">Lisa</a>.
      </p>
    </footer>
  </article>

  …

  <footer aria-label="Footer">
    <!-- footer content -->
  </footer>
</body>
```

#### Redundant descriptions

Screen readers will announce the type of role the landmark is. Because of this, you do not need to describe what the landmark is in its label. For example, a declaration of `role="contentinfo"` with an of `aria-label="Footer"` may be announced redundantly as, "contentinfo footer".

## Best practices

### Prefer HTML

When it is an immediate descendant of the {{HTMLElement('body')}} using the {{HTMLElement('footer')}} element will automatically communicate a section has a role of `contentinfo` (save for {{HTMLElement('footer#accessibility', 'a known issue')}} in VoiceOver). If at all possible, prefer using `<footer>` instead. Note that a `footer` element nested within an `article`, `aside`, `main`, `nav`, or `section` is not considered `contentinfo`.

### Added benefits

Certain technologies such as browser extensions can generate lists of all landmark roles present on a page, allowing non-screen reader users to also quickly identify and navigate to large sections of the document.

# ARIA: definition role

The `definition` ARIA role indicates the element is a definition of a term or concept.

## Description

The `definition` ARIA role can be included on an element that is a definition of a term or concept, similar to the native {{HTMLElement('dfn')}} element. To associate the definition with the `term` being defined, and to provide an accessible name, reference the term being defined with `role="term"`, using [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby).

```html-nolint
<p>
  <span role="term">Mansplaining</span>,
  <span role="definition">
    a portmanteau of "man" and "explain", is the patronizing act of explaining
    without being asked to do so, to someone already learned on the topic, often
    after someone has already explained it
  </span>.
</p>
```

> [!NOTE]
> Instead of a `<span>` with the [`term`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/term_role) and `definition` roles, use the {{HTMLElement('dfn')}} element. **Always use native element if available.**

```html
<p>
  <dfn>Mansplaining</dfn>, a portmanteau of "man" and "explain", is the
  patronizing act of explaining without being asked to do so, to someone already
  learned on the topic, often after someone has already explained it.

# ARIA: dialog role

The `dialog` role is used to mark up an HTML based application dialog or window that separates content or UI from the rest of the web application or page. Dialogs are generally placed on top of the rest of the page content using an overlay. Dialogs can be either non-modal (it's still possible to interact with content outside of the dialog) or modal (only the content in the dialog can be interacted with).

```html
<div
  role="dialog"
  aria-labelledby="dialog1Title"
  aria-describedby="dialog1Desc">
  <h2 id="dialog1Title">Your personal details were successfully updated</h2>
  <p id="dialog1Desc">
    You can change your details at any time in the user account section.
  </p>
  <button>Close</button>
</div>
```

## Description

A dialog is a descendant window of the primary window of a web application. For HTML pages, the primary application window is the entire web document, i.e., the body element.

Marking up a dialog element with the `dialog` role helps assistive technology identify the dialog's content as being grouped and separated from the rest of the page content. However, adding `role="dialog"` alone is not sufficient to make a dialog accessible. Additionally, the following needs to be done:

- The dialog must be properly labeled
- Keyboard focus must be managed correctly

The sections below describe how these two requirements can be met.

### Labeling

Even though it is not required for the dialog itself to be able to receive focus, it still needs to be labeled. The label given to the dialog will provide contextual information for the interactive controls inside the dialog. In other words, the dialog's label acts like a grouping label for the controls inside it (similar to how a `<legend>` element provides a grouping label for the controls inside a `<fieldset>` element).

If a dialog already has a visible title bar, the text inside that bar can be used to label the dialog itself. The best way to achieve this is by using the [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) attribute to the `role="dialog"` element. Additionally, if the dialog contains additional descriptive text besides the dialog title, this text can be associated with the dialog using the [`aria-describedby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-describedby) attribute. This approach is shown in the code snippet below:

```html
<div
  role="dialog"
  aria-labelledby="dialog1Title"
  aria-describedby="dialog1Desc">
  <h2 id="dialog1Title">Your personal details were successfully updated</h2>
  <p id="dialog1Desc">
    You can change your details at any time in the user account section.
  </p>
  <button>Close</button>
</div>
```

> [!NOTE]
> Keep in mind that a dialog's title and description text do not have to be focusable in order to be perceived by screen readers operating in a non-virtual mode. The combination of the ARIA dialog role and labeling techniques should make the screen reader announce the dialog's information when focus is moved into it.

### Required JavaScript features

#### Focus management

A dialog has particular requirements for how keyboard focus should be managed:

- Dialogs should always have at least one focusable control. For many dialogs, there will be a button like "Close", "OK" or "Cancel". In addition to the needed control, dialogs can contain any number of focusable elements, even entire forms or other container widgets like tabs.
- When the dialog appears on the screen, keyboard focus (whose control depends upon the dialog's purpose) should be moved to the default focusable control inside the dialog. For dialogs that only provide a basic message, it could be an "OK" button. For dialogs containing a form it could be the first field in the form.
- After the dialog is dismissed, keyboard focus should be moved back to where it was before it moved into the dialog. Otherwise the focus can be dropped to the beginning of the page.
- For most dialogs, the expected behavior is that the dialog's tab order _wraps_, which means that when the user tabs through the focusable elements in the dialog, the first focusable element will be focused after the last one has been reached. In other words, the tab order should be contained within and by the dialog.
- If the dialog can be moved or resized, ensure that these actions must be performable by keyboard users as well as mouse users. Similarly, if a dialog provides special features like toolbars or context menus, these must be reachable and operable by keyboard users as well.
- Dialogs can be modal or non-modal. When a _modal_ dialog appears on the screen, it's not possible to interact with any page content outside the dialog. In other words, the main application UI or page content is considered to be temporarily disabled as long as the modal dialog is showing. For _non-modal_ dialogs it is still possible to interact with content outside of the dialog while the dialog is showing. Note that for non-modal dialogs there will have to be a global keyboard shortcut that allows focus to be moved between opened dialogs and the main page.

### Associated ARIA roles, states, and properties

- [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby)
  - : Use this attribute to label the dialog. Often, the value of the `aria-labelledby` attribute will be the id of the element used to title the dialog.
- [`aria-describedby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-describedby)
  - : Use this attribute to describe the contents of the dialog.

### Possible effects on user agents and assistive technology

When the `dialog` role is used, the user agent should do the following:

- Expose the element as a dialog in the operating system's accessibility API.

When the dialog is correctly labeled and focus is moved to an element (often an interactive element, such as a button) inside the dialog, screen readers should announce the dialog's accessible role, name and optionally description, along with announcing the focused element.

> [!NOTE]
> Opinions may differ on how assistive technology should handle this technique, and the order of announcements may differ depending on the assistive technology used. The information provided above is one of those opinions and may change as the specification is defined.

## Examples

### A dialog containing a form

```html
<div
  role="dialog"
  aria-labelledby="dialog1Title"
  aria-describedby="dialog1Desc">
  <h2 id="dialog1Title">Subscription Form</h2>
  <p id="dialog1Desc">We will not share this information with third parties.</p>
  <form>
    <p>
      <label for="firstName">First Name</label>
      <input id="firstName" type="text" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <label for="lastName">Last Name</label>
      <input id="lastName" type="text" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <label for="interests">Interests</label>
      <textarea id="interests"></textarea>
    </p>
    <p>
      <input type="checkbox" id="autoLogin" name="autoLogin" />
      <label for="autoLogin">Auto-login?</label>
    </p>
    <p>
      <input type="submit" value="Save Information" />
    </p>
  </form>
</div>
```

#### Working Examples

- [jQuery-UI Dialog](https://jqueryui.com/dialog/)

### Notes

> [!NOTE]
> While it is possible to prevent keyboard users from moving focus to elements outside of the dialog, screen reader users may still be able to navigate to that content using their screen reader's virtual cursor.
> It is important for developers to ensure that content outside of the modal dialog is inaccessible to all users while the modal dialog is active.

# ARIA: directory role

The `directory` role was for a list of references to members of a group, such as a static table of contents.

> [!WARNING]
> The `directory` role was deprecated in ARIA 1.2

## Description

A directory is a static table of contents, whether linked or unlinked. This includes tables of contents built with lists, including nested lists. Dynamic tables of contents, however, might use a tree role instead.

The deprecated `directory` role was used for lists of references to members of a group, such as a static table of contents.
Use the [`list`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/list_role) role instead. Or, better yet, use the {{HTMLElement('ul')}} or {{HTMLElement('ol')}} elements, as using `directory` does not provide any additional benefits to assistive technology users.

# ARIA: document role

The `document` role is for focusable content within complex composite [widgets](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/widget_role) or [applications](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/application_role) for which assistive technologies can switch reading context back to a reading mode.

## Description

The `document` role is for the top container containing content that assistive technology users may want to browse in a reading mode. Only useful on focusable sections within complex composite [widgets](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/widget_role) or [applications](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/application_role), the `document` role informs assistive technologies to the reading context back to a reading mode: The `document` role tells assistive technologies with reading or browse modes to use the document mode to read the content contained within this element.

```html
<div role="dialog">
  …
  <div id="InfoText" role="document" tabindex="0">
    <p>Some informational text goes here.</p>
  </div>
  …
  <button>Close</button>
</div>
```

This example shows a [dialog](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/dialog_role), a complex composite widget role, with some controls and a section with some informational text that the assistive technology user can go into reading mode when tabbed to.

By default, web pages are treated as documents; assistive technologies (AT) enter browse or read mode when entering a new web page. This mode can be altered through various roles, including the widget and application roles. The `document` role brings the AT back into browse or read mode.

Generally placed within an application role or other interactive widget role, the `document` role is used to indicate a section of a complex composite widget that an assistive technology user should read using its browse or virtual reading mode, if available.

Because ATs with reading mode default to that mode for all elements except for those with a widget or application role set, document role is only useful for focusable elements within a widget or application that should be read as static rich text. Adding `role="document"` and `tabindex="0"` to the element containing the text within a widget enables the screen reader user to press the Tab key to place focus on the document element and read the text with the screen reader's reading cursor.

Assistive technologies should switch context back to document mode, possibly intercepting from controls rewired for the parent's dynamic context, re-enabling the standard input events, such as Up or Down arrow keyboard events, to control the reading cursor.

In contrast to the [`article`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/article_role) role, the `document` role does not have any relation to other elements with a document role, it merely has a relationship to the containing composite widget. An article can have associated articles.

### Associated WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties

- [`aria-expanded`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-expanded)
  - : Include with a value of `true` or `false` if the document element is collapsible, to indicate if the document is currently expanded or collapsed. Other values include the default `undefined` which means the document is not collapsible.

- tabindex="0"
  - : Used to make it focusable so the assistive technology user can tab to it and start reading right away.

### Keyboard interactions

The element should be made focusable by setting the `tabindex="0"` attribute / value pair on it. This way, the user can tab to it, reading mode is invoked automatically, and the content can be read right away.

### Required JavaScript features

None, except as required by any attributes. For example, if the `document` is collapsible, then the state and the value of `aria-expanded` must be maintained.

## Examples

An example is Gmail and the single conversation view. GMail is a web application. When in GMail, most user agent interactions are usurped by the application. However, when the Keyboard focus is set on the starting heading on a single conversation that contains the subject of the conversation, the screen reader user can use the reading mode commands to read through the messages, expand or collapse them, and manipulate them. Once focus returns to the message list either by activating the Back button or pressing an associated keystroke, direct application interaction mode is invoked again, and the user can move to a different conversation in the list with the <kbd>arrow</kbd> keys.

## Best practices

Always make sure an item with the document role is focusable, by setting the `tabindex` attribute with a value of 0. That will also include it in the tab order.

### Added benefits

The document role is an easy way to indirectly control assistive technology behavior by unambiguously stating that this is content the user should read with standard screen reader commands.

# ARIA: feed role

A `feed` is a dynamic scrollable `list` of `articles` in which articles are added to or removed from either end of the list as the user scrolls. A `feed` enables screen readers to use the browse mode reading cursor to both read and scroll through a stream of rich content that may continue scrolling infinitely by loading more content as the user reads.

```html
<section role="feed" aria-busy="false">

## Description

A `feed` is a type of [`list`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/list_role), the containing role for scrollable [`articles`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/article_role) where scrolling may cause articles to be added to the top or end of the list. The role enables assistive technology to use the browse mode reading cursor to both read and scroll through a stream of rich content that may continue scrolling infinitely by loading more content as the user reads. Examples include an RSS feed, news feeds, social media feeds like Facebook, Instagram or Mastodon, or even a list of related products on an e-commerce page. These streams can be limited or infinite, loading more content as the user scrolls. Implementing the `feed` pattern allows a screen reader to reliably read and trigger the loading of feed content while in reading mode.

Unlike the document structure elements that represent static HTML elements, the `feed` role requires specific interactions and implementation of keyboard navigation. The `feed` is a container element whose children are {{HTMLElement('article')}}s or have role `article`. Each article within a feed should be focusable, with tabindex of 0 or -1. An article should be scrolled into view when it, or a descendant element, receives focus. If the addition of articles occupies the main browser thread, make sure to set `aria-busy="true"` on the feed itself, and make sure to set it back to `false` when processing ends, or the user may not see the updates.

If the number of articles is known, set [`aria-setsize`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-setsize) on the articles themselves. However, if the total number is extremely large, indefinite, or changes often, set `aria-setsize="-1"` to indicate that the size of the feed is not known.

Another feature of the feed pattern is skim reading: Articles within a feed can contain both an accessible name with the [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) and a description with an `aria-describedby`, suggesting to screen readers which elements to speak after the label when navigating by article. By identifying the elements inside an article that provide the title and the primary content, assistive technologies can provide functions that enable users to jump from article to article and efficiently discern which articles they want to read.

The feed pattern enables reliable assistive technology reading mode interaction by establishing the following interoperability agreement between the web page and assistive technologies:

In the context of a feed, the web page code is responsible for:

- Appropriate visual scrolling of the content based on which article contains DOM focus.
- Loading or removing feed articles based on which article contains DOM focus.

### Keyboard interactions

Supporting the following, or a similar, interface is recommended when focus is inside the feed:

- <kbd>Page Down</kbd>: Move focus to next article.
- <kbd>Page Up</kbd>: Move focus to previous article.
- <kbd>Control + End</kbd>: Move focus to the first focusable element after the feed.
- <kbd>Control + Home</kbd>: Move focus to the first focusable element before the feed.

If a feed is nested within a feed, such as a comments feed within a feed of blog posts, the convention is to tab into the nested feed with the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key and to provide another key, such as <kbd>Alt + Page Down</kbd>, to navigate from an 'outer' article to the first item in that article's nested feed. Navigate between the nested feed and main feed with <kbd>Control + End</kbd>, moving focus from the inner feed to the next article in the outer feed.

### <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> roles, states, and properties

- [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label)
  - : If the feed has no visible title, the `feed` element has a label specified with `aria-label`. If it does, see `aria-labelledby`.

- [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby)
  - : If the feed has a visible title, the `feed` element has `aria-labelledby` referring to the element containing the title. If not, add an `aria-label`.

- [`aria-busy`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-busy)
  - : When busy, such as when articles are being added or removed from the `feed`, set `aria-busy="true"` during the update operation. Make sure it's reset to `false` when the operation is complete or the changes may not become visible.

- article
  - : Each section of content in a feed should be contained in an `<article>` or element with role [`article`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/article_role). Each `article` should have an `aria-labelledby` referring to the article title or other child that can serve as a distinguishing label. Each article should preferably have `aria-describedby` referring to one or more elements inside the article that serve as the primary content of the article. Each `article` element has [`aria-posinset`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-posinset) set to a value that represents its position in the feed and an [`aria-setsize`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-setsize) set to a value that represents either the total number of articles that have been loaded or the total number in the feed, depending on which value is more helpful to users. If the total number in the feed is not known, set `aria-setsize="-1"`.

### Required JavaScript features

None, except as required by any attributes. For example, setting [`aria-busy`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-busy) to `true` during the update operation if needed, and then to `false` upon completion.

Note: It is the author's responsibility to apply the "above" keyboard behavior.

## Examples

[Example Implementation of Feed Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/feed/examples/feed/)

## Best practices

To ensure good user experience, avoid inserting or removing articles in the middle of a `feed`, load new articles before the user has reached the end of the feed, and provide keyboard commands for moving focus among articles so that keyboard users can navigate through your feed. See [Keyboard interactions](#keyboard_interactions).

# ARIA: figure role

The ARIA `figure` role can be used to identify a figure inside page content where appropriate semantics do not already exist. A figure is generally considered to be one or more images, code snippets, or other content that puts across information in a different way to a regular flow of text.

## Description

A `figure` is a perceivable section of content that typically contains a graphical document, images, code snippets, or example text. The parts of a figure MAY be user-navigable. Any content that should be grouped together and consumed as a figure (which could include images, video, audio, code snippets, or other content) can be identified as a figure using `role="figure"`.

```html
<div role="figure" aria-labelledby="caption">
  <img src="image.png" alt="put image description here" />
  <p id="caption">Figure 1: The caption</p>
</div>
```

In the above example, we have a figure that consists of two separate content items — an image and a caption. This is wrapped by a {{htmlelement("div")}} element that identifies the content as a figure using `role="figure"`.

For HTML, use the {{HTMLElement('figure')}} and {{HTMLElement('figcaption')}} elements. The figcaption will serve as the accessible name for the figure. When not using HTML, or when retrofitting legacy HTML, use the [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) on the figure, pointing to the figure's caption.
If there is no visible caption, [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) can be used.

```html
<div role="figure" aria-labelledby="figure-1">
  …
  <p id="figure-1">Text that describes the figure.</p>
</div>
```

- Use `aria-labelledby` when the text is a concise label.
- Use [`aria-describedby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-describedby) when the text is a longer description.
- Use [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) when there is no visible figure caption.

This can be done semantically, without ARIA, with HTML's {{HTMLElement('figure')}} element along with {{HTMLElement('figcaption')}}.

```html
<figure>
  <img src="image.png" alt="put image description here" />
  <figcaption>Figure 1: The caption</figcaption>
</figure>
```

> [!NOTE]
> If at all possible in your work, you should use the appropriate semantic HTML elements to mark up a figure and its caption — {{htmlelement("figure")}} and {{htmlelement("figcaption")}}.

### Associated WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties

- [`aria-describedby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-describedby)
  - : The id of an element containing reference text serving as a caption.
- [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby)
  - : The id of an element containing text serving as a label.
- [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label)
  - : If there is no element containing text that could serve as a label, you can add the label directly as a value on the `aria-label` on the element with the `figure` role or on the `<figure>` element.

### Keyboard interactions

No role specific keyboard interactions.

### Required JavaScript features

No role specific JavaScript requirements. If you don't have control over the HTML semantics, you can improve the accessibility of HTML by adding these roles and properties with JavaScript.

## Examples

We could extend the initial example on the page to also identify a paragraph that provides a descriptive label for the figure by referencing its ID in `aria-labelledby`:

```html
<div role="figure" aria-labelledby="figure-1">
  <img
    src="diagram.png"
    alt="diagram showing the four layers of awesome and their relative priority order —
        music, cats, nature, and ice cream" />
  <pre>
`
        let awesome = ['music', 'cats', 'nature', 'ice cream'];
      `</pre
  >
  <p id="figure-1">Figure 1: The four layers of awesome.</p>
</div>
```

## Best practices

Only use `role="figure"` if you have to — for example if you don't have control over your HTML but are able to improve accessibility dynamically after the fact with JavaScript.

If at all possible, you should use the appropriate semantic HTML elements to mark up a figure and its caption — {{htmlelement("figure")}} and {{htmlelement("figcaption")}}. For example, our above example should be rewritten as follows:

```html
<figure>
  <img
    src="diagram.png"
    alt="diagram showing the four layers of awesome and their relative priority order —
         music, cats, nature, and ice cream" />
  <pre>
`
    let awesome = ['music', 'cats', 'nature', 'ice cream'];
  `</pre
  >
  <figcaption>Figure 1: The four layers of awesome.</figcaption>
</figure>
```

# ARIA: form role

The `form` role can be used to identify a group of elements on a page that provide equivalent functionality to an HTML form. The form is not exposed as a landmark region unless it has an [accessible name](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessible_name).

```html
<div role="form" id="contact-info" aria-label="Contact information">
  <!-- form content -->
</div>
```

This is a form that collects and saves a user's contact information.

> [!WARNING]
> Use an HTML {{htmlelement("form")}} element to contain your form controls, rather than the ARIA `form` role, unless you have a very good reason.
> The HTML `<form>` element is sufficient to tell assistive technologies that there is a form.

## Description

A `form` [landmark](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles#3._landmark_roles) identifies a region of content that contains a collection of items and objects that, as a whole, combine to create a form when no other named landmark is appropriate (e.g., [`main`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/main_role) or [`search`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/search_role)).

> [!NOTE]
> Using the {{HTMLElement('form')}} element will automatically communicate a section of content as a `form` landmark, if it is provided an accessible name. Developers should always prefer using the correct semantic HTML element over using ARIA.

Use the HTML {{HTMLElement('form')}} element if possible. The `<form>` element defines a `form` landmark when it has an accessible name (e.g., [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby), [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) or [`title`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/title)). Make sure to have a unique label on each form in a document to help users understand the purpose of the form. This label should be visible to all users, not just assistive technology users. Use the `search` landmark instead of the `form` landmark when the form is used for search functionality.

Use the `role="form"` to identify a region of the page; do not use it to identify every form field. Even if you are using the form landmark instead of `<form>`, you are encouraged to use native HTML form controls like {{HTMLElement('button')}}, {{HTMLElement('input')}}, {{HTMLElement('select')}}, and {{HTMLElement('textarea')}}.

### Associated WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties

No role specific states or properties.

### Keyboard interactions

No role specific keyboard interactions

### Required JavaScript features

- `onsubmit`
  - : The onSubmit event handler handles the event raised when the form is submitted. Anything that is not a `<form>` cannot be submitted, therefore you would have to use JavaScript to build an alternative data submission mechanism, for example with {{domxref("Window/fetch", "fetch()")}}.

## Examples

```html
<div role="form" id="send-comment" aria-label="Add a comment">
  <label for="username">Username</label>
  <input
    id="username"
    name="username"
    autocomplete="nickname"
    autocorrect="off"
    type="text" />

  <label for="email">Email</label>
  <input
    id="email"
    name="email"
    autocomplete="email"
    autocapitalize="off"
    autocorrect="off"
    spellcheck="false"
    type="text" />

  <label for="comment">Comment</label>
  <textarea id="comment" name="comment"></textarea>

  <input value="Comment" type="submit" />
</div>
```

It is recommended to use `<form>` instead.

```html
<form id="send-comment" aria-label="Add a comment">…</form>
```

## Accessibility concerns

### Use sparingly

[Landmark roles](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles#3._landmark_roles) are intended to identify larger overall sections of the document. Using too many landmark roles can create "noise" in screen readers, making it difficult to understand the overall layout of the page.

### Inputs are not forms

You do not need to declare `role="form"` on every [form element](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements#forms) (inputs, text areas, selects, etc.). It should be declared on the HTML element that wraps the form elements. Ideally, use the {{HTMLElement('form')}} element as the wrapping element and do not declare `role="form"`.

### Search

If a form is used to search, you should use the more specialized [`role="search"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/search_role) value.

### Labeling landmarks

Each {{HTMLElement('form')}} element and form `role` that needs to be exposed as a landmark must be given an accessible name. This name will allow an assistive technology user to be able to quickly understand the purpose of the form landmark.

Use an `aria-labelledby`, `aria-label` or `title` on the same element that was given the `role="form"` to provide it an accessible name.

#### Using `role="form"`

```html
<div role="form" id="gift-cards" aria-label="Purchase a gift card">
  <!-- form content -->
</div>
```

#### Redundant descriptions

Screen readers will announce the type of role the landmark is. Because of this, you do not need to describe what the landmark is in its label. For example, a declaration of `role="form"` with an of `aria-label="Contact form"` may be announced redundantly as, "contact form form".

## Best practices

### Prefer HTML

Using the {{HTMLElement('form')}} element will automatically communicate that the element has a role of `form`. If possible, prefer using the semantic `<form>` element instead of the `form` role.

# ARIA: generic role

The `generic` role creates a nameless container element which has no semantic meaning on its own.

> [!NOTE]
> The `generic` role is the implicit role of generic elements used by user agents. It is included here for completeness of documentation. It should not be used by web authors.

## Description

While ARIA is primarily used to express semantics, there are some elements that shouldn't expose a semantic name to assistive technologies. The `generic` role indicates an element's role is equivalent to that of the non-semantic {{HTMLElement('div')}} and {{HTMLElement('span')}} elements.

The `generic` role is intended for use as the implicit role of generic elements in host languages for use by user agents only; not for use by developers. Instead, to remove implicit accessibility semantics, use [`presentation`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/presentation_role) or `none`, the {{HTMLElement('div')}} and {{HTMLElement('span')}} elements that have no semantic meaning, or semantic container roles such as [`group`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/group_role) to semantically group descendants in a named container.

Like an element with role `presentation`, an element with `role="generic"` can provide a limited number of accessible states and properties for its descendants, such as [`aria-live`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-live) attributes. However, unlike elements with role `presentation`, `generic` elements are exposed in accessibility APIs so that assistive technologies can gather certain properties such as layout and bounds.

Because the generic role is nameless, the [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) and [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) attributes are prohibited. Because the role is generic, the [`aria-roledescription`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-roledescription) and [`aria-brailleroledescription`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-brailleroledescription) attributes are also prohibited.

> [!NOTE]
> The element with `role="generic"` should not have an accessible name or role description.

### Associated WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties

None. If a global ARIA state and property is set, `generic` or `none` will be ignored, and the implicit role of the element will be used.

## Examples

This role is for use by user agents and not by developers. As such, no appropriate example exists.

# ARIA: grid role

The grid role is for a widget that contains one or more rows of cells. The position of each cell is significant and can be focused using keyboard input.

## Description

The `grid` role is a composite widget containing a collection of one or more rows with one or more cells where some or all cells in the grid are focusable by using methods of two-dimensional navigation, such as directional arrow keys.

```html
<table role="grid" aria-labelledby="id-select-your-seat">
  <caption id="id-select-your-seat">
    Select your seat
  </caption>
  <tbody role="presentation">
    <tr role="presentation">
      <td></td>
      <th>Row A</th>
      <th>Row B</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Aisle 1</th>
      <td tabindex="0">
        <button id="1a" tabindex="-1">1A</button>
      </td>
      <td tabindex="-1">
        <button id="1b" tabindex="-1">1B</button>
      </td>
      <!-- More Columns -->
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Aisle 2</th>
      <td tabindex="-1">
        <button id="2a" tabindex="-1">2A</button>
      </td>
      <td tabindex="-1">
        <button id="2b" tabindex="-1">2B</button>
      </td>
      <!-- More Columns -->
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

A grid widget contains one or more rows with one or more cells of thematically related interactive content. While it does not imply a specific visual presentation, it implies a relationship among elements. Uses fall into two categories: presenting tabular information (data grids) and grouping other widgets (layout grids). Even though both data grids and layout grids employ the same ARIA roles, states, and properties, differences in their content and purpose surface factors that are important to consider in keyboard interaction design. See [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/grid/) for more details.

Cell elements have the role [`gridcell`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/gridcell_role), unless they are a row or column header, in which case, the elements are [`rowheader`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/rowheader_role) and [`columnheader`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/columnheader_role), respectively. Cell elements need to be owned by elements with a [`row`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/row_role) role. Rows can be grouped using the [`rowgroup`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/rowgroup_role) role.

If the grid is used as an interactive widget, [keyboard interactions](#keyboard_interactions) need to be implemented.

### Associated ARIA roles, states, and properties

#### Roles

- [treegrid](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/treegrid_role) (subclass)
  - : If a grid has columns that can expanded or collapsed, a treegrid can be used.
- [row](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/row_role)
  - : A row inside the grid.
- [rowgroup](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/rowgroup_role)
  - : A group containing one or multiple [row](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/row_role)s.

#### States and properties

- [aria-level](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-level)
  - : Indicates the hierarchical level of the grid within other structures.
- [aria-multiselectable](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-multiselectable)
  - : If `aria-multiselectable` is set to `true`, multiple items in the grid can be selected. The default value is `false`.
- [aria-readonly](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-readonly)
  - : If the user can navigate the grid but not change the value or values of the grid, the [`aria-readonly`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-readonly) should be set to `true`. The default value is `false`.

> [!NOTE]
> For many use cases, an HTML {{HTMLElement('table')}} element is sufficient as it and the various table elements already include many ARIA roles.

### Keyboard interactions

When a keyboard user encounters a grid, they navigate the rows and columns using the <kbd>left</kbd>, <kbd>right</kbd>, <kbd>top</kbd> and <kbd>down</kbd> keys. To activate the interactive component, they will use the <kbd>return</kbd> and <kbd>space</kbd> keys.

| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <kbd>→</kbd>                      | Moves focus one cell to the right. Optionally (layout grids), if focus is on the right-most cell in the row, focus may move to the first cell in the following row. If focus is on the last cell in the grid, focus does not move.    |
| <kbd>←</kbd>                      | Moves focus one cell to the left. Optionally (layout grids), if focus is on the left-most cell in the row, focus may move to the last cell in the previous row. If focus is on the first cell in the grid, focus does not move.       |
| <kbd>↓</kbd>                      | Moves focus one cell down. Optionally (layout grids), if focus is on the bottom cell in the column, focus may move to the top cell in the following column. If focus is on the last cell in the grid, focus does not move.            |
| <kbd>↑</kbd>                      | Moves focus one cell up. Optionally (layout grids), if focus is on the top cell in the column, focus may move to the bottom cell in the previous column. If focus is on the first cell in the grid, focus does not move.              |
| <kbd>Page Down</kbd>              | Moves focus down an author-determined number of rows, typically scrolling so the bottom row in the currently visible set of rows becomes one of the first visible rows. If focus is in the last row of the grid, focus does not move. |
| <kbd>Page Up</kbd>                | Moves focus up an author-determined number of rows, typically scrolling so the top row in the currently visible set of rows becomes one of the last visible rows. If focus is in the first row of the grid, focus does not move.      |

# ARIA: gridcell role

The `gridcell` role is used to make a cell in a [grid](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/grid_role) or [treegrid](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/treegrid_role). It is intended to mimic the functionality of the HTML {{HTMLElement('td')}} element for table-style grouping of information.

```html
<div role="gridcell">Potato</div>
<div role="gridcell">Cabbage</div>
<div role="gridcell">Onion</div>
```

Elements that have `role="gridcell"` applied to them must be the child of an element with a role of [`row`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/row_role).

```html
<div role="row">
  <div role="gridcell">Jane</div>
  <div role="gridcell">Smith</div>
  <div role="gridcell">496-619-5098</div>
  …
</div>
```

The first rule of ARIA is if a native HTML element or attribute has the semantics and behavior you require, use it instead of re-purposing an element and adding ARIA. Instead use the HTML {{HTMLElement('td')}} element:

```html
<td>Potato</td>
<td>Cabbage</td>
<td>Onion</td>
```

## Description

### gridcells with dynamically added, hidden, or removed rows and columns

Any element with a `role="gridcell"` applied to it should use ARIA to describe its order in the table-style grouping, provided the table, grid, or treegrid has the ability to have rows and/or columns dynamically added, hidden, or removed.

Use [`aria-colindex`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-colindex) to describe a `gridcell`'s order in the list of columns, and [`aria-rowindex`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-rowindex) to describe a gridcell's order in the list of rows. Use [`aria-colcount`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-colcount) and [`aria-rowcount`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-rowcount) on the parent element with [`role="grid"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/grid_role) applied to it to set the total number of columns or rows.

This sample code demonstrates a table-style grouping of information where the third and fourth columns have been removed. [`aria-colindex`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-colindex) is being used to describe the rows' position and allows a person using assistive technology to infer that certain rows have been removed:

```html
<div role="grid" aria-colcount="6">
  <div role="rowgroup">
    <div role="row">
      <div role="columnheader" aria-colindex="1">First name</div>
      <div role="columnheader" aria-colindex="2">Last name</div>
      <div role="columnheader" aria-colindex="5">City</div>
      <div role="columnheader" aria-colindex="6">Zip</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div role="rowgroup">
    <div role="row">
      <div role="gridcell" aria-colindex="1">Debra</div>
      <div role="gridcell" aria-colindex="2">Burks</div>
      <div role="gridcell" aria-colindex="5">New York</div>
      <div role="gridcell" aria-colindex="6">14127</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  …
</div>
```

### Describing the position of gridcells when the overall structure is unknown

In situations where the table-style grouping of content does not provide information about the columns and rows, gridcells must have their positions programmatically described by using [`aria-describedby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-describedby). The [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/id)s provided for `aria-describedby` should correspond to parent elements intended to be the rows and columns.

By referencing the parent elements with roles of [`rowheader`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/rowheader_role) or [`columnheader`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/columnheader_role) applied to them via `aria-describedby`, it allows assistive technology to understand the position and relationship of the `gridcell` element to the rest of the table-style grouping of content.

### Interactive grids and treegrids

#### Editable cells

Both `<td>` elements and elements with a role of `gridcell` applied to them can be made editable, mimicking functionality similar to editing a spreadsheet. This is done by applying the HTML [`contenteditable` attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/contenteditable).

```html
<td contenteditable="true">Notes</td>

<div role="gridcell" contenteditable="true">Item cost</div>
```

`contenteditable` will make the element it is applied to focusable via the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key. If a gridcell is conditionally toggled into a state where editing is prohibited, toggle [`aria-readonly`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-readonly) on the gridcell element.

#### Expandable cells

In a [treegrid](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/treegrid_role), gridcells may be made expandable by toggling the [`aria-expanded`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-expanded) attribute. Note that if this attribute is provided, it applies only to the individual gridcell.

### Associated WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties

- `grid`
  - : Communicates that a parent element is a table or tree style grouping of information.
- `row`
  - : Required to communicate the `gridcell` is part of a row of a table-style grouping of information.
- `columnheader`
  - : Specifies which element is the associated column header.
- [`aria-colindex`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-colindex)
  - : Identifies the position of an element in relation to the rest of the table-style grouping of information's columns.
- `rowheader`
  - : Specifies which element is the associated row header.
- [`aria-rowindex`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-rowindex)
  - : Identifies the position of an element in relation to the rest of the table-style grouping of information's rows.

### Examples

The following example creates a table-style grouping of information:

```html
<h3 id="table-title">Jovian gas giant planets</h3>
<div role="grid" aria-describedby="table-title">
  <div role="rowgroup">
    <div role="row">
      <div role="columnheader">Name</div>
      <div role="columnheader">Diameter (km)</div>
      <div role="columnheader">Length of day (hours)</div>
      <div role="columnheader">Distance from Sun (10<sup>6</sup>km)</div>
      <div role="columnheader">Number of moons</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div role="rowgroup">
    <div role="row">
      <div role="gridcell">Jupiter</div>
      <div role="gridcell">142,984</div>
      <div role="gridcell">9.9</div>
      <div role="gridcell">778.6</div>
      <div role="gridcell">67</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div role="rowgroup">
    <div role="row">
      <div role="gridcell">Saturn</div>
      <div role="gridcell">120,536</div>
      <div role="gridcell">10.7</div>
      <div role="gridcell">1433.5</div>
      <div role="gridcell">62</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Accessibility concerns

Support for `gridcell` and certain `gridcell` related ARIA roles and properties have poor support with assistive technologies. If at all possible, use [HTML table markup](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/table) in their place.

## Best practices

The first rule of ARIA is: if a native HTML element or attribute has the semantics and behavior you require, use it instead of re-purposing an element and adding an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible. As such, it is recommended to use [native HTML table markup](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/table) instead of recreating a table's form and functionality with ARIA and JavaScript.

# ARIA: group role

The `group` role identifies a set of user interface objects that is not intended to be included in a page summary or table of contents by assistive technologies.

## Description

Most closely related to HTML's {{HTMLElement('fieldset')}} element, the `group` document structure role is used to identify a set of user interface objects which, as compared to [`region`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/region_role), is not intended to be included in the page's summary or table of contents.

The `group` role should be used to form a logical collection of items with related functionality, such as children in a [`tree`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tree_role) widget forming a collection of siblings in a hierarchy, or a collection of items having the same container in a [`directory`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/directory_role).

When a `group` is used in the context of [`list`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/list_role), limit the children of the `group` to [`listitem`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/listitem_role) elements. In this case, it is recommended to use multiple ordered or unordered lists, {{HTMLElement('ol')}} or {{HTMLElement('ul')}}, with nested {{HTMLElement('li')}} children.

When used in the context of a [`listbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/listbox_role), the only children allowed are {{HTMLElement('option')}} elements. In this case, it is recommended to use {{HTMLElement('select')}}, {{HTMLElement('option')}} and {{HTMLElement('optgroup')}} instead.

`Group` elements may be nested.

The `group` role should not be used for major perceivable sections of a page. If a section is significant enough that it should be included in the page's table of contents, use the `region` role or a standard [landmark role](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles#3._landmark_roles).

When the role is added to an element, the browser will send out an accessible group event to assistive technology products, which can then notify the user about it.

## Examples

The HTML code example below uses the `group` role with a `tree` view:

```html
<div id="tree1" role="tree" tabindex="-1">
  <div
    id="animals"
    class="groupHeader"
    role="presentation"
    aria-owns="animalGroup"
    aria-expanded="true">
    <img role="presentation" tabindex="-1" src="images/treeExpanded.gif" />
    <span role="treeitem" tabindex="0">Animals</span>
  </div>
  <div id="animalGroup" role="group">
    <div id="birds" role="treeitem">
      <span tabindex="-1">Birds</span>
    </div>
    <div
      id="cats"
      class="groupHeader"
      role="presentation"
      aria-owns="catGroup"
      aria-expanded="false">
      <img role="presentation" tabindex="-1" src="images/treeContracted.gif" />
      <span role="treeitem" tabindex="0">Cats</span>
    </div>
    <div id="catGroup" role="group">
      <div id="siamese" role="treeitem">
        <span tabindex="-1">Siamese</span>
      </div>
      <div id="tabby" role="treeitem">
        <span tabindex="-1">Tabby</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

The following example uses the `group` role with a drop-down [`menu`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menu_role) containing [`menuitem`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitem_role)s:

```html
<div role="menu">
  <ul role="group">
    <li role="menuitem">Inbox</li>
    <li role="menuitem">Archive</li>
    <li role="menuitem">Trash</li>
  </ul>
  <ul role="group">
    <li role="menuitem">Custom Folder 1</li>
    <li role="menuitem">Custom Folder 2</li>
    <li role="menuitem">Custom Folder 3</li>
  </ul>
  <ul role="group">
    <li role="menuitem">New Folder</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

This menu could be constructed using {{HTMLElement('select')}} and {{HTMLElement('option')}} elements. In this case, the `group` role would be most similar to the {{HTMLElement('optgroup')}} element.

# ARIA: heading role

The `heading` role defines this element as a heading to a page or section, with the [`aria-level`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-level) attribute providing for more structure.

## Description

The heading role indicates to assistive technologies that this element should be treated like a heading. Screen readers would read the text and indicate that it is formatted like a heading. In addition, the level tells assistive technologies which part of the page structure this heading represents. A level 1 heading, indicated with `aria-level="1"`, usually indicates the main heading of a page, a level 2 heading, defined with `aria-level="2"` the first subsection, a level 3 is a subsection of that, and so on.

```html
<div role="heading" aria-level="1">This is a main page heading</div>
```

This defines the text in the `<div>` to be the main heading of the page, indicated by being level 1 via the `aria-level` attribute. Opt for using the {{HTMLElement("Heading_Elements", "h1")}} (through {{HTMLElement("Heading_Elements", "h6")}}) element instead.

```html
<h1>This is a main page heading</h1>
```

### Associated WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties

- [`aria-level`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-level)
  - : The `aria-level` attribute specifies the heading level in the document structure. This attribute is required: authors must indicate the proper nesting level to ensure elements with a `role` of `heading` are organized into a logical outline. If the attribute is erroneously unspecified, then browsers will use a [fallback value of 2](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#authorErrorDefaultValuesTable).

### Keyboard interactions

This role does not require any special keyboard navigation. As with any heading, giving it an ID ensures it can be referenced from anchor links, making it accessible via the keyboard.

### Required JavaScript features

- Required event handlers
  - : None.
- Changing attribute values
  - : Usually not required, unless dynamically inserting content. In that case, the newly-added headings need `aria-level` attributes whose values are consistent with the rest of the document structure.

> [!NOTE]
> Instead of using a `<div>` or `<span>` with a `heading` role and `aria-level`, consider using a native {{HTMLElement("Heading_Elements", "h1")}} through {{HTMLElement("Heading_Elements", "h6")}} elements instead to indicate that this text is a heading, and what part of the structure it represents.

## Examples

The following shows a typical page structure.

```html
<div id="container">
  <div role="heading" aria-level="1">The main page heading</div>
  <p>This article is about showing a page structure.</p>
  <div role="heading" aria-level="2">Introduction</div>
  <p>An introductory text.</p>
  <div role="heading" aria-level="2">Chapter 1</div>
  <p>Text</p>
  <div role="heading" aria-level="3">Chapter 1.1</div>
  <p>More text in a sub section.</p>
</div>
```

However, instead, you should do:

```html
<div id="container">
  <h1>The main page heading</h1>
  <p>This article is about showing a page structure.</p>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>An introductory text.</p>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p>Text</p>
  <h3>Chapter 1.1</h3>
  <p>More text in a sub section.</p>
</div>
```

## Accessibility concerns

> [!WARNING]
> Using [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) or [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) will hide the content of your heading from assistive technologies, reading the label instead of the heading.

If you must use the `heading` role and [`aria-level`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-level) attribute, do not go over level 6 so that you are consistent with HTML. Although theoretically you can go higher, and some screen readers may support it, the results can be unpredictable with other browser and screen reader combinations.

## Best practices

The best way to use this role is to **not use it at all**, and instead use the native heading tags {{HTMLElement("Heading_Elements", "h1")}} through {{HTMLElement("Heading_Elements", "h6")}} as shown in the example above. The `heading` role and `aria-level` attribute should only be used to retrofit accessibility on legacy code that you cannot make major changes to.

Instead of using the ARIA `heading` role, use the semantic HTML element:

| HTML Element                              | `heading` role                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| {{HTMLElement("Heading_Elements", "h1")}} | `<div role="heading" aria-level="1">` |
| {{HTMLElement("Heading_Elements", "h2")}} | `<div role="heading" aria-level="2">` |
| {{HTMLElement("Heading_Elements", "h3")}} | `<div role="heading" aria-level="3">` |
| {{HTMLElement("Heading_Elements", "h4")}} | `<div role="heading" aria-level="4">` |
| {{HTMLElement("Heading_Elements", "h5")}} | `<div role="heading" aria-level="5">` |
| {{HTMLElement("Heading_Elements", "h6")}} | `<div role="heading" aria-level="6">` |

### Added benefits

None.

## Precedence order

The heading role overrides the native semantic meaning of the element it is being used for. The `aria-level` attribute, in addition, determines what level of heading is being exposed.

# ARIA: img role

The ARIA `img` role can be used to identify multiple elements inside page content that should be considered as a single image. These elements could be images, code snippets, text, emojis, or other content that can be combined to deliver information in a visual manner.

```html
<div role="img" aria-label="Description of the overall image">
  <img src="graphic1.png" alt="" />
  <img src="graphic2.png" />
</div>
```

## Description

Any set of content that should be consumed as a single image (which could include images, video, audio, code snippets, emojis, or other content) can be identified using `role="img"`.

You shouldn't count on the alt text of individual images for conveying context to assistive technologies; most screen readers will consider the element with `role="img"` set on it to be like a black box, and not access the individual elements inside it. Therefore, provide a comprehensive overall descriptive alt text for image, either in the surrounding text, or by using an [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) attribute, with `alt` attributes for search engines or sighted users to be written to the page should an image fail:

```html
<div role="img" aria-label="Description of the overall image">
  <img src="graphic1.png" alt="alternative text" />
  <img src="graphic2.png" alt="in case the images don't load" />
</div>
```

If you wish to add a caption or label to your image that is visible on the page, you can do using:

- [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) when the text is a concise label.
- [`aria-describedby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-describedby) when the text is a longer description.

For example:

```html
<div role="img" aria-labelledby="image-1">
  …
  <p id="image-1">Text that describes the group of images.</p>
</div>
```

If an image is purely presentational, consider using the [`presentation`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/presentation_role) role.

### SVG and role="img"

If you are using embedded SVG images in your page, it is a good idea to set `role="img"` on the outer {{SVGElement('svg')}} element and give it a label. This will cause screen readers to just consider it as a single entity and describe it using the label, rather than trying to read out all the child nodes:

```html
<svg role="img" aria-label="Description of your SVG image">
  <!-- contents of the SVG image -->
</svg>
```

### Using role="img" to confer meaning that is obscured or implied

In certain cases, assistive technology users won't be able to get the meaning of content expressed in certain ways, through certain media, or implied in certain ways. This is obvious to fix in the case of images (you can use the `alt` attribute), but in the case of mixed or other certain types of content it is not so obvious, and `role="img"` can come into play.

For example, if you use emojis in your text, the meaning might be obvious to a sighted user, but someone using a screen reader might get confused because the emojis might have either no text representation at all, or the alternative text might be confusing and not match the context it is being used in. For example, take the following code:

```html
<div role="img" aria-label="That cat is so cute">
  <p>&#x1F408; &#x1F602;</p>
</div>
```

`&#x1F408; &#x1F602;`, 🐈 and 😂, are entity references for emojis read out as "Cat" and "Face with tears of joy", but this doesn't necessarily make sense — the implied meaning is possibly more like "That cat is so cute", so we include that in an `aria-label` along with `role="img"`.

This seems to work OK across some browser/screen reader combinations, but some of them end up reading the label out twice. Use with caution and test thoroughly.

Another example where this might be suitable is when using {{Glossary("ASCII")}} emoji combinations, like the legendary "Table flip":

```html
<div role="img" aria-label="Table flip">
  <p>(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻</p>
</div>
```

If `aria-labelledby` were used, the screen reader would read it. In this case, only the contents of the `aria-label` are announced to screen reader users, hiding the gibberish of the characters without the need for descendant ARIA to hide things, but also hiding potential content that may be part of the image.

### All descendants are presentational

There are some types of user interface components that, when represented in a platform accessibility API, can only contain text. Accessibility APIs do not have a way of representing semantic elements contained in an `img`. To deal with this limitation, browsers, automatically apply role [`presentation`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/presentation_role) to all descendant elements of any `img` element as it is a role that does not support semantic children.

For example, consider the following `img` element, which contains a heading.

```html
<div role="img"><h3>Title of my image</h3></div>
```

Because descendants of `img` are presentational, the following code is equivalent:

```html
<div role="img"><h3 role="presentation">Title of my image</h3></div>
```

From the assistive technology user's perspective, the heading does not exist since the previous code snippets are equivalent to the following in the [accessibility tree](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessibility_tree).:

```html
<div role="img">Title of my image</div>
```

### Associated WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties

- `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`
  - : An accessible name is required. For the HTML {{HTMLElement('img')}} element, use the `alt` attribute. For all other elements with the `img` role, use `aria-labelledby` if a visible label is present, otherwise use `aria-label`.

## Examples

```html
<span role="img" aria-label="Rating: 4 out of 5 stars">
  <span>★</span>
  <span>★</span>
  <span>★</span>
  <span>★</span>
  <span>☆</span>
</span>
```

# WAI-ARIA Roles

ARIA roles provide semantic meaning to content, allowing screen readers and other tools to present and support interaction with an object in a way that is consistent with user expectations of that type of object. <abbr>ARIA</abbr> roles can be used to describe elements that don't natively exist in HTML or exist but don't yet have full browser support.

By default, many semantic elements in HTML have a role; for example, `<input type="radio">` has the "radio" role. Non-semantic elements in HTML do not have a role; `<div>` and `<span>` without added semantics return `null`. The `role` attribute can provide semantics.

ARIA roles are added to HTML elements using `role="role type"`, where _role type_ is the name of a role in the ARIA specification. Some roles require the inclusion of associated ARIA states or properties; others are only valid in association with other roles.

For example, `<ul role="tabpanel">` will be announced as a 'tab panel' by screen readers. However, if the tab panel doesn't have nested tabs, the element with the tabpanel role is not in fact a tab panel and accessibility has actually been negatively impacted.

The [ARIA states and properties](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes) associated with each role are included in the role's pages, with each attribute also having a dedicated page.

## ARIA role types

There are 6 categories of ARIA roles:

### 1. Document structure roles

Document Structure roles are used to provide a structural description for a section of content. Most of these roles should no longer be used as browsers now support semantic HTML elements with the same meaning. The roles without HTML equivalents, such as presentation, toolbar and tooltip roles, provide information on the document structure to assistive technologies such as screen readers as equivalent native HTML tags are not available.

- [`toolbar`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/toolbar_role)
- [`tooltip`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tooltip_role)
- [`feed`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/feed_role)
- [`math`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/math_role)
- [`presentation`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/presentation_role) / [`none`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/none_role)
- [`note`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/note_role)

For most document structure roles, semantic HTML equivalent elements are available and supported. Avoid using:

- [`application`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/application_role)
- [`article`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/article_role) (use {{HTMLElement('article')}})
- [`cell`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/cell_role) (use {{HTMLElement('td')}})
- [`columnheader`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/columnheader_role) (use `{{HTMLElement('th', '&lt;th scope="col">')}}`)
- [`definition`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/definition_role) (use {{HTMLElement('dfn')}})
- [`directory`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/directory_role)
- [`document`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/document_role)
- [`figure`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/figure_role) (use {{HTMLElement('figure')}} instead)
- [`group`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/group_role)
- [`heading`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/heading_role) (use {{HTMLElement("Heading_Elements", "h1")}} through {{HTMLElement("Heading_Elements", "h6")}})
- [`img`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/img_role) (use {{HTMLElement('img')}} or {{HTMLElement('picture')}} instead)
- [`list`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/list_role) (use either {{HTMLElement('ul')}} or {{HTMLElement('ol')}} instead)
- [`listitem`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/listitem_role) (use {{HTMLElement('li')}} instead)
- [`meter`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/meter_role) (use {{HTMLElement('meter')}} instead)
- [`row`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/row_role) (use the {{HTMLElement('tr')}} with {{HTMLElement('table')}})
- [`rowgroup`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/rowgroup_role) (use {{HTMLElement('thead')}}, {{HTMLElement('tfoot')}} and {{HTMLElement('tbody')}})
- [`rowheader`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/rowheader_role) (use `{{HTMLElement('th','&lt;th scope="row">')}}`)
- [`separator`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/separator_role) (use {{HTMLElement('hr')}} if it doesn't have focus)
- [`table`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/table_role) (use {{HTMLElement('table')}})
- [`term`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/term_role) (use {{HTMLElement('dfn')}})

These are included for completeness, but in most cases are rarely, if ever, useful:

- [`associationlist`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/structural_roles)
- [`associationlistitemkey`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/structural_roles)
- [`associationlistitemvalue`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/structural_roles)
- [`blockquote`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/structural_roles)

- [`superscript`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/structural_roles)
- [`time`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/structural_roles)

### 2. Widget roles

Widget roles are used to define common interactive patterns. Like document structure roles, some widget roles have the same semantics as well-supported native HTML elements, and therefore should be avoided. The key difference is that widget roles typically require JavaScript for interaction, while document structure roles often do not.

- [`scrollbar`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/scrollbar_role)
- [`searchbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/searchbox_role)
- [`separator`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/separator_role) (when focusable)
- [`slider`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/slider_role)
- [`spinbutton`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/spinbutton_role)
- [`switch`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/switch_role)
- [`tab`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tab_role)
- [`tabpanel`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tabpanel_role)
- [`treeitem`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/treeitem_role)

Avoid using [`button`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/button_role), [`checkbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/checkbox_role), [`gridcell`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/gridcell_role), [`link`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/link_role), [`menuitem`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitem_role), [`menuitemcheckbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitemcheckbox_role), [`menuitemradio`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitemradio_role), [`option`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/option_role), [`progressbar`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/progressbar_role), [`radio`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/radio_role), and [`textbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/textbox_role), which we've included for completeness. For most, semantic equivalents with accessible interactivity are available and supported. See the individual role documentation for more information.

#### Composite widget roles

- [`combobox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/combobox_role)
- [`menu`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menu_role)
- [`menubar`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menubar_role)
- [`tablist`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tablist_role)
- [`tree`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tree_role)
- [`treegrid`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/treegrid_role)

Avoid using [`grid`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/grid_role), [`listbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/listbox_role), and [`radiogroup`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/radio_role), which we've included for completeness. See the individual role documentation for more information.

Note that there is also a widget role (`role="widget"`), which is an abstract role and not in the widget role category.

### 3. Landmark roles

Landmark roles provide a way to identify the organization and structure of a web page. By classifying and labeling sections of a page, structural information conveyed visually through layout is represented programmatically. Screen readers use landmark roles to provide keyboard navigation to important sections of a page. Use these sparingly. Too many landmark roles create "noise" in screen readers, making it difficult to understand the overall layout of the page.

- [`banner`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/banner_role) (document {{HTMLElement('header')}})
- [`complementary`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/complementary_role) ({{HTMLElement('aside')}})

### 4. Live region roles

Live Region roles are used to define elements with content that will be dynamically changed. Sighted users can see dynamic changes when they are visually noticeable. These roles help low vision and blind users know if content has been updated. Assistive technologies, like screen readers, can be made to announce dynamic content changes:

- [`alert`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/alert_role)
- [`log`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/log_role)
- [`marquee`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/marquee_role)
- [`status`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/status_role)
- [`timer`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/timer_role)

### 5. Window roles

Window roles define sub-windows to the main document window, within the same window, such as pop up modal dialogs:

- [`alertdialog`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/alertdialog_role)
- [`dialog`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/dialog_role)

### 6. Abstract roles

Abstract roles are only intended for use by browsers to help organize and streamline a document. They should not be used by developers writing HTML markup. Doing so will not result in any meaningful information being conveyed to assistive technologies or to users.

Avoid using [`command`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/command_role), [`composite`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/composite_role), [`input`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/input_role), [`landmark`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/landmark_role), [`range`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/range_role), [`roletype`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/roletype_role), [`section`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/section_role), [`sectionhead`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/sectionhead_role), [`select`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/select_role), [`structure`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/structure_role), [`widget`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/widget_role), and [`window`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/window_role).

# ARIA: input role

The `input` abstract role is a generic type of widget that allows user input.

> [!WARNING]
> The `input` role is an [abstract role](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles#6._abstract_roles). It is included here for completeness of documentation. It is not to be used by web authors.

## Description

The `input` role is an abstract role. It must not be used by web authors. It is the superclass for input widgets that provide for user input, including [`checkbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/checkbox_role), [`radio`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/radio_role), and [`textbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/textbox_role). For all three, consider using the {{HTMLElement("input")}} element of type [`checkbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/checkbox), [`radio`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/radio) and [`text`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/text), respectively.

# ARIA: landmark role

A landmark is an important subsection of a page. The `landmark` role is an abstract superclass for the aria role values for sections of content that are important enough that users will likely want to be able to navigate directly to them.

> [!NOTE]
> The `landmark` role is an [abstract role](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles#6._abstract_roles). It is included here for completeness of documentation. It should not be used by web authors.

## Description

A `landmark` is an abstract role for a section of content that is important enough that users will likely want to be able to navigate to the section easily and have it included in a dynamically generated summary of the page. Landmarks allow assistive technologies to navigate and to find content quickly.

To create a landmark role, define the purpose of the content by using a semantic element such as `<section>`, `<nav>`, or `<main>`, or adding an ARIA role that is a subclass of the `landmark` role such as [`role="banner"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/banner_role), [`role="complementary"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/complementary_role), or [`role="region"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/region_role). Do not use `role="landmark"`.

Every concrete landmark role has its corresponding HTML semantic element:

| ARIA Role                                                                                | HTML Element               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| [`banner`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/banner_role)               | {{HTMLElement('header')}}  |
| [`complementary`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/complementary_role) | {{HTMLElement('aside')}}   |
| [`contentinfo`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/contentinfo_role)     | {{HTMLElement('footer')}}  |
| [`form`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/form_role)                   | {{HTMLElement('form')}}    |
| [`main`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/main_role)                   | {{HTMLElement('main')}}    |
| [`navigation`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/navigation_role)       | {{HTMLElement('nav')}}     |
| [`region`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/region_role)               | {{HTMLElement('section')}} |
| [`search`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/search_role)               | {{HTMLElement('search')}}  |

A visible label should be provided, referenced with [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby). If necessary, brief, descriptive, label can be provided with [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label).

For screen reader users, adding landmark roles effectively creates 'skip links' for screen reader users, but don't replace in page navigation as the landmark roles are not otherwise surfaced.

## Best practices

Do not use `role="landmark"`; rather, use subclass landmark roles as appropriate, or semantic HTML if possible. Although no longer necessary, it is considered good practice to redundantly include the subclass landmark roles with the associated semantic element for legacy browsers. This is preferable to using landmark roles on non-semantic elements, such as {{HTMLElement('div')}}, but do use at least one of `role` or semantic elements for creating landmarks. Otherwise, your content will be less navigable for screen reader users.

# ARIA: link role

A `link` widget provides an interactive reference to a resource. The target resource can be either external or local; i.e., either outside or within the current page or application.

> [!NOTE]
> Where possible, it is recommended that you use a native {{HTMLElement("a")}} element rather than the `link` role, as native elements are more widely supported by user agents and assistive technology. Native {{HTMLElement("a")}} elements also support keyboard and focus requirements by default, without need for additional customization.

## Description

The `link` role is used to identify an element that creates a hyperlink to a resource that is in the application or external.

When not using semantic HTML for its intended purpose, interactive features must be re-implemented. For example, when `role="link"` is added to an element, the <kbd>tab</kbd> key should enable giving focus to the link and the <kbd>enter</kbd> key should execute the link when focused.

Use the [`tabindex`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/tabindex) attribute with a value of `0` to ensure the link is in the correct tab focus order.

> [!WARNING]
> Applying the `link` role to an element will not cause browsers to enhance the element with standard link appearance or behaviors, such as underlining, focus rings, navigation to the link target, or context menu actions. That's the developer's responsibility.

## Examples

To recreate an accessible link using the `link` role on an element that is not an {{HTMLElement('a')}}, you need to ensure the link receives focus in the correct tab order, that the element looks like a link, and that the "link" behaves like a link.

```html
<span data-href="https://mozilla.org" tabindex="0" role="link">
  Fake accessible link created using a span
</span>
```

### CSS

```css
span[role="link"] {
  color: blue;
  text-decoration: underline;
  cursor: pointer;
}
span[role="link"]:hover,
span[role="link"]:active,
span[role="link"]:focus {
  color: purple;
}

span[role="link"]:focus {
  background-color: palegoldenrod;
  outline: 1px dotted;
}
```

### JavaScript

```js
const fakeLinks = document.querySelectorAll('[role="link"]');

for (const link of fakeLinks) {
  link.addEventListener("click", navigateLink);
  link.addEventListener("keydown", navigateLink);
}

// handles click and keydown events on the link
function navigateLink(e) {
  if (e.type === "click" || e.key === "Enter") {
    const ref = e.target ?? e.srcElement;
    if (ref) {
      window.open(ref.getAttribute("data-href"), "_blank");
    }
  }
}
```

If the element with `role="link"` receives an <kbd>Enter</kbd> key event, this executes the link, going to the linked page or moving focus to the in page target.

Optionally, <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F10</kbd> opens a context menu for the link.

## Best practices

The various widget roles are used to define common interactive patterns. Similar to the document-structure roles, some of these roles, including the `link` role, duplicate the semantics of native HTML elements that are well supported, and should not be used.

Avoid using `link`, which we've included for completeness. The {{HTMLElement('a')}} semantic equivalent with accessible interactivity is available and supported.

### Prefer HTML

Using the {{HTMLElement('a')}} instead.

> [!NOTE]
> There is no need to include `role="link"` on an HTML link as the `<a>`, by default, has that role already.

# ARIA: list role

The ARIA `list` role can be used to identify a list of items. It is normally used in conjunction with the `listitem` role, which is used to identify a list item contained inside the list.

```html
<div role="list">
  <div role="listitem">List item 1</div>
  <div role="listitem">List item 2</div>
  <div role="listitem">List item 3</div>
</div>
```

## Description

Any content that consists of an outer container with a list of elements inside can be identified to assistive technologies using the `list` and `listitem` containers, respectively. A `list` can only contain zero or more `listitem` children.

There are no hard and fast rules about which elements you should use to mark up the list and list items, but you should make sure that the list items make sense in the context of a list, e.g., a shopping list, recipe steps, driving directions.

> [!NOTE]
> Best practices dictate using the appropriate semantic HTML elements over ARIA roles to mark up lists and listitems — {{HTMLElement("ul")}}, {{HTMLElement("ol")}} and {{HTMLElement("li")}}. See [Best practices](#best_practices) for a full example.

### Associated WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties

- [`listitem`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/listitem_role) role
  - : A single item in a list. Elements with role `listitem` can only be found in an element with the role `list`.

## Best practices

Only use `role="list"` and `role="listitem"` if you have to — for example if you don't have control over your HTML but are able to improve accessibility dynamically after the fact with JavaScript.

Unlike the HTML {{HTMLElement("ol")}} and {{HTMLElement("ul")}}, the ARIA `list` roles doesn't distinguish between ordered and unordered lists. If at all possible, you should use the appropriate semantic HTML elements to mark up a list ({{HTMLElement("ol")}} and {{HTMLElement("ul")}}) and list items ({{HTMLElement("li")}}). For example, our above example should be rewritten as follows:

```html
<ul>
  <li>List item 1</li>
  <li>List item 2</li>
  <li>List item 3</li>
</ul>
```

or use an ordered list if the order of the list items matters:

```html
<ol>
  <li>List item 1</li>
  <li>List item 2</li>
  <li>List item 3</li>
</ol>
```

> [!NOTE]
> The ARIA `list` / `listitem` roles don't distinguish between ordered and unordered lists.

As an aside, note that if you are using the semantic HTML elements of `<ol>` or `<ul>` and apply a role of [`presentation`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/presentation_role), each child `<li>` element inherits the `presentation` role because ARIA requires the `listitem` elements to have the parent `list` element. So, the `<li>` elements are not exposed to assistive technologies, but elements contained inside of those `<li>` elements, including nested lists, are visible to assistive technologies.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are marking up a list of items that will function as a tabbed interface, you should instead use the [`tab`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tab_role), [`tabpanel`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tabpanel_role), and [`tablist`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tablist_role) roles.

# ARIA: listbox role

The `listbox` role is used for lists from which a user may select one or more items which are static and, unlike HTML {{HTMLElement('select')}} elements, may contain images.

## Description

The `listbox` role is used to identify an element that creates a list from which a user may select one or more static items, similar to the HTML {{HTMLElement('select')}} element. Unlike {{HTMLElement('select')}}, a listbox can contain images. Listboxes contain children whose role is [`option`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/option_role) or elements whose role is [`group`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/group_role) which in turn contain children whose role is `option`.

It is highly recommended using the HTML select element, or a group of radio buttons if only one item can be selected, or a group of checkboxes if multiple items can be selected, because there is a lot of keyboard interactivity to manage focus for all the descendants, and native HTML elements provide this functionality for you for free.

Elements with the role `listbox` have an implicit [`aria-orientation`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-orientation) value of `vertical`.

When a list is tabbed to, the first item in the list will be selected if nothing else already is. Up/down arrows navigate the list, and pressing Shift + Up/Down arrows will move and extend the selection. Typing one or more letters will navigate the list items (same letter goes to each item starting with that, different letters go to the first item starting with that entire string). If the current item has an associated context menu, Shift+F10 will launch that menu. If list items are checkable, Space can be used to toggle [checkboxes](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/checkbox_role). For selectable list items, Space toggles their selection, Shift+Space can be used to select contiguous items, Ctrl+Arrow moves without selecting, and Ctrl+Space can be used to select non-contiguous items. It is recommended that a checkbox, link or other method be used to select all items, and Ctrl+A could be used as a shortcut key for this.

When the listbox role is added to an element, or such an element becomes visible, screen readers announce the label and role of the listbox when it gets focus. If an option or item is focused within the list, it gets announced next, followed by an indication of the item's position with the list if the screen reader supports this. As focus moves within the list, the screen reader announces the relevant items.

### Associated ARIA roles, states, and properties

#### Associated Roles

- [`option`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/option_role) role
  - : One or more nested options are required. All selected options have [`aria-selected`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-selected) set to `true`. All options that are not selected have [`aria-selected`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-selected) set to `false`. If an option is not selectable, omit the [`aria-selected`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-selected).
- [`list`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/list_role) role
  - : A section containing `listitem` elements

#### States and Properties

- [`aria-activedescendant`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-activedescendant)
  - : Holds the `id` string of the currently active element within the listbox. If that's an option element, then that would be the `id` of the most recently interacted with option, regardless of whether that option has an [`aria-selected`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-selected) value of `true` or not. Takes the value of only one `id`, even in a multiselectable listbox. If the `id` does not refer to a DOM descendant of the listbox, then that `id` must be included among the IDs in the [`aria-owns`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-owns) attribute.
- [`aria-owns`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-owns)
  - : This is a space-separated list of element IDs which are not DOM child elements of the listbox. IDs listed here cannot also be listed in [`aria-owns`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-owns) attributes of any other elements.

- [`aria-multiselectable`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-multiselectable)
  - : Include and set to `true` if the user can select more than one option. If set to `true`, _every_ selectable option should have an [`aria-selected`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-selected) attribute included and set to `true` or `false`. Options which are _not_ selectable _should not_ have the [`aria-selected`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-selected) attribute. If `false` or omitted, only the currently selected option, if any option is selected, needs the [`aria-selected`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-selected) attribute, and it must be set to `true`.

- [`aria-required`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-required)
  - : A Boolean attribute which indicates that an option with a non-empty string value must be selected.

- [`aria-readonly`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-readonly)
  - : The user cannot change which options are selected or unselected, but the listbox is otherwise operable.

- [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label)
  - : A human-readable string value which identifies the listbox. If there's a visible label, then [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) should be used instead to refer to that label.

- [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby)
  - : Identifies the visible element or elements in a space-separated list of element IDs which identify the listbox. If there's no visible label, then [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) should be used instead to include a label. (Note: "labelled", with two L's, is the correct spelling based on the accessibility API conventions.)

- [`aria-roledescription`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-roledescription)
  - : A human-readable string value which more clearly identifies the role of the listbox. Screen readers will often read this value to the user after reading the label (if there is one), in place of saying "listbox".

### Keyboard interactions

- When a single-select listbox receives focus:
  - If none of the options are selected before the listbox receives focus, the first option receives focus. Optionally, the first option may be automatically selected.
  - If an option is selected before the listbox receives focus, focus is set on the selected option.

- When a multi-select listbox receives focus:
  - If none of the options are selected before the listbox receives focus, focus is set on the first option and there is no automatic change in the selection state.
  - If one or more options are selected before the listbox receives focus, focus is set on the first option in the list that is selected.

- <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>

  : Moves focus to the next option. Optionally, in a single-select listbox, selection may also move with focus.

- <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd>

  : Moves focus to the previous option. Optionally, in a single-select listbox, selection may also move with focus.

- <kbd>Home</kbd>

  (Optional): Moves focus to first option. Optionally, in a single-select listbox, selection may also move with focus. Supporting this key is strongly recommended for lists with more than five options.

- <kbd>End</kbd>

  (Optional): Moves focus to last option. Optionally, in a single-select listbox, selection may also move with focus. Supporting this key is strongly recommended for lists with more than five options.

- Type-ahead is recommended for all listboxes, especially those with more than seven options:
  - Type a character: focus moves to the next item with a name that starts with the typed character.
  - Type multiple characters in rapid succession: focus moves to the next item with a name that starts with the string of characters typed.

- **Multiple Selection**: Authors may implement either of two interaction models to support multiple selection: a recommended model that does not require the user to hold a modifier key, such as <kbd>Shift</kbd> or <kbd>Control</kbd>, while navigating the list or an alternative model that does require modifier keys to be held while navigating in order to avoid losing selection states.
  - Recommended selection model — holding modifier keys is not necessary:
    - <kbd>Space</kbd>: changes the selection state of the focused option.
    - <kbd>Shift + Down Arrow</kbd> (Optional): Moves focus to and toggles the selected state of the next option.
    - <kbd>Shift + Up Arrow</kbd> (Optional): Moves focus to and toggles the selected state of the previous option.
    - <kbd>Shift + Space</kbd> (Optional): Selects contiguous items from the most recently selected item to the focused item.
    - <kbd>Control + Shift + Home</kbd> (Optional): Selects the focused option and all options up to the first option. Optionally, moves focus to the first option.
    - <kbd>Control + Shift + End</kbd> (Optional): Selects the focused option and all options down to the last option. Optionally, moves focus to the last option.
    - <kbd>Control + A</kbd> (Optional): Selects all options in the list. Optionally, if all options are selected, it may also unselect all options.

### Required JavaScript features

#### selecting an option in a single select listbox

When the user selects an option, the following must occur:

1. Deselect the previously selected option, setting the [`aria-selected`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-selected) to `false`, or removing the attribute altogether, changing the appearance of the newly unselected option to appear not selected.
2. Select the newly selected option, setting `aria-selected="true"` on the option and changing the appearance of the newly selected option to appear selected.
3. Update the [`aria-activedescendant`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-activedescendant) value on the listbox to the id of the newly selected option
4. Visually handle the blur, focus, and selected states of the option

#### Toggling the state of an option in a multi select listbox

When the user clicks on an option, hits <kbd>Space</kbd> when focused on an option, or otherwise toggles the state of an option, the following must occur:

1. Toggle the [`aria-selected`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-selected) state of the currently focused option, changing the state of the `aria-selected` to true if it was false or false if it was true.
2. Change the appearance of the option to reflect its selected state
3. Update the [`aria-activedescendant`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-activedescendant) value on the listbox to the ID of the option the user just interacted with, even if they toggled the option to be unselected.

> The first rule of ARIA use is you can use a native feature with the semantics and behavior you require already built in, instead of re-purposing an element and **adding** an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible, then do so. The {{HTMLElement('select')}} element with descendant {{HTMLElement('option')}} elements handles all the needed interactions natively.

## Examples

### Example 1: A single select listbox that uses `aria-activedescendant`

The snippet below, using [`aria-activedescendant`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-activedescendant), shows how the listbox role is added directly into the HTML source code.

```html
<p id="listbox1label" role="label">Select a color:</p>
<div
  role="listbox"
  tabindex="0"
  id="listbox1"
  aria-labelledby="listbox1label"
  aria-activedescendant="listbox1-1">
  <div role="option" id="listbox1-1" class="selected" aria-selected="true">
    Green
  </div>
  <div role="option" id="listbox1-2">Orange</div>
  <div role="option" id="listbox1-3">Red</div>
  <div role="option" id="listbox1-4">Blue</div>
  <div role="option" id="listbox1-5">Violet</div>
  <div role="option" id="listbox1-6">Periwinkle</div>
</div>
```

```js
const listbox = document.getElementById("listbox1");
listbox.addEventListener("click", listItemClick);
listbox.addEventListener("keydown", listItemKeyEvent);
listbox.addEventListener("keypress", listItemKeyEvent);
```

This could have more easily been handled with the native HTML {{HTMLElement('select')}} and {{HTMLElement('label')}} elements.

```html
<label for="listbox1">Select a color:</label>
<select id="listbox1">
  <option selected>Green</option>
  <option>Orange</option>
  <option>Red</option>
  <option>Blue</option>
  <option>Violet</option>
  <option>Periwinkle</option>
</select>
```

### More examples

- [Scrollable Listbox Example](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/listbox/examples/listbox-scrollable/): Single-select listbox that scrolls to reveal more options, similar to HTML {{HTMLElement('select')}} with `size` attribute greater than one.
- [Listbox Example with Grouped Options](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/listbox/examples/listbox-grouped/): Single-select listbox with grouped options, similar to HTML {{HTMLElement('select')}} with the attribute `size` set to greater than `"1"` and options grouped with `optgroup` elements.
- [Example Listboxes with Rearrangeable Options](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/listbox/examples/listbox-rearrangeable/): Examples of both single-select and multi-select listboxes with accompanying toolbars where options can be added, moved, and removed.

## Best practices

- To be keyboard-accessible, authors should [manage focus](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#managingfocus) of all descendants of this role.
- It is recommended that authors use different styling for the selection when the list is not focused, e.g., a non-active selection is often shown with a lighter background color.
- If the listbox is not part of another widget, it should have the [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) property set.
- If one or more entries are not DOM children of listbox, additional `aria-*` properties will need to be set (see [ARIA Best Practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/listbox/)).
- If there is a valid reason to [expand](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-expanded) the listbox, the [`combobox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/combobox_role) role may be more appropriate.

# ARIA: listitem role

The ARIA `listitem` role can be used to identify an item inside a list of items. It is normally used in conjunction with the [`list`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/list_role) role, which is used to identify a list container.

```html
<section role="list">
  <div role="listitem">List item 1</div>
  <div role="listitem">List item 2</div>
  <div role="listitem">List item 3</div>
</section>
```

## Description

Any content that consists of an outer container with a list of elements inside it can be identified to assistive technologies using the `list` and `listitem` containers respectively.

There are no hard and fast rules about which elements you should use to mark up the list and list items, but you should make sure that the list items make sense in the context of a list, e.g., a shopping list, recipe steps, driving directions.

> [!NOTE]
> If at all possible in your work, you should use the appropriate semantic HTML elements to mark up a list and its listitems — {{HTMLElement("ul")}}/{{HTMLElement("ol")}} and {{HTMLElement("li")}}. See [Best practices](#best_practices) for a full example.

### Associated WAI-ARIA Roles, States, and Properties

- [`list`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/list_role)
  - : A list of items. Elements with role `list` must have one or more elements with the role `listitem` as children, a one or more elements with the role of `group` that have one or more elements with the `listitem` role as children.
- [`group`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/group_role)
  - : A collection of related objects, limited to list items when nested in a list, not important enough to have their own place in a pages table of contents.

## Best practices

Only use `role="list"` and `role="listitem"` if you have to — for example if you don't have control over your HTML but are able to improve accessibility dynamically after the fact with JavaScript.

If at all possible, you should use the appropriate semantic HTML elements to mark up a list and listitems — {{HTMLElement("ol")}}, {{HTMLElement("ul")}} and {{HTMLElement("li")}}. For example, our above example should be rewritten as follows:

```html
<ul>
  <li>List item 1</li>
  <li>List item 2</li>
  <li>List item 3</li>
</ul>
```

or use an ordered list if the order of the list items matters:

```html
<ol>
  <li>List item 1</li>
  <li>List item 2</li>
  <li>List item 3</li>
</ol>
```

> [!NOTE]
> The ARIA `list` / `listitem` roles don't distinguish between ordered and unordered lists.

> [!NOTE]
> Styling a list with `list-style: none;` in CSS removes the list semantics. Adding `role="listitem"` returns the semantics.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are marking up a list of items that will function as a tabbed interface, you should instead use the [`tab`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tab_role), [`tabpanel`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tabpanel_role), and [`tablist`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tablist_role) roles.

# ARIA: log role

The `log` role is used to identify an element that creates a [live region](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Guides/Live_regions) where new information is added in a meaningful order and old information may disappear.

## Description

A log is a type of live region where new information is added in meaningful order and old information may disappear. Examples include chat logs, messaging history, game log, or an error log. In contrast to other live regions, in this role there is a relationship between the arrival of new items in the log and the reading order. The log contains a meaningful sequence and new information is added only to the end of the log, not at arbitrary points.

In contrast to other types of live region, a log is sequentially ordered and new information is only added to the end of the log. When this role is added to an element, the browser will send out an accessible log event to assistive technology products which can then notify the user about it.

By default, updates contain only the changes to the live region and these are announced when the user is idle. Elements with the role `log` have an implicit `aria-live` value of `polite`. Where the user needs to hear the entire live region upon a change `aria-atomic="true"` should be set. To have announcements made as soon as possible and where the user may be interrupted, `aria-live="assertive"` can be set for more aggressive updates.

### Associated WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties

- [`aria-atomic`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-atomic)
  - : Defines whether assistive technologies should present all, or only parts of, the changed region. Elements with the role `log` have an implicit `aria-atomic` value of `false`.

- [`aria-live`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-live)
  - : Defines when assistive technology should inform the user of updates to content. Elements with the role `log` have an implicit `aria-live` value of `polite`, meaning screen readers will announce changes inside the log when the user is idle.

- `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby`
  - : The `log` is required to have an accessible name. Use `aria-labelledby` if a visible label is present, otherwise use `aria-label`.

## Best practices

With an area that has scrolling text, such as a stock ticker, the [`marquee`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/marquee_role) role should be used instead.

# ARIA: main role

The `main` landmark role is used to indicate the primary content of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the main function of an application.

```html
<div id="main" role="main">
  <h1>Avocados</h1>
  <!-- main section content -->
</div>
```

This is the main section of a document that discusses avocados. Subsections of this document could discuss their history, the different types, regions where they grow, etc.

## Description

The `main` role is a navigational [landmark](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles#3._landmark_roles) role identifying the main content of a document. Landmarks can be used by assistive technology such as screen readers to quickly identify and navigate to large sections of the document.

By classifying and labeling sections of a page, structural information conveyed visually through layout can be represented programmatically. Screen readers use landmark roles to provide keyboard navigation to important sections of a page. For those navigating via landmark roles, the main role is an alternative for "skip to main content" links.

There should only be one `main` landmark role per document.

The {{HTMLElement('main')}} element has a role of `main`. Developers should use semantic HTML — in this case {{HTMLElement('main')}} — over using ARIA.

### Associated ARIA roles, states, and properties

- [`aria-owns`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-owns)
  - : The `aria-owns` attribute establishes relationships in the accessibility layer that aren't present in the DOM. Documents and applications can be nested in the DOM, which may lead to having more than one main element as DOM descendants. If this is the case, include `aria-owns` to identify the relationship of the main to its document or application ancestor.

- [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) or `aria-labelledby`
  - : Identify the accessible name with [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) if a visible header is present. Otherwise, including an [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) can be helpful for orienting assistive technology users, especially in single-page applications where main content changes happen without generating a page load event.

## Example

```html
<body>
  <!-- primary navigation -->

  <div role="main">
    <h1>The First Indochina War</h1>
    <!-- article content -->
  </div>

  <!-- sidebar and footer -->
</body>
```

## Accessibility concerns

### Use only one `main` role per document

The `main` [landmark role](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles#3._landmark_roles) should only be used once per document.

If a document contains two `main` roles, say updating page content when triggered by JavaScript, the inactive `main` role's presence should be removed from assistive technology via techniques such as toggling the [`hidden` attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/hidden).

```html
<main>
  <h1>Active `main` element</h1>
  <!-- content -->
</main>

<main hidden>
  <h1>Hidden `main` element</h1>
  <!-- content -->
</main>
```

It is also helpful to include an accessible name to help orient assistive technology users, especially in single-page applications where main content changes happen without generating a page load event. This can be added with `aria-labelledby` if there is an appropriate name in the content, or `aria-label` if not.

## Best practices

### Prefer HTML

Using the {{HTMLElement('main')}} element will automatically communicate that the element has a role of `main`. If possible, prefer using the semantic `<main>` element instead of the `main` role.

### Skip navigation

Skip navigation, also known as "skipnav", is a technique that allows an assistive technology user to quickly bypass large sections of repeated content (main navigation, info banners, etc.). This allows the user to access the main content of the page faster.

Adding an [`id` attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/id) to the element with a declaration of `role="main"` allows it to be a target of a skip navigation link users.

```html
<body>
  <a href="#main-content">Skip to main content</a>

  <!-- navigation and header content -->

  <div id="main-content" role="main">
    <!-- main page content -->
  </div>
</body>
```

Which is the equivalent of:

```html
<body>
  <a href="#main-content">Skip to main content</a>

  <!-- navigation and header content -->

  <main id="main-content">
    <!-- main page content -->
  </main>
</body>
```

# ARIA: mark role

The `mark` role denotes content which is marked or highlighted for reference or notation purposes, due to the content's relevance in the enclosing context.

## Description

The `mark` role semantically denotes HTML elements containing text that is marked/highlighted for reference purposes. This is semantically equivalent to the HTML {{HTMLElement('mark')}} element. If possible, you should use this element instead.

Example uses for `mark` are the exact same as the `<mark>` element. They include highlighting text in a quotation which is of special interest but is not marked in the original source material, comparable to using a highlighter pen to mark passages of a print article and indicating portions of the content that are relevant to the user's current activity, such as highlighting text matches found by a search feature.

Don't use `mark` for purely decorative styling such as syntax highlighting.

The `mark` element should not be given an accessible name; both [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) and [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) attributes are prohibited on `mark`.

## Examples

In the following example we have a document section that has been commented. The commented section is marked up using `<span role="mark">`.

```html
<p>
  The last half of the song is a slow-rising crescendo that peaks at the
  <span role="mark" aria-details="thread-1">end of the guitar solo</span>,
  before fading away sharply.
</p>

<div role="comment" id="thread-1" data-author="chris">
  <h3>Chris said</h3>
  <p class="comment-text">I really think this moment could use more cowbell.</p>
  <p><time datetime="2022-03-30T19:29">March 30 2022, 19:29</time></p>
</div>
```

The related comment is marked up using an HTML structure wrapped with a {{HTMLElement('div')}} containing [`role="comment"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/comment_role).

To associate the comment with the text being commented, we need to wrap the commented text with an element containing the [`aria-details`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-details) attribute, the value of which should be the ID of the comment.

## Best practices

### Prefer HTML

Using the {{HTMLElement('mark')}} element will automatically communicate a node has a role of `mark`. If at all possible, prefer using it instead.

## Specifications

Will be part of [WAI-ARIA 1.3](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#mark), which is still being drafted.

# ARIA: marquee role

A `marquee` is a type of [live region](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Guides/Live_regions) containing non-essential information which changes frequently.

## Description

The `marquee` role defines an area as a type of live region that presents non-essential information that changes frequently. Examples of marquees include stock tickers and ad banners; information that is not necessarily sought out by the user that may be presented in any order. The main difference between a `marquee` and a [`log`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/log_role) is that log information is presented in a meaningful order such as a by date.

Elements with the role marquee have an implicit [aria-live](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Guides/Live_regions) value of `off`.

The marquee is required to have an accessible name. Use [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) if a visible label is present, otherwise use [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label).

### Associated WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties

- [`aria-live`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-live)
  - : Defines when assistive technology should inform the user of updates to content. Elements with the role `marquee` have an implicit `aria-live` value of `off`, meaning screen readers will not announce changes inside the marquee, even when the user is idle.

- [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) or [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby)
  - : The `marquee` is required to have an accessible name. Use `aria-labelledby` if a visible label is present, otherwise use `aria-label`.

# ARIA: math role

The `math` role indicates that the content represents a mathematical expression.

## Description

Content with the role `math` is intended to be marked up in an accessible format such as [MathML](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML), or with another type of textual representation, which can be converted to an accessible format by the browser or a polyfill library.

Unfortunately, browser support for MathML is not universal. While using an image of a mathematical expression is not optimal, if you do use image, use the `math` role.
Make sure any images of math are labeled by an `alt` attribute that describes the mathematical expression as it would be spoken.

If the math element has only presentational children and the accessible name is intended to convey the mathematical expression, use [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) to provide a string that represents the expression. If the math element contains navigable content that conveys the mathematical expression and a visible label for the expression is present, use [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby). Otherwise, use `aria-label` to name the expression, e.g., `aria-label="Pythagorean Theorem"`.

## Examples

If you use image or non-semantic HTML to create an equation, use the `math` role.

<div role="math" aria-label="a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}">
   a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>
</div>

The above pythagorean theorem is written accessibly as:

```html
<div role="math" aria-label="a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}">
  a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>
</div>
```

Had an image been used, the `alt` attribute would be used along with the `math` role:

```html
<img src="pythagorean_theorem.gif" alt="a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}" role="math" />
```

# ARIA: menu role

The `menu` role is a type of composite widget that offers a list of choices to the user.

## Description

A `menu` generally represents a grouping of common actions or functions that the user can invoke. The `menu` role is appropriate when a list of menu items is presented in a manner similar to a menu on a desktop application. Submenus, also known as pop-up menus, also have the role `menu`.

While the term "menu" is a generically used term to describe site navigation, the `menu` role is for a list of actions or functions that require complex functionality, such as composite widget focus management and first-character navigation

A menu can be a permanently visible list of controls or a widget that can be made to open and close. A closed `menu` widget is usually opened, or made visible, by activating a menu button, choosing an item in a menu that opens a submenu, or by invoking a command, such as <kbd>Shift + F10</kbd> in Windows which opens a context specific menu.

When a user activates a choice in a menu that has been opened, the menu usually closes. If the menu choice action invokes a submenu, the menu will remain open and the submenu is displayed.

When a menu opens, keyboard focus is placed on the first menu item. To be keyboard accessible, you need to [manage focus](https://usability.yale.edu/web-accessibility/articles/focus-keyboard-operability) for all descendants: all menu items within the `menu` are focusable. The menu button which opens the menu and the menu items, rather than the menu itself, are the focusable elements.

Menu items include [`menuitem`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitem_role), [`menuitemcheckbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitemcheckbox_role), and [`menuitemradio`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitemradio_role). [Disabled](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-disabled) menu items are focusable but cannot be activated.

Menu items can be grouped in elements with the [`group`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/group_role) role, and separated by elements with role [`separator`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/separator_role). Neither `group` nor `separator` receive focus or are interactive.

If a `menu` is opened as a result of a context action, <kbd>Escape</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> may return focus to the invoking context. If focus was on the menu button, <kbd>Enter</kbd> opens the menu, giving focus to the first menu item. If focus is on the menu itself, <kbd>Escape</kbd> closes the menu and returns focus to the menu button or parent menubar item (or the context action that opened the menu).

Elements with the role `menu` have an implicit [`aria-orientation`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-orientation) value of `vertical`. For horizontally oriented menu, use [`aria-orientation="horizontal"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-orientation).

If the menu is visually persistent, consider the [`menubar`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menubar_role) role instead.

### Associated WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties

- [`menuitem`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitem_role), [`menuitemcheckbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitemcheckbox_role), and [`menuitemradio`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitemradio_role) roles
  - : Roles of items contained in a containing `menu` or `menubar`, known collectively as "menu items". These must be able to receive focus.
- [`group`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/group_role) role
  - : Menu items can be nested in a [`group`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/group_role)
- [`separator`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/separator_role) role
  - : A divider that separates and distinguishes sections of content or groups of menu items within the menu

- [`tabindex`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/tabindex) attribute
  - : The `menu` container has `tabindex` set to `-1` or `0` and each item in the menu has `tabindex` set to `-1`.
- [`aria-activedescendant`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-activedescendant)
  - : Set to the ID of the focused item, if there is one.
- [`aria-orientation`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-orientation)
  - : indicates whether the menu orientation is horizontal or vertical; defaults to `vertical` if omitted.
- [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) or [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby)
  - : The `menu` is required to have an accessible name. Use `aria-labelledby` if a visible label is present, otherwise use `aria-label`. Either include the `aria-labelledby` set to a the `id` to the `menuitem` or `button` that controls its display or use `aria-label` to define the label.
- [`aria-owns`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-owns)
  - : Only set on the menu container to include elements that are not DOM children of the container. If set, those elements will appear in the reading order in the sequence they are referenced and after any items that are DOM children. When managing focus, ensure the visual focus order matches this assistive technology reading order.

### Keyboard interactions

- <kbd>Space</kbd> / <kbd>Enter</kbd>
  - : If the item is a parent menu item, it opens the submenu and moves focus to the first item in the submenu. Otherwise, activates the menu item, which loads new content and places focus on the heading that titles the content.
- <kbd>Escape</kbd>
  - : When in a submenu, it closes the submenu and moves focus to the parent menu or menubar item.
- <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd>
  - : In a menubar, moves focus to the next item in the menubar. If focus is on the last item, it moves focus to the first item. If in a submenu, if focus is on an item that does not have a submenu, it closes the submenu and moves focus to the next item in the menubar. Otherwise, it opens the submenu of the newly focused menubar item, keeping focus on that parent menubar item. If not in a menubar or submenu and not on a `menuitem` with a submenu, if focus is not the last focusable element in the menu, it optionally moves focus to the next focusable element.
- <kbd>Left Arrow </kbd>
  - : Moves focus to the previous item in the menubar. If focus is on the first item, it moves focus to the last item. If in a submenu, it closes the submenu and moves focus to the parent menu item. If not in a menubar or submenu, if focus is not the first focusable element in the menu, it optionally moves focus to the last focusable element.
- <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>
  - : Opens submenu and moves focus to the first item in the submenu.
- <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd>
  - : Opens submenu and moves focus to the last item in the submenu.
- <kbd>Home</kbd>
  - : Moves focus to the first item in the menubar.
- <kbd>End</kbd>
  - : Moves focus to the last item in the menubar.
- Any character key
  - : Moves focus to the next item in the menubar having a name that starts with the typed character. If none of the items have a name starting with the typed character, focus does not move.

## Examples

Below are two example menu implementations.

### Example 1: navigation menu

```html
<div>
  <button id="menubutton" aria-haspopup="true" aria-controls="menu">
    <img src="hamburger.svg" alt="Page Sections" />
  </button>
  <ul id="menu" role="menu" aria-labelledby="menubutton">
    <li role="presentation">
      <a role="menuitem" href="#description">Description</a>
    </li>
    <li role="presentation">
      <a
        role="menuitem"
        href="#associated_wai-aria_roles_states_and_properties">
        Associated WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties
      </a>
    </li>
    <li role="presentation">
      <a role="menuitem" href="#keyboard_interactions">
        Keyboard interactions
      </a>
    </li>
    <li role="presentation">
      <a role="menuitem" href="#examples">Examples</a>
    </li>
    <li role="presentation">
      <a role="menuitem" href="#specifications">Specifications</a>
    </li>
    <li role="presentation">
      <a role="menuitem" href="#see_also">See Also</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

To progressively enhance this navigation widget that is by default accessible, the class to hide the `menu` and the inclusion of `tabindex="-1"` on the interactive menuitem content should be added with JavaScript on load.

When including a "menu" for site navigation, do not use the `menu` role. Rather, for the main site navigation use the native HTML {{HTMLElement('nav')}} element or simply a list of links. The `menu` role should be reserved for composite widgets requiring focus management. See [ARIA practices for disclosure navigation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/examples/disclosure-navigation/) for an explanation and additional examples.

### Example 2: menubar submenu option picker

The following snippet of code is a popup menu nested in a menubar. It is displayed when the menu button is activated. It is a menu to select the text color from a list of color options:

```html
<div>
  <button
    type="button"
    aria-haspopup="menu"
    aria-controls="colormenu"
    tabindex="0"
    aria-label="Text Color: purple">
    Purple
  </button>
  <ul role="menu" id="colormenu" aria-label="Color Options" tabindex="-1">
    <li
      role="menuitemradio"
      aria-checked="true"
      style="color: purple"
      tabindex="-1">
      Purple
    </li>
    <li
      role="menuitemradio"
      aria-checked="false"
      style="color: magenta"
      tabindex="-1">
      Magenta
    </li>
    <li
      role="menuitemradio"
      aria-checked="false"
      style="color: black;"
      tabindex="-1">
      Black
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

The button that opens the menu has [`aria-haspopup="menu"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-haspopup) set, explicitly indicating that the popup it controls is a `menu`.

For a menu to open, the user generally interacts with a menu button as the opener. The menu button must be focusable and respond to both click and keyboard events. When focused, selecting <kbd>Enter</kbd>, <kbd>Space</kbd>, <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>, or the <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> should open the menu and place focus on a menu item.

The opening and closing of the menu toggles the [`aria-expanded="true"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-expanded) attribute on the button. It is added when the menu is open. Removed or set to `false` when the menu is closed. The `true` value indicates that the menu is displayed and that activating the menu button closes the menu.

When the menu is open, the button itself generally does not receive focus as users arrow through the menu items. Rather, <kbd>Escape</kbd> and optionally <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd> closes the menu and returns focus to the menu button.

The `menu` role was set on the {{HTMLElement('ul')}}, identifying the `<ul>` element as a menu.

The showing and hiding of the menu can be done with CSS. For example, in these code examples we can use the attribute and next-sibling selectors to toggle the visibility of the menu:

```css
[role="menu"] {
  display: none;
}
[aria-expanded="true"] + [role="menu"] {
  display: block;
}
```

The navigation example has a static button. The submenu example has a button that gets updated when the user selects a new value. In this case, the `aria-label="Text Color: purple"` is set on the `menu` element. It defines the accessible name for the menu as "Text color: purple"; identifying the purpose of the menu (selecting a text color) and the current value (purple). When a new color is selected, the value of the `aria-label` property should be updated as well.

# ARIA: menubar role

A `menubar` is a presentation of `menu` that usually remains visible and is usually presented horizontally.

## Description

A menu is a widget that offers a list of choices to the user, such as a set of actions or functions. The menubar type of menu is usually presented as a persistently visible horizontal bar of commands. Menubars behave like native operating system menubars, such as the menubars containing pull down menus, commonly found at the top of many desktop application windows.

The `menubar` role is used to create a menu bar similar to those found near the top of the window in many desktop applications, visually persistent, typically horizontal, bar of menu items offering the user quick access to a consistent set of commands.

A `menubar` contains three types of menu items, including [`menuitem`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitem_role), [`menuitemradio`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitemradio_role) and [`menuitemcheckbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitemcheckbox_role). These menu items may optionally be nested in one or more [`group`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/group_role) containers. Groups or items may optionally by separated with [`separator`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/separator_role) elements. While every menu item must be able to receive focus, even if disabled, the `group` and `separator` elements are not focusable.

An example of a native menubar is the bar which may be present at the top of the screen if you are reading this in a desktop browser. An example of a web-based menubar is the horizontal menu bar that reads "File Edit View Insert Format", etc., which is usually visible under the document name in a Google doc.

Menubar interactions should be similar to the typical menu bar interaction in a desktop graphical user interface. In Google Docs, each of those menu items is a `menuitem` with a popup submenu, so each has an `aria-haspopup` attribute set to `true`. The `menubar` element does not.

The menubar and all the menu items are focusable and have a [tabindex](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/tabindex) attribute set. When the menubar receives focus through tabbing, keyboard focus is placed on the first menuitem. Each item in the menu has `tabindex` set to `-1`, except the first item has which has its `tabindex` set to `0`.

If a menubar receives focus as a result of a context action, such as a shortcut key, <kbd>Escape</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> may return focus to the invoking context. That said, make sure not to create shortcut keys that interfere with user agent, operating system, or assistive technology shortcuts - any UA, OS, or AT.

Every menu item, no matter how deeply nested, is able to receive focus, even if disabled.

If a `menubar` has a visible label, include [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) set to a value that refers to the labelling element. Otherwise, provide the menubar with an accessible name by including a descriptive [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label).

A `menuitem` element in the `menubar` can contain a child submenu of menu items. Submenus can be nested several deep. Generally, the outer `menubar` is horizontal and all the submenus are vertical. If this is not the case, if your menubar is vertical, include [`aria-orientation="vertical"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-orientation) on the `menubar` element. Otherwise, this attribute is not necessary, as the default value is horizontal.

### Associated WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties

- [`group`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/group_role) role
  - : Identifies a set of menu items
- [`menuitem`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitem_role) role
  - : An option in a set of choices contained by a `menubar`. May have a submenu.
- [`menuitemradio`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitemradio_role) role
  - : A checkable menu item in a set of elements with the same role, only one of which can be checked at a time.
- [`menuitemcheckbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitemcheckbox_role) role
  - : a menu item with a checkable state whose possible values are `true`, `false`, or `mixed`.
- [`aria-orientation`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-orientation)
  - : Include `aria-orientation="vertical"` on `menubar` element if it's the menubar is vertical. The default orientation is `horizontal`.

### Keyboard interactions

When focus is in a `menubar` it is always on a menu item within the menu bar. When focus is on a top level `menuitem` in a menu bar, the following keyboard interactions must be supported:

- <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>
  - : If the currently focused `menuitem` has a submenu, opens the submenu and places focus on the first item in the submenu.
- <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd>
  - : (Optional) If the currently focused `menuitem` has a submenu, opens the submenu and places focus on the _last_ item in the submenu.
- <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd>
  - : Moves focus to the next item, optionally wrapping from the last to the first.
- <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd>
  - : Moves focus to the previous item, optionally wrapping from the first to the last.
- <kbd>Home</kbd>
  - : If arrow key wrapping is not supported, moves focus to the first item in the `menubar`.
- <kbd>End</kbd>
  - : If arrow key wrapping is not supported, moves focus to the last item in the `menubar`.
- <kbd>Tab</kbd>
  - : Moves focus to the next element in the tab sequence. If that makes it exit the menubar, all submenus in the menubar get closed.
- <kbd>shift + Tab</kbd>
  - : Moves focus to the previous element in the tab sequence. If that makes it exit the menubar, all submenus in the menubar get closed.

See [`menuitem` keyboard interactions](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitem_role#keyboard_interactions), [`menuitemradio` keyboard interactions](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitemradio_role#keyboard_interactions), and [`menuitemcheckbox` keyboard interactions](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitemcheckbox_role#keyboard_interactions) for more information on keyboard interactions when focus is on a menuitem in a menubar (which it always is).

Note: The above interactions assumed the `menubar` is horizontal. If the `menubar` is vertical, include `aria-orientation="vertical"` and change the following keyboard keys accordingly:

- <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>
  - : Performs like the <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> as described above.
- <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd>
  - : Performs like the <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd> as described above
- <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd>
  - : Performs like the <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> as described above.
- <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd>
  - : Performs as the <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> as described above

# ARIA: menuitem role

The `menuitem` role indicates the element is an option in a set of choices contained by a `menu` or `menubar`.

## Description

A `menuitem` is one of the three types of options in a set of choices contained by a [`menu`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menu_role) or [`menubar`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menubar_role); the other two being [`menuitemcheckbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitemcheckbox_role) and [`menuitemradio`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitemradio_role). The `menuitem` is only found as a descendant of, or owned by, elements with role `menu` or `menubar`, optionally nested within an element with role [`group`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/group_role) that is contained in, or owned by, a menu.

If the `menuitem` is not a descendant of a menu in the DOM, include the [`aria-owns`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-owns) attribute on menu to indicate the relationship. If `aria-owns` is set on the menu container to include elements that are not DOM children of the container, those elements will appear in the reading order in the sequence they are referenced and after any items that are DOM children in supporting technologies. Ensure the visual focus order matches the assistive technology reading order.

Every `menuitem` in a menu is focusable, whether or not it is disabled. Indicate a `menuitem` is disabled by setting [`aria-disabled="true"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-disabled) on the element with the role.

If a `menuitem` has a submenu, program it to display a new sub-level menu when the menu item is activated and include [`aria-haspopup="menu"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-haspopup) or with the `true` value to indicate to assistive technologies that the menu item is used to open a submenu.

A common convention for indicating that a `menuitem` launches a dialog box is to append "…" (ellipsis) to the menu item label, e.g., "Save as …".

Every `menuitem` must have an accessible name. This name comes from the element's contents by default. If the contents don't provide for a useful accessible name, [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) can be used to reference visible label. If no visible content is available to provide the accessible name, an accessible name can be provided with [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label).

### Associated WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties

- [`menu`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menu_role) role
  - : A widget providing a list of choices. Required context role (or `menubar`)
- [`menubar`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menubar_role) role
  - : A presentation of a `menu` that usually remains visible and is usually presented horizontally. Required context role (or `menu`)
- [`group`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/group_role) role
  - : Can be used to identify a set of related `menuitem`s within or otherwise owned by a `menu` or `menubar`
- [`aria-disabled`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-disabled)
  - : Indicates the element is perceivable but disabled, so it is not operable
- [`aria-haspopup`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-haspopup)
  - : Indicates the availability and type of interactive popup that can be triggered by the `menuitem`

### Keyboard interactions

- <kbd>Enter</kbd> and <kbd>Space</kbd>
  - : If the `menuitem` has a submenu, opens the submenu and places focus on its first item. Otherwise, activates the item and closes the menu.
- <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>
  - : On a `menuitem` that has a submenu in a `menubar`, opens the submenu and places focus on the first item in the submenu. Otherwise, moves focus to the next item, optionally wrapping from the last to the first.
- <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd>
  - : Moves focus to the previous item, optionally wrapping from the first to the last. Optionally, if the `menuitem` is in a menubar and has a submenu, opens the submenu and places focus on the last item in the submenu.
- <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd>
  - : If in a `menu` opened with a menubutton and not in a `menubar`, if the menuitem does not have a submenu, does nothing. When focus is in a `menubar`, moves focus to the next item, optionally wrapping from the last to the first. When focus is in a `menu` and on a `menuitem` that has a submenu, opens the submenu and places focus on its first item. When focus is in a `menu` and on an item that does not have a submenu, closes the submenu and any parent menus, moves focus to the next item in the `menubar`, and, if focus is now on a `menuitem` with a submenu, either opens the submenu of that `menuitem` without moving focus into the submenu, or opens the submenu of that `menuitem` and places focus on the first item in the submenu.
- <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd>
  - : When focus is in a `menubar`, moves focus to the previous item, optionally wrapping from the first to the last. When focus is in a submenu of an item in a menu, closes the submenu and returns focus to the parent `menuitem`. When focus is in a submenu of an item in a `menubar`, closes the submenu, moves focus to the previous item in the `menubar`, and, if focus is now on a `menuitem` with a submenu, either opens the submenu of that `menuitem` without moving focus into the submenu, or opens the submenu of that `menuitem` and places focus on the first item in the submenu.
- <kbd>Home</kbd>
  - : If arrow key wrapping is not supported, moves focus to the first item in the current `menu` or `menubar`.
- <kbd>End</kbd>
  - : If arrow key wrapping is not supported, moves focus to the last item in the current `menu` or `menubar`.
- Any key that corresponds to a printable character (Optional)
  - : Move focus to the next item in the current menu whose label begins with that printable character.
- <kbd>Escape</kbd>
  - : Close the menu that contains focus and return focus to the element or context, e.g., menu button or parent `menuitem`, from which the menu was opened.
- <kbd>Tab</kbd>
  - : Moves focus to the next element in the tab sequence, and if the item that had focus is not in a menubar, closes its menu and all open parent menu containers.
- <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd>
  - : Moves focus to the previous element in the tab sequence, and if the item that had focus is not in a menubar, closes its menu and all open parent menu containers.

If a menu is opened or a menu bar receives focus as a result of a context action, <kbd>Escape</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> may return focus to the invoking context.

Some implementations of navigation menubars may have menuitem elements that both perform a function and open a submenu. In such implementations, <kbd>Enter</kbd> and <kbd>Space</kbd> perform a navigation function while <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>, in a horizontal menubar, opens the submenu associated with that same menuitem.

When items in a `menubar` are arranged vertically and items in menu containers are arranged horizontally the <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> performs as <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> is described above, the <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> performs as <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd> is described above, and vice versa.

# ARIA: menuitemcheckbox role

A `menuitemcheckbox` is a `menuitem` with a checkable state whose possible values are `true`, `false`, or `mixed`.

## Description

The items in menu and menubars are menu items. There are three types of menu items: [`menuitem`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitem_role), [`menuitemradio`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitemradio_role), and `menuitemcheckbox`.

These three elements can only be contained in, or owned by, an element with role [`menu`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menu_role) or [`menubar`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menubar_role), optionally nested within a grouping element with role of [`group`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/group_role). Being nested or otherwise owned (see [`aria-owns`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-owns)) in a `menu` or `menubar` identifies the menu items as being related widgets.

Menu items, including `menuitemcheckbox` elements, may be grouped within `group` elements or separated by elements with the [`separator`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/separator_role) role or other equivalent native role such as {{HTMLElement('fieldset')}} and {{HTMLElement('hr')}}.

Menu items containing the role of `menuitemcheckbox` must include the [`aria-checked`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-checked) attribute to expose the checkbox's state to assistive technology, unless using [`<input type="checkbox">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/checkbox), in which case the [`checked`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/checkbox#checked) attribute should be used.

Similar to the `checked` attribute of {{HTMLElement('input')}}s of type `checkbox`, the `aria-checked` attribute of a `menuitemcheckbox` indicates whether the menu item is checked (`true`), unchecked (`false`), or represents a sub-level menu of other menu items that have a mixture of checked and unchecked values (`mixed`). The `mixed` value is similar to the checkbox's [`indeterminate`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/checkbox#indeterminate_state_checkboxes) attribute, which gives the appearance of a third, neither checked nor unchecked, state.

An accessible name is required. Ideally, the accessible name should come from an associated {{htmlelement('label')}} element if using `<input type="checkbox">` or visible, descendant content. Realize if the label or descendant content is not sufficient and, preferably, [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) is used referencing non-descendant content or [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) is used, these two ARIA properties will hide other descendant content from assistive technologies.

If all elements in the set are not present in the DOM include the [`aria-setsize`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-setsize) and [`aria-posinset`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-posinset) properties. When specifying `aria-setsize` and `aria-posinset` on a `menuitemcheckbox`, set the value with respect to the total number of items in the menu, excluding any separators.

The `menuitemcheckbox` element can have phrasing content, but can not have interactive content as descendants and no descendants with a `tabindex` attribute specified.

### All descendants are presentational

There are some types of user interface components that, when represented in a platform accessibility API, can only contain text. Accessibility APIs do not have a way of representing semantic elements contained in a `menuitemcheckbox`. To deal with this limitation, browsers, automatically apply role [`presentation`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/presentation_role) to all descendant elements of any `menuitemcheckbox` element as it is a role that does not support semantic children.

For example, consider the following `menuitemcheckbox` element, which contains a heading.

```html
<div role="menuitemcheckbox"><h6>Name of my checkbox</h6></div>
```

Because descendants of `menuitemcheckbox` are presentational, the following code is equivalent:

```html
<div role="menuitemcheckbox">
  <h6 role="presentation">Name of my checkbox</h6>
</div>
```

From the assistive technology user's perspective, the heading does not exist since the previous code snippets are equivalent to the following in the [accessibility tree](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessibility_tree):

```html
<div role="menuitemcheckbox">Name of my checkbox</div>
```

When a `menu` opens, or when a `menubar` receives focus, keyboard focus is placed on the first item. All items in both are focusable, including all `menuitemcheckbox` elements.

If the `menuitemcheckbox` is in a submenu in a `menubar` or a menu opened with a menu button, the following keyboard interactions must be programmed in. :

- <kbd>Enter</kbd>
  - : Toggles the `aria-checked` state of the `menuitemcheckbox` and closes the menu.
- <kbd>Space</kbd>
  - : Toggles the `aria-checked` state of the `menuitemcheckbox`. Does not close the menu.
- <kbd>Escape</kbd>
  - : Closes menu. In menubar, moves focus to parent menubar item.
- <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd>
  - : Closes submenu. In menubar, moves focus to next item in the menubar, opening any submenu if there is one.
- <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd>
  - : Closes menu. In menubar, moves focus to previous item in the menubar, opening any submenu if there is one.
- <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>
  - : Moves focus to the next item in the menu. If focus is on the last item, moves focus to the first item.
- <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd>
  - : Moves focus to previous item in the menu. If focus is on the first item, moves focus to the last item.
- <kbd>Home</kbd>
  - : Moves focus to the first item in the menu.
- <kbd>End</kbd>
  - : Moves focus to the last item in the menu.
- <kbd>Character</kbd>
  - : Moves focus to the next item having a name that starts with the typed character. If none of the items have a name starting with the typed character, focus does not move.

### Required JavaScript

#### Required event handlers

- `onclick`
  - : Handle mouse clicks on both the checkbox and the associated label that will change the state of the checkbox by changing the value of the `aria-checked` attribute and the appearance of the checkbox so it appears checked or unchecked to the sighted user
- `onKeyDown`
  - : Handle the case where the user presses the <kbd>Space</kbd> key to change the state of the checkbox by changing the value of the `aria-checked` attribute and the appearance of the checkbox so it appears checked or unchecked to the sighted user. Also handles all keys listed in the keyboard navigation section above.

## Examples

```html
<li role="menuitemcheckbox" tabindex="-1" aria-checked="false">Purple</li>
```

The [`tabindex="-1"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/tabindex) makes the `menuitemcheckbox` focusable but not part of the page tab sequence. Had we included `aria-checked="true"` it would have indicated that the `menuitemcheckbox` was checked, and we would have visually styled the selected state to look checked using the attribute selector `[role='menuitemcheckbox'][aria-checked='true']`. Instead, the presence of `aria-checked="false"` indicates to assistive technologies that the `menuitemcheckbox` is checkable but not currently checked. The accessible name "purple" comes from the contents.

The visual appearance of the selected state is a checked checkbox which we can create using [generated content](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_generated_content), making it visible and the same color as the content by synchronizing with the `aria-checked` value using CSS [attribute selectors](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) and [inheriting](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inherit) the color.

```css
[role="menuitemcheckbox"]::before {
  display: inline-block;
  content: "";
  color: transparent;
  width: 1em;
  text-align: center;
  outline: 1px solid;
  margin-inline-end: 2px;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
[role="menuitemcheckbox"][aria-checked="true"]::before {
  color: inherit;
  content: "X";
}
```

### Prefer HTML

The first rule of ARIA is: if a native HTML element or attribute has the semantics and behavior you require, use it instead of re-purposing an element and adding an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible. As such, it is recommended to use the native [HTML checkbox](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/checkbox) form control instead of recreating a checkbox's functionality with JavaScript and ARIA.

# ARIA: menuitemradio role

A `menuitemradio` is checkable menuitem in a set of elements with the same role, only one of which can be checked at a time.

## Description

The items in menu and menubars are menu items. There are three types of menu items: [`menuitem`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitem_role), [`menuitemcheckbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menuitemcheckbox_role), and `menuitemradio`. To limit the number of checked menu items to one within a group, use the `menuitemradio` role on all the elements in the group.

A `menuitemradio` is checkable menuitem in a set of elements with the same role, of which only can be checked at a time.

The three menu item elements can only be contained in, or owned by, an element with role [`menu`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menu_role) or [`menubar`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menubar_role), optionally nested within a grouping element with role of [`group`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/group_role). Being nested or otherwise owned (see [`aria-owns`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-owns)) in a `menu` or `menubar` identifies the menu items as being related widgets.

When all items in a submenu are members of the same radio group, the `group` is defined by the menu element; the `group` element is not necessary.

Menu items containing the role of `menuitemradio` must include the [`aria-checked`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-checked) attribute to expose the radio button's state to assistive technology, unless using [`<input type="radio">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/checkbox), in which case the [`checked`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/checkbox#checked) attribute should be used.

Similar to the `checked` attribute of {{HTMLElement('input')}}s of type `radio`, the `aria-checked` attribute of a `menuitemradio` indicates whether the menu item is checked (`true`), unchecked (`false`). There is no `mixed` value like there is for `menuitemcheckbox`.

Only one `menuitemradio` in a group can be checked at the same time. When one item in the group is checked, the `aria-checked` attribute gets set to `true`, while the previously checked `menuitemradio` element in the same group, if there was one, becomes unchecked, by having the `aria-checked` attribute value switched to `false`.

If your want more than one item in a group to be checked, or if you want to enable checking and unchecking an item, consider using `menuitemcheckbox`.

If a `menu` or `menubar` contains more than one group of `menuitemradio` elements, or if the `menu` contains a group of `menuitemradio` elements as well as other, unrelated `menuitem` elements and/or `menuitemcheckbox` elements, contain each set of related `menuitemradio` elements in a `group` element or delimit the group the `menuitemradio` elements from the other menu items with a `separator` element (or an HTML element with an equivalent role such as a {{HTMLElement('fieldset')}} grouping or a thematic break {{HTMLElement('hr')}} separator.

An accessible name is required. Ideally, the accessible name should come from an associated {{htmlelement('label')}} element if using `<input type="radio">` or visible, descendant content. Realize if the label or descendant content is not sufficient and, preferably, [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) is used referencing non-descendant content or [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) is used, these two ARIA properties will hide other descendant content from assistive technologies.

If all elements in the set are not present in the DOM include the [`aria-setsize`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-setsize) and [`aria-posinset`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-posinset) properties. When specifying `aria-setsize` and `aria-posinset` on a `menuitemradio`, set the value with respect to the total number of items in the menu, excluding any separators.

The `menuitemradio` element can have phrasing content, but can not have interactive content as descendants and no descendants with a `tabindex` attribute specified.

### All descendants are presentational

There are some types of user interface components that, when represented in a platform accessibility API, can only contain text. Accessibility APIs do not have a way of representing semantic elements contained in a `menuitemradio`. To deal with this limitation, browsers, automatically apply role [`presentation`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/presentation_role) to all descendant elements of any `menuitemradio` element as it is a role that does not support semantic children.

For example, consider the following `menuitemradio` element, which contains a heading.

```html
<div role="menuitemradio"><h6>Name of my radio button</h6></div>
```

Because descendants of `menuitemradio` are presentational, the following code is equivalent:

```html
<div role="menuitemradio">
  <h6 role="presentation">Name of my radio button</h6>
</div>
```

From the assistive technology user's perspective, the heading does not exist since the previous code snippets are equivalent to the following in the [accessibility tree](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessibility_tree):

```html
<div role="menuitemradio">Name of my radio button</div>
```

### Associated WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties

- [`menu`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menu_role) role
  - : Widget that offers a list of common actions or functions the user can invoke.
- [`menubar`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menubar_role) role
  - : Similar to `menu` for a consistent set of frequently used commands remaining visible and usually presented horizontally.
- [`group`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/group_role) role
  - : Container for a group of `menuitem` elements, including `menuitemradio` elements within a `menu` or `menubar`.
- [`aria-checked`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-checked) (Required)
  - : Set to `true` or `false`, it indicates the current "checked" state of the menuitemradio

### Keyboard interactions

When a `menu` opens, or when a `menubar` receives focus, keyboard focus is placed on the first item. All items in both are focusable, including all `menuitemradio` elements.

If the `menuitemradio` is in a submenu in a `menubar` or a menu opened with a menu button, the following keyboard interactions must be programmed in. :

- <kbd>Enter</kbd>
  - : If not checked, checks the focused `menuitemradio` and unchecks any other checked `menuitemradio` element in the same group. Also, closes the menu.
- <kbd>Space</kbd>
  - : If not checked, checks the focused `menuitemradio` and unchecks any other checked `menuitemradio` element in the same group without closing the menu.
- <kbd>Escape</kbd>
  - : Closes menu. In menubar, moves focus to parent menubar item.
- <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd>
  - : Closes submenu. In menubar, moves focus to next item in the menubar, opening any submenu if there is one.
- <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd>
  - : Closes menu. In menubar, moves focus to previous item in the menubar, opening any submenu if there is one.
- <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>
  - : Moves focus to the next item in the menu. If focus is on the last item, moves focus to the first item.
- <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd>
  - : Moves focus to previous item in the menu. If focus is on the first item, moves focus to the last item.
- <kbd>Home</kbd>
  - : Moves focus to the first item in the menu.
- <kbd>End</kbd>
  - : Moves focus to the last item in the menu.
- <kbd>Character</kbd>
  - : Moves focus to the next item having a name that starts with the typed character. If none of the items have a name starting with the typed character, focus does not move.

### Required JavaScript

#### Required event handlers

- `onclick`
  - : Handle mouse clicks on both the radio button and the associated label that will change the state of the radio button by changing the value of the `aria-checked` attribute and the appearance of the radio button so it appears checked or unchecked to the sighted user
- `onKeyDown`
  - : Handle the case where the user presses the <kbd>Space</kbd> key to change the state of the radio button by changing the value of the `aria-checked` attribute and the appearance of the radio button so it appears checked or unchecked to the sighted user. Also handles all keys listed in the keyboard navigation section above.

## Examples

```html
<li role="menuitemradio" tabindex="-1" aria-checked="false">Purple</li>
```

The [`tabindex="-1"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/tabindex) makes the `menuitemradio` focusable but not part of the page tab sequence. Had we included `aria-checked="true"` it would have indicated that the `menuitemradio` was checked, and we would have visually styled the selected state to look checked using the attribute selector `[role='menuitemradio'][aria-checked='true']`. Instead, the presence of `aria-checked="false"` indicates to assistive technologies that the `menuitemradio` is checkable but not currently checked. The accessible name "purple" comes from the contents.

The visual appearance of the selected state is a checked radio button which we can create using [generated content](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_generated_content), making it visible and the same color as the content by synchronizing with the `aria-checked` value using CSS [attribute selectors](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) and changing the [`background-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color).

```css
[role="menuitemradio"]::before {
  display: inline-block;
  content: "";
  width: 1em;
  height: 1em;
  padding: 0.1em;
  border: 2px solid #333333;
  border-radius: 50%;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  background-clip: content-box;
  margin-inline-end: 2px;
}
[role="menuitemradio"][aria-checked="true"]::before {
  background-color: purple;
}
```

Don't use the [`background`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background) shorthand property, as that will override the [`background-clip`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-clip) property we used to create the radio button effect.

### Prefer HTML

The first rule of ARIA is: if a native HTML element or attribute has the semantics and behavior you require, use it instead of re-purposing an element and adding an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible. As such, it is recommended to use the native [HTML radio button](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/radio) form control instead of recreating a radio button's functionality with JavaScript and ARIA.

# ARIA: meter role

The `meter` role is used to identify an element being used as a meter.

> [!NOTE]
> Where possible, it is recommended that you use a native {{HTMLElement("meter")}} element rather than the `meter` role, as native elements are more widely supported by user agents and assistive technology.

## Description

A meter is a graphical display of a numeric value within a defined range. For example, showing battery percentage. A meter is not appropriate for values that do not have a meaningful maximum limit. Meters should not be used to indicate progress (for example loading), this should be communicated with the {{HTMLElement('progress')}} element.

Each element with `role="meter"` must also have one of the following:

- An [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label) attribute.
- An [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby) attribute pointing to an element with text that describes the meter.

### All descendants are presentational

There are some types of user interface components that, when represented in a platform accessibility API, can only contain text. Accessibility APIs do not have a way of representing semantic elements contained in a `meter`. To deal with this limitation, browsers, automatically apply role [`presentation`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/presentation_role) to all descendant elements of any `meter` element as it is a role that does not support semantic children.

For example, consider the following `meter` element, which contains a heading.

```html
<div role="meter"><h3>Title of my meter</h3></div>
```

Because descendants of `meter` are presentational, the following code is equivalent:

```html
<div role="meter"><h3 role="presentation">Title of my meter</h3></div>
```

From the assistive technology user's perspective, the heading does not exist since the previous code snippets are equivalent to the following in the [accessibility tree](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessibility_tree).:

```html
<div role="meter">Title of my meter</div>
```

### Associated ARIA roles, states, and properties

- [`aria-valuenow`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-valuenow)
  - : Set to a decimal value between `aria-valuemin` and `aria-valuemax` indicating the current value of the meter.
- [`aria-valuetext`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-valuetext)
  - : Assistive technologies often present the value of `aria-valuenow` as a percentage. If this would not be accurate use this property to make the meter value understandable.
- [`aria-valuemin`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-valuemin)
  - : Set to a decimal value representing the minimum value, and less than `aria-valuemax`.
- [`aria-valuemax`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-valuemax)
  - : Set to a decimal value representing the maximum value, and greater than `aria-valuemin`.

It is recommended to use a native {{HTMLElement("meter")}} element rather than the `meter` role. User agents provide a stylize widget for the {{HTMLElement("meter")}} element based on the current `value` as it relates to the `min` and `max` values. When using non-semantic elements, all features of the native semantic element need to be recreated with ARIA attributes, JavaScript and CSS.

## Examples

An example of a meter using `role="meter"`:

```html
<div
  role="meter"
  aria-valuenow="90"
  aria-valuemin="0"
  aria-valuemax="100"
  aria-labelledby="cpu_usage_label">
  <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" style="width: 90%">
    <rect x="0" y="0" width="100%" height="100%" fill="currentColor"></rect>
  </svg>
</div>
```

In the above scenario, when the `aria-valuenow` value updates, the width of the SVG also needs to be updated as can be seen in [the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG) working meter example](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/meter/examples/meter/).

# ARIA: navigation role

The `navigation` role is used to identify major groups of links used for navigating through a website or page content.

```html
<div role="navigation" aria-label="Main">
  <!-- list of links to main website locations -->
</div>
```

This is a website's main navigation.

## Description

The `navigation` role is [a landmark](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles#3._landmark_roles) role. Landmark roles provide a way to identify the organization and structure of a web page. By classifying and labeling sections of a page, structural information conveyed visually through layout is represented programmatically. Screen readers use landmark roles to provide keyboard navigation to important sections of a page. Like the HTML {{HTMLElement('nav')}} element, navigation landmarks provide a way to identify groups (e.g., lists) of links that are intended to be used for website or page content navigation. If a page includes more than one navigation landmark, each should have a unique label. If two or more navigational landmark on a page have the same set of links, use the same label for each.

It is preferable to use the HTML5 [`<nav>` element](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/nav) to define a navigation landmark. If the HTML5 nav element technique is not being used, use a `role="navigation"` attribute to define a navigation landmark.

> [!NOTE]
> Using the {{HTMLElement('nav')}} element will automatically communicate a section has a role of `navigation`. Developers should always prefer using the correct semantic HTML element over using ARIA

### Associated WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties

- [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-label)
  - : A brief description of the purpose of the navigation, omitting the term "navigation", as the screen reader will read both the role and the contents of the label.

### Keyboard interactions

None.

### Required JavaScript features

None.

## Examples

```html
<div role="navigation" aria-label="Customer service">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#">Help</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Order tracking</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Shipping &amp; Delivery</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Returns</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Contact us</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Find a store</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

## Accessibility concerns

[Landmark roles](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles#3._landmark_roles) are intended to be used sparingly, to identify larger overall sections of the document. Using too many landmark roles can create "noise" in screen readers, making it difficult to understand the overall layout of the page.

## Best practices

### Prefer HTML

Using the {{HTMLElement('nav')}} element will automatically communicate that the element has a role of `navigation`. If possible, prefer using the semantic `<nav>` element instead of the `navigation` role.

### Labeling landmarks

#### Multiple landmarks

If there is more than one `navigation` landmark role or {{HTMLElement('nav')}} element in a document, provide a label for each landmark. This label will allow an assistive technology user to be able to quickly understand the purpose of each landmark.

```html
<div id="main-nav" role="navigation" aria-label="Main">
  <!-- content -->
</div>

…

<nav id="footer-nav" aria-label="Footer">
  <!-- content -->
</nav>
```

#### Repeated landmarks

If a `navigation` landmark role or {{HTMLElement('nav')}} element in a document is repeated in a document, and both landmarks have identical content, use the same label for each landmark. An example of this would be repeating the main navigation at the top and bottom of the page.

```html
<header>
  <nav id="main-nav" aria-label="Main">
    <!-- list of links to main website locations -->
  </nav>
</header>

…

<footer>
  <nav id="footer-nav" aria-label="Main">
    <!-- list of links to main website locations -->
  </nav>
</footer>
```

#### Redundant descriptions

Screen readers will announce the type of role the landmark is. Because of this, you do not need to describe what the landmark is in its label. For example, a declaration of `role="navigation"` with an of `aria-label="Primary navigation"` may be announced redundantly as, "primary navigation navigation".

# ARIA: none role

The `none` role is a synonym for the [`presentation`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/presentation_role) role; they both remove an element's implicit ARIA semantics from being exposed to the accessibility tree.

See the [`presentation`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/presentation_role) role for more information.
