# Adding a new todo form: Vue events, methods, and models

{{PreviousMenuNext("Learn_web_development/Core/Frameworks_libraries/Vue_rendering_lists","Learn_web_development/Core/Frameworks_libraries/Vue_styling", "Learn_web_development/Core/Frameworks_libraries")}}

We now have sample data in place, and a loop that takes each bit of data and renders it inside a `ToDoItem` in our app. What we really need next is the ability to allow our users to enter their own todo items into the app, and for that we'll need a text `<input>`, an event to fire when the data is submitted, a method to fire upon submission to add the data and rerender the list, and a model to control the data. This is what we'll cover in this article.

## Creating a New To-Do form

We now have an app that displays a list of to-do items. However, we can't update our list of items without manually changing our code! Let's fix that. Let's create a new component that will allow us to add a new to-do item.

1. In your components folder, create a new file called `ToDoForm.vue`.
2. Add a blank `<template>` and a `<script>` tag like before:

   ```vue
   <template></template>

   <script>
   export default {};
   </script>
   ```

3. Let's add in an HTML form that lets you enter a new todo item and submit it into the app. We need a [`<form>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form) with a [`<label>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/label), an [`<input>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input), and a [`<button>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/button). Update your template as follows:

   ```vue
   <template>
     <form>
       <label for="new-todo-input"> What needs to be done? </label>
       <input
         type="text"
         id="new-todo-input"
         name="new-todo"
         autocomplete="off" />
       <button type="submit">Add</button>
     </form>
   </template>
   ```

   So we now have a form component into which we can enter the title of a new todo item (which will become a label for the corresponding `ToDoItem` when it is eventually rendered).

4. Let's load this component into our app. Go back to `App.vue` and add the following `import` statement just below the previous one, inside your `<script>` element:

   ```js
   import ToDoForm from "./components/ToDoForm.vue";
   ```

5. You also need to register the new component in your `App` component — update the `components` property of the component object so that it looks like this:

   ```js
   export default {
     // …
     components: {
       ToDoItem,
       ToDoForm,
     },
     // …
   };
   ```

6. Finally for this section, render your `ToDoForm` component inside your app by adding the `<to-do-form />` element inside your `App`'s `<template>`, like so:

   ```vue
   <template>
     <div id="app">
       <h1>My To-Do List</h1>
       <to-do-form></to-do-form>
       <ul>
         <li v-for="item in ToDoItems" :key="item.id">
           <to-do-item
             :label="item.label"
             :done="item.done"
             :id="item.id"></to-do-item>
         </li>
       </ul>
     </div>
   </template>
   ```

Now when you view your running site, you should see the new form displayed.

![Our todo list app rendered with a text input to enter new todos](rendered-form-with-text-input.png)

If you fill it out and click the "Add" button, the page will post the form back to the server, but this isn't really what we want. What we actually want to do is run a method on the [`submit` event](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/submit_event) that will add the new todo to the `ToDoItem` data list defined inside `App`. To do that, we'll need to add a method to the component instance.

## Creating a method & binding it to an event with v-on

To make a method available to the `ToDoForm` component, we need to add it to the component object, and this is done inside a `methods` property to our component, which goes in the same place as `data()`, `props`, etc. The `methods` property holds any methods we might need to call in our component. When referenced, methods are fully run, so it's not a good idea to use them to display information inside the template. For displaying data that comes from calculations, you should use a `computed` property, which we'll cover later.

1. In this component, we need to add an `onSubmit()` method to a `methods` property inside the `ToDoForm` component object. We'll use this to handle the submit action.

   Add this like so:

   ```js
   export default {
     methods: {
       onSubmit() {
         console.log("form submitted");
       },
     },
   };
   ```

2. Next we need to bind the method to our `<form>` element's `submit` event handler. Much like how Vue uses the [`v-bind`](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-directives.html#v-bind) syntax for binding attributes, Vue has a special directive for event handling: [`v-on`](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-directives.html#v-on). The `v-on` directive works via the `v-on:event="method"` syntax. And much like `v-bind`, there's also a shorthand syntax: `@event="method"`.

   We'll use the shorthand syntax here for consistency. Add the `submit` handler to your `<form>` element like so:

   ```vue
   <form @submit="onSubmit">…</form>
   ```

3. When you run this, the app still posts the data to the server, causing a refresh. Since we're doing all of our processing on the client, there's no server to handle the postback. We also lose all local state on page refresh. To prevent the browser from posting to the server, we need to stop the event's default action while bubbling up through the page ([`Event.preventDefault()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault), in vanilla JavaScript). Vue has a special syntax called **event modifiers** that can handle this for us right in our template.

   Modifiers are appended to the end of an event with a dot like so: `@event.modifier`. Here is a list of event modifiers:
   - `.stop`: Stops the event from propagating. Equivalent to [`Event.stopPropagation()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/stopPropagation) in regular JavaScript events.
   - `.prevent`: Prevents the event's default behavior. Equivalent to [`Event.preventDefault()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault).
   - `.self`: Triggers the handler only if the event was dispatched from this exact element.
   - `{.key}`: Triggers the event handler only via the specified key. [MDN has a list of valid key values](/en-US/docs/Web/API/UI_Events/Keyboard_event_key_values); multi-word keys just need to be converted to {{Glossary("kebab_case", "kebab-case")}} (e.g., `page-down`).
   - `.native`: Listens for a native event on the root (outer-most wrapping) element on your component.
   - `.once`: Listens for the event until it's been triggered once, and then no more.
   - `.left`: Only triggers the handler via the left mouse button event.
   - `.right`: Only triggers the handler via the right mouse button event.
   - `.middle`: Only triggers the handler via the middle mouse button event.
   - `.passive`: Equivalent to using the `{ passive: true }` parameter when creating an event listener in vanilla JavaScript using [`addEventListener()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener).

   In this case, we need to use the `.prevent` modifier to stop the browser's default submit action. Add `.prevent` to the `@submit` handler in your template like so:

   ```vue
   <form @submit.prevent="onSubmit">…</form>
   ```

If you try submitting the form now, you'll notice that the page doesn't reload. If you open the console, you can see the results of the [`console.log()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/log_static) we added inside our `onSubmit()` method.

## Binding data to inputs with v-model

Next up, we need a way to get the value from the form's `<input>` so we can add the new to-do item to our `ToDoItems` data list.

The first thing we need is a `data` property in our form to track the value of the to-do.

1. Add a `data()` method to our `ToDoForm` component object that returns a `label` field. We can set the initial value of the `label` to an empty string.

   Your component object should now look something like this:

   ```js
   export default {
     methods: {
       onSubmit() {
         console.log("form submitted");
       },
     },
     data() {
       return {
         label: "",
       };
     },
   };
   ```

2. We now need some way to attach the value of the `new-todo-input` element's field to the `label` field. Vue has a special directive for this: [`v-model`](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-directives.html#v-model). `v-model` binds to the data property you set on it and keeps it in sync with the `<input>`. `v-model` works across all the various input types, including checkboxes, radios, and select inputs. To use `v-model`, you add an attribute with the structure `v-model="variable"` to the `<input>`.

   So in our case, we would add it to our `new-todo-input` field as seen below. Do this now:

   ```vue
   <input
     type="text"
     id="new-todo-input"
     name="new-todo"
     autocomplete="off"
     v-model="label" />
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can also sync data with `<input>` values through a combination of events and `v-bind` attributes. In fact, this is what `v-model` does behind the scenes. However, the exact event and attribute combination varies depending on input types and will take more code than just using the `v-model` shortcut.

3. Let's test out our use of `v-model` by logging the value of the data submitted in our `onSubmit()` method. In components, data attributes are accessed using the `this` keyword. So we access our `label` field using `this.label`.

   Update your `onSubmit()` method to look like this:

   ```js
   export default {
     methods: {
       onSubmit() {
         console.log("Label value: ", this.label);
       },
     },
   };
   ```

4. Now go back to your running app, add some text to the `<input>` field, and click the "Add" button. You should see the value you entered logged to your console, for example:

   ```plain
   Label value: My value
   ```

## Changing v-model behavior with modifiers

In a similar fashion to event modifiers, we can also add modifiers to change the behavior of `v-model`. In our case, there are two worth considering. The first, `.trim`, will remove whitespace from before or after the input. We can add the modifier to our `v-model` statement like so: `v-model.trim="label"`.

The second modifier we should consider is called `.lazy`. This modifier changes when `v-model` syncs the value for text inputs. As mentioned earlier, `v-model` syncing works by updating the variable using events. For text inputs, this sync happens using the [`input` event](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/input_event). Often, this means that Vue is syncing the data after every keystroke. The `.lazy` modifier causes `v-model` to use the [`change` event](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/change_event) instead. This means that Vue will only sync data when the input loses focus or the form is submitted. For our purposes, this is much more reasonable since we only need the final data.

To use both the `.lazy` modifier and the `.trim` modifier together, we can chain them, e.g., `v-model.lazy.trim="label"`.

Update your `v-model` attribute to chain `lazy` and `trim` as shown above, and then test your app again. Try for example, submitting a value with whitespace at each end.

## Passing data to parents with custom events

We now are very close to being able to add new to-do items to our list. The next thing we need to be able to do is pass the newly-created to-do item to our `App` component. To do that, we can have our `ToDoForm` emit a custom event that passes the data, and have `App` listen for it. This works very similarly to native events on HTML elements: a child component can emit an event which can be listened to via `v-on`.

In the `onSubmit` event handler of our `ToDoForm`, let's add a `todo-added` event. Custom events are emitted like this: `this.$emit("event-name")`. It's important to know that event handlers are case sensitive and cannot include spaces. Vue templates also get converted to lowercase, which means Vue templates cannot listen for events named with capital letters.

1. Replace the `console.log()` in the `onSubmit()` method with the following:

   ```js
   this.$emit("todo-added");
   ```

2. Next, go back to `App.vue` and add a `methods` property to your component object containing an `addToDo()` method, as shown below. For now, this method can just log `To-do added` to the console.

   ```js
   export default {
     name: "app",
     components: {
       ToDoItem,
       ToDoForm,
     },
     data() {
       return {
         ToDoItems: [
           { id: `todo-${nanoid()}`, label: "Learn Vue", done: false },
           {
             id: `todo-${nanoid()}`,
             label: "Create a Vue project with the CLI",
             done: true,
           },
           { id: `todo-${nanoid()}`, label: "Have fun", done: true },
           {
             id: `todo-${nanoid()}`,
             label: "Create a to-do list",
             done: false,
           },
         ],
       };
     },
     methods: {
       addToDo() {
         console.log("To-do added");
       },
     },
   };
   ```

3. Next, add an event listener for the `todo-added` event to the `<to-do-form></to-do-form>`, which calls the `addToDo()` method when the event fires. Using the `@` shorthand, the listener would look like this: `@todo-added="addToDo"`:

   ```vue
   <to-do-form @todo-added="addToDo"></to-do-form>
   ```

4. When you submit your `ToDoForm`, you should see the console log from the `addToDo()` method. This is good, but we're still not passing any data back into the `App.vue` component. We can do that by passing additional arguments to the `this.$emit()` function back in the `ToDoForm` component.

   In this case, when we fire the event we want to pass the `label` data along with it. This is done by including the data you want to pass as another parameter in the `$emit()` method: `this.$emit("todo-added", this.label)`. This is similar to how native JavaScript events include data, except custom Vue events include no event object by default. This means that the emitted event will directly match whatever object you submit. So in our case, our event object will just be a string.

   Update your `onSubmit()` method like so:

   ```js
   export default {
     // …
     methods: {
       // …
       onSubmit() {
         this.$emit("todo-added", this.label);
       },
       // …
     },
     // …
   };
   ```

5. To actually pick up this data inside `App.vue`, we need to add a parameter to our `addToDo()` method that includes the `label` of the new to-do item.

   Go back to `App.vue` and update this now:

   ```js
   export default {
     // …
     methods: {
       // …
       addToDo(toDoLabel) {
         console.log("To-do added:", toDoLabel);
       },
       // …
     },
     // …
   };
   ```

If you test your form again, you'll see whatever text you enter logged in your console upon submission. Vue automatically passes the arguments after the event name in `this.$emit()` to your event handler.

## Adding the new todo into our data

Now that we have the data from `ToDoForm` available in `App.vue`, we need to add an item representing it to the `ToDoItems` array. This can be done by pushing a new to-do item object to the array containing our new data.

1. Update your `addToDo()` method like so:

   ```js
   export default {
     // …
     methods: {
       // …
       addToDo(toDoLabel) {
         this.ToDoItems.push({
           id: `todo-${nanoid()}`,
           label: toDoLabel,
           done: false,
         });
       },
       // …
     },
     // …
   };
   ```

2. Try testing your form again, and you should see new to-do items get appended to the end of the list.
3. Let's make a further improvement before we move on. If you submit the form while the input is empty, todo items with no text still get added to the list. To fix that, we can prevent the todo-added event from firing when name is empty. Since name is already being trimmed by the `.trim` modifier, we only need to test for the empty string.

   Go back to your `ToDoForm` component, and update the `onSubmit()` method like so. If the label value is empty, let's not emit the `todo-added` event.

   ```js
   export default {
     // …
     methods: {
       // …
       onSubmit() {
         if (this.label === "") {
           return;
         }
         this.$emit("todo-added", this.label);
       },
       // …
     },
     // …
   };
   ```

4. Try your form again. Now you will not be able to add empty items to the to-do list.

![Our todo list app rendered with a text input to enter new todos](rendered-form-with-new-items.png)

## Using v-model to update an input value

There's one more thing to fix in our `ToDoForm` component — after submitting, the `<input>` still contains the old value. But this is easy to fix — because we're using `v-model` to bind the data to the `<input>` in `ToDoForm`, if we set the name parameter to equal an empty string, the input will update as well.

Update your `ToDoForm` component's `onSubmit()` method to this:

```js
export default {
  // …
  methods: {
    // …
    onSubmit() {
      if (this.label === "") {
        return;
      }
      this.$emit("todo-added", this.label);
      this.label = "";
    },
    // …
  },
  // …
};
```

Now when you click the "Add" button, the "new-todo-input" will clear itself.

## Summary

Excellent. We can now add todo items to our form! Our app is now starting to feel interactive, but one issue is that we've completely ignored its look and feel up to now. In the next article, we'll concentrate on fixing this, looking at the different ways Vue provides to style components.

# Vue refs and lifecycle methods for focus management

{{PreviousMenuNext("Learn_web_development/Core/Frameworks_libraries/Vue_conditional_rendering","Learn_web_development/Core/Frameworks_libraries/Vue_resources", "Learn_web_development/Core/Frameworks_libraries")}}

We are nearly done with Vue. The last bit of functionality to look at is focus management, or put another way, how we can improve our app's keyboard accessibility. We'll look at using **Vue refs** to handle this — an advanced feature that allows you to have direct access to the underlying DOM nodes below the virtual DOM, or direct access from one component to the internal DOM structure of a child component.

## The focus management problem

While we do have working edit functionality, we aren't providing a great experience for non-mouse users. Specifically, when a user activates the "Edit" button, we remove the "Edit" button from the DOM, but we don't move the user's focus anywhere, so in effect it just disappears. This can be disorienting for keyboard and non-visual users.

To understand what's currently happening:

1. Reload your page, then press <kbd>Tab</kbd>. You should see a focus outline on the input for adding new to-do items.

2. Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> again. The focus should move to the "Add" button.

3. Hit it again, and it'll be on the first checkbox. One more time, and focus should be on the first "Edit" button.
4. Activate the "Edit" button by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
   The checkbox will be replaced with our edit component, but the focus outline will be gone.

This behavior can be jarring. In addition, what happens when you press <kbd>Tab</kbd> again varies depending on the browser you're using. Similarly, if you save or cancel your edit, focus will disappear again as you move back to the non-edit view.

To give users a better experience, we'll add code to control the focus so that it gets set to the edit field when the edit form is shown. We'll also want to put focus back on the "Edit" button when a user cancels or saves their edit. In order to set focus, we need to understand a little bit more about how Vue works internally.

## Virtual DOM and refs

Vue, like some other frameworks, uses a virtual DOM (VDOM) to manage elements. This means that Vue keeps a representation of all of the nodes in our app in memory. Any updates are first performed on the in-memory nodes, and then all the changes that need to be made to the actual nodes on the page are synced in a batch.

Since reading and writing actual DOM nodes is often more expensive than virtual nodes, this can result in better performance. However, it also means you often should not edit your HTML elements directly through native browser APIs (like [`Document.getElementById`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById)) when using frameworks, because it results in the VDOM and real DOM going out of sync.

Instead, if you need to access the underlying DOM nodes (like when setting focus), you can use [Vue refs](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-refs.html). For custom Vue components, you can also use refs to directly access the internal structure of a child component, however this should be done with caution as it can make code harder to reason about and understand.

To use a ref in a component, you add a `ref` attribute to the element that you want to access, with a string identifier for the value of the attribute. It's important to note that a ref needs to be unique within a component. No two elements rendered at the same time should have the same ref.

### Adding a ref to our app

So, let's attach a ref to our "Edit" button in `ToDoItem.vue`. Update it like this:

```vue
<button
  type="button"
  class="btn"
  ref="editButton"
  @click="toggleToItemEditForm">
  Edit
  <span class="visually-hidden">\{{label}}</span>
</button>
```

To access the value associated with our ref, we use the `$refs` property provided on our component instance. To see the value of the ref when we click our "Edit" button, add a `console.log()` to our `toggleToItemEditForm()` method, like so:

```js
export default {
  // …
  methods: {
    // …
    toggleToItemEditForm() {
      console.log(this.$refs.editButton);
      this.isEditing = true;
    },
    // …
  },
  // …
};
```

If you activate the "Edit" button at this point, you should see an HTML `<button>` element referenced in your console.

## Vue's $nextTick() method

We want to set focus on the "Edit" button when a user saves or cancels their edit. To do that, we need to handle focus in the `ToDoItem` component's `itemEdited()` and `editCancelled()` methods.

For convenience, create a new method which takes no arguments called `focusOnEditButton()`. Inside it, assign your `ref` to a variable, and then call the `focus()` method on the ref.

```js
export default {
  // …
  methods: {
    // …
    focusOnEditButton() {
      const editButtonRef = this.$refs.editButton;
      editButtonRef.focus();
    },
    // …
  },
  // …
};
```

Next, add a call to `this.focusOnEditButton()` at the end of the `itemEdited()` and `editCancelled()` methods:

```js
export default {
  // …
  methods: {
    // …
    itemEdited(newItemName) {
      this.$emit("item-edited", newItemName);
      this.isEditing = false;
      this.focusOnEditButton();
    },
    editCancelled() {
      this.isEditing = false;
      this.focusOnEditButton();
    },
    // …
  },
  // …
};
```

Try editing and then saving/cancelling a to-do item via your keyboard. You'll notice that focus isn't being set, so we still have a problem to solve. If you open your console, you'll see an error raised along the lines of _"can't access property "focus", editButtonRef is undefined"_. This seems weird. Your button ref was defined when you activated the "Edit" button, but now it's not. What is going on?

Well, remember that when we change `isEditing` to `true`, we no longer render the section of the component featuring the "Edit" button. This means there's no element to bind the ref to, so it becomes `undefined`.

You might now be thinking "hey, don't we set `isEditing=false` before we try to access the `ref`, so therefore shouldn't the `v-if` now be displaying the button?" This is where the virtual DOM comes into play. Because Vue is trying to optimize and batch changes, it won't immediately update the DOM when we set `isEditing` to `false`. So when we call `focusOnEditButton()`, the "Edit" button has not been rendered yet.

Instead, we need to wait until after Vue undergoes the next DOM update cycle. To do that, Vue components have a special method called `$nextTick()`. This method accepts a callback function, which then executes after the DOM updates.

Since the `focusOnEditButton()` method needs to be invoked after the DOM has updated, we can wrap the existing function body inside a `$nextTick()` call.

```js
export default {
  // …
  methods: {
    // …
    focusOnEditButton() {
      this.$nextTick(() => {
        const editButtonRef = this.$refs.editButton;
        editButtonRef.focus();
      });
    },
    // …
  },
  // …
};
```

Now when you activate the "Edit" button and then cancel or save your changes via the keyboard, focus should be returned to the "Edit" button. Success!

## Vue lifecycle methods

Next, we need to move focus to the edit form's `<input>` element when the "Edit" button is clicked. However, because our edit form is in a different component to our "Edit" button, we can't just set focus inside the "Edit" button's click event handler. Instead, we can use the fact that we remove and re-mount our `ToDoItemEditForm` component whenever the "Edit" button is clicked to handle this.

So how does this work? Well, Vue components undergo a series of events, known as a **lifecycle**. This lifecycle spans from all the way before elements are _created_ and added to the VDOM (_mounted_), until they are removed from the VDOM (_destroyed_).

Vue lets you run methods at various stages of this lifecycle using **lifecycle methods**. This can be useful for things like data fetching, where you may need to get your data before your component renders, or after a property changes. The list of lifecycle methods are below, in the order that they fire.

1. `beforeCreate()` — Runs before the instance of your component is created. Data and events are not yet available.
2. `created()` — Runs after your component is initialized but before the component is added to the VDOM. This is often where data fetching occurs.
3. `beforeMount()` — Runs after your template is compiled, but before your component is rendered to the actual DOM.
4. `mounted()` — Runs after your component is mounted to the DOM. Can access `refs` here.
5. `beforeUpdate()` — Runs whenever data in your component changes, but before the changes are rendered to the DOM.
6. `updated()` — Runs whenever data in your component has changed and after the changes are rendered to the DOM.
7. `beforeDestroy()` — Runs before a component is removed from the DOM.
8. `destroyed()` — Runs after a component has been removed from the DOM.
9. `activated()` — Only used in components wrapped in a special `keep-alive` tag. Runs after the component is activated.
10. `deactivated()` — Only used in components wrapped in a special `keep-alive` tag. Runs after the component is deactivated.

> [!NOTE]
> The Vue Docs provide a [nice diagram for visualizing when these hooks happen](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/lifecycle.html#lifecycle-diagram). This article from the [DigitalOcean Community Blog dives into the lifecycle methods more deeply](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/vuejs-component-lifecycle).

Now that we've gone over the lifecycle methods, let's use one to trigger focus when our `ToDoItemEditForm` component is mounted.

In `ToDoItemEditForm.vue`, attach `ref="labelInput"` to the `<input>` element, like so:

```vue
<input
  :id="id"
  ref="labelInput"
  type="text"
  autocomplete="off"
  v-model.lazy.trim="newName" />
```

Next, add a `mounted()` property just inside your component object — **note that this should not be put inside the `methods` property, but rather at the same hierarchy level as `props`, `data()`, and `methods`.** Lifecycle methods are special methods that sit on their own, not alongside the user-defined methods. This should take no inputs. Note that you cannot use an arrow function here since we need access to `this` to access our `labelInput` ref.

```js
export default {
  // …
  mounted() {},
  // …
};
```

Inside your `mounted()` method, assign your `labelInput` ref to a variable, and then call the `focus()` function of the ref. You don't have to use `$nextTick()` here because the component has already been added to the DOM when `mounted()` is called.

```js
export default {
  // …
  mounted() {
    const labelInputRef = this.$refs.labelInput;
    labelInputRef.focus();
  },
  // …
};
```

Now when you activate the "Edit" button with your keyboard, focus should immediately be moved to the edit `<input>`.

## Handling focus when deleting to-do items

There's one more place we need to consider focus management: when a user deletes a to-do. When clicking the "Edit" button, it makes sense to move focus to the edit name text box, and back to the "Edit" button when canceling or saving from the edit screen.

However, unlike with the edit form, we don't have a clear location for focus to move to when an element is deleted. We also need a way to provide assistive technology users with information that confirms that an element was deleted.

We're already tracking the number of elements in our list heading — the `<h2>` in `App.vue` — and it's associated with our list of to-do items. This makes it a reasonable place to move focus to when we delete a node.

First, we need to add a ref to our list heading. We also need to add a `tabindex="-1"` to it — this makes the element programmatically focusable (i.e., it can be focused via JavaScript), when by default it is not.

Inside `App.vue`, update your `<h2>` as follows:

```vue
<h2 id="list-summary" ref="listSummary" tabindex="-1">\{{listSummary}}</h2>
```

> [!NOTE]
> [`tabindex`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/tabindex) is a really powerful tool for handling certain accessibility problems. However, it should be used with caution. Over-using `tabindex="-1"` can cause problems for all sorts of users, so only use it exactly where you need to. You should also almost never use `tabindex` > = `0`, as it can cause problems for users since it can make the DOM flow and the tab-order mismatch, and/or add non-interactive elements to the tab order. This can be confusing to users, especially those using screen readers and other assistive technology.

Now that we have a `ref` and have let browsers know that we can programmatically focus the `<h2>`, we need to set focus on it. At the end of `deleteToDo()`, use the `listSummary` ref to set focus on the `<h2>`. Since the `<h2>` is always rendered in the app, you do not need to worry about using `$nextTick()` or lifecycle methods to handle focusing it.

```js
export default {
  // …
  methods: {
    // …
    deleteToDo(toDoId) {
      const itemIndex = this.ToDoItems.findIndex((item) => item.id === toDoId);
      this.ToDoItems.splice(itemIndex, 1);
      this.$refs.listSummary.focus();
    },
    // …
  },
  // …
};
```

Now, when you delete an item from your list, focus should be moved up to the list heading. This should provide a reasonable focus experience for all of our users.

At this point we've got a fully working component; we're now ready to add multiple `ToDoItem` components to our app. In this article we'll look at adding a set of todo item data to our `App.vue` component, which we'll then loop through and display inside `ToDoItem` components using the `v-for` directive.

          Vue components are written as a combination of JavaScript objects that
          manage the app's data and an HTML-based template syntax that maps to
          the underlying DOM structure. For installation, and to use some of the
          more advanced features of Vue (like Single File Components or render
          functions), you'll need a terminal with node + npm installed.

## Rendering lists with v-for

To be an effective to-do list, we need to be able to render multiple to-do items. To do that, Vue has a special directive, [`v-for`](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-directives.html#v-for). This is a built-in Vue directive that lets us include a loop inside of our template, repeating the rendering of a template feature for each item in an array. We'll use this to iterate through an array of to-do items and display them in our app in separate `ToDoItem` components.

### Adding some data to render

First we need to get an array of to-do items. To do that, we'll add a `data` property to the `App.vue` component object, containing a `ToDoItems` field whose value is an array of todo items. While we'll eventually add a mechanism to add new todo items, we can start with some mock to do items. Each to-do item will be represented by an object with a `label` and a `done` property.

Add a few sample to-do items, along the lines of those seen below. This way you have some data available for rendering using `v-for`.

```js
export default {
  name: "app",
  components: {
    ToDoItem,
  },
  data() {
    return {
      ToDoItems: [
        { label: "Learn Vue", done: false },
        { label: "Create a Vue project with the CLI", done: true },
        { label: "Have fun", done: true },
        { label: "Create a to-do list", done: false },
      ],
    };
  },
};
```

Now that we have a list of items, we can use the `v-for` directive to display them. Directives are applied to elements like other attributes. In case of `v-for`, you use a special syntax similar to a [`for...in`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in) loop in JavaScript — `v-for="item in items"` — where `items` is the array you want to iterate over, and `item` is a reference to the current element in the array.

`v-for` attaches to the element you want to repeat, and renders that element and its children. In this case, we want to display an `<li>` element for every to-do item inside our `ToDoItems` array. Then we want to pass the data from each to-do item to a `ToDoItem` component.

### Key attribute

Before we do that, there's one other piece of syntax to know about that is used with `v-for`, the `key` attribute. To help Vue optimize rendering the elements in the list, it tries to patch list elements so it's not recreating them every time the list changes. However, Vue needs help. To make sure it is re-using list elements appropriately, it needs a unique "key" on the same element that you attach `v-for` to.

To make sure that Vue can accurately compare the `key` attributes, they need to be string or numeric values. While it would be great to use the name field, this field will eventually be controlled by user input, which means we can't guarantee that the names would be unique. We can use `nanoid()`, however, as we did in the previous article.

1. Import `nanoid` into your `App` component in the same way you did with your `ToDoItem` component, using

   ```js
   import { nanoid } from "nanoid";
   ```

2. Next, add an `id` field to each element in your `ToDoItems` array, and assign each of them a value of `` `todo-${nanoid()}` ``.

   The `<script>` element in `App.vue` should now have the following contents:

   ```js
   import { nanoid } from "nanoid";
   import ToDoItem from "./components/ToDoItem.vue";

   export default {
     name: "app",
     components: {
       ToDoItem,
     },
     data() {
       return {
         ToDoItems: [
           { id: `todo-${nanoid()}`, label: "Learn Vue", done: false },
           {
             id: `todo-${nanoid()}`,
             label: "Create a Vue project with the CLI",
             done: true,
           },
           { id: `todo-${nanoid()}`, label: "Have fun", done: true },
           {
             id: `todo-${nanoid()}`,
             label: "Create a to-do list",
             done: false,
           },
         ],
       };
     },
   };
   ```

3. Now, add the `v-for` directive and `key` attribute to the `<li>` element in your `App.vue` template, like so:

   ```html
   <ul>
     <li v-for="item in ToDoItems" :key="item.id">
       <to-do-item label="My ToDo Item" :done="true"></to-do-item>
     </li>
   </ul>
   ```

   When you make this change, every JavaScript expression between the `<li>` tags will have access to the `item` value in addition to the other component attributes. This means we can pass the fields of our item objects to our `ToDoItem` component — just remember to use the `v-bind` syntax. This is really useful, as we want our todo items to display their `label` properties as their label, not a static label of "My Todo Item". In addition, we want their checked status to reflect their `done` properties, not always be set to `done="true"`.

4. Update the `label="My ToDo Item"` attribute to `:label="item.label"`, and the `:done="true"` attribute to `:done="item.done"`, as seen in context below:

   ```html
   <ul>
     <li v-for="item in ToDoItems" :key="item.id">
       <to-do-item :label="item.label" :done="item.done"></to-do-item>
     </li>
   </ul>
   ```

Now when you look at your running app, it'll show the todo items with their proper names, and if you inspect the source code you'll see that the inputs all have unique `id`s, taken from the object in the `App` component.

![The app with a list of todo items rendered.](rendered-todo-items.png)

## Chance for a slight refactor

There's one little bit of refactoring we can do here. Instead of generating the `id` for the checkboxes inside your `ToDoItem` component, we can turn the `id` into a prop. While this isn't strictly necessary, it makes it easier for us to manage since we already need to create a unique `id` for each todo item anyway.

1. Add a new prop to your `ToDoItem` component — `id`.
2. Make it required, and make its type a `String`.
3. To prevent name collisions, remove the `id` field from your `data` attribute.
4. You are no longer using `nanoid`, so you need to remove the `import { nanoid } from 'nanoid';` line, otherwise your app will throw an error.

The `<script>` contents in your `ToDoItem` component should now look something like this:

```js
export default {
  props: {
    label: { required: true, type: String },
    done: { default: false, type: Boolean },
    id: { required: true, type: String },
  },
  data() {
    return {
      isDone: this.done,
    };
  },
};
```

Now, over in your `App.vue` component, pass `item.id` as a prop to the `ToDoItem` component. Your `App.vue` template should now look like this:

```html
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <h1>My To-Do List</h1>
    <ul>
      <li v-for="item in ToDoItems" :key="item.id">
        <to-do-item
          :label="item.label"
          :done="item.done"
          :id="item.id"></to-do-item>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</template>
```

When you look at your rendered site, it should look the same, but our refactor now means that our `id` is being taken from the data inside `App.vue` and passed into `ToDoItem` as a prop, just like everything else, so things are now more logical and consistent.

## Summary

And that brings us to the end of another article. We now have sample data in place, and a loop that takes each bit of data and renders it inside a `ToDoItem` in our app.

What we really need next is the ability to allow our users to enter their own todo items into the app, and for that we'll need a text `<input>`, an event to fire when the data is submitted, a method to fire upon submission to add the data and rerender the list, and a model to control the data. We'll get to these in the next article.

## Further resources

Here's where you should go to learn more about Vue:

- [Vue Docs](https://vuejs.org/) — The main Vue site. Contains comprehensive documentation, including examples, cookbooks, and reference material. This is the best place to start learning Vue in depth.
- [Vue GitHub Repo](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) — The Vue code itself. This is where you can report issues and/or contribute directly to the Vue codebase. Studying the Vue source code can help you better understand how the framework works, and write better code.
- [Vue Discussions](https://github.com/vuejs/core/discussions) — The official forum for getting help with Vue.
- [Vue CLI Docs](https://cli.vuejs.org/) — Documentation for the Vue CLI. This contains information on customizing and extending the output you are generating via the CLI.
- [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) — Nuxt is a Server-Side Vue Framework, with some architectural opinions that can be useful to creating maintainable applications, even if you don't use any of the Server Side Rendering features it provides. This site provides detailed documentation on using Nuxt.
- [Vue Mastery](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/) — A paid education platform that specializes in Vue, including some free lessons.
- [Vue School](https://vueschool.io/) — Another paid education platform specializing in Vue.

## Building and publishing your Vue app

The Vue CLI also provides us with tools for preparing our app for publishing to the web. You can do this like so:

- If your local server is still running, end it by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> \+ <kbd>C</kbd> in the terminal.

- Next, run the `npm run build` (or `yarn build`) in the console.

This will create a new `dist` directory containing all of your production ready files. To publish your site to the web, copy the contents of this folder to your hosting environment.

> [!NOTE]
> The Vue CLI docs also include a [specific guide on how to publish your app](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/deployment.html#platform-guides) to many of the common hosting platforms.

## Vue 2

Vue 2 support will end on December 31st, 2023 and the default Vue version for all CLI tools will be version 3 and above.
The [Composition API](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/composition-api-faq.html) works as an alternative to the property-based API where a `setup()` function is used on the component. Only what you return from this function is available in your `<template>`s. You are required to be explicit about "reactive" properties when using this API. Vue handles this for you using the [Options API](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/composition-api-faq.html#trade-offs). This makes the new API typically considered a more advanced use case.

If you're upgrading from Vue 2, it's recommended you take a look at the [Vue 3 migration guide](https://v3-migration.vuejs.org/).

## Styling Vue components with CSS

Before we move on to add more advanced features to our app, we should add some basic CSS to make it look better. Vue has three common approaches to styling apps:

- External CSS files.
- Global styles in Single File Components (`.vue` files).
- Component-scoped styles in Single File Components.

To help familiarize you with each one, we'll use a combination of all three to give our app a nicer look and feel.

## Styling with external CSS files

You can include external CSS files and apply them globally to your app. Let's look at how this is done.

To start with, create a file called `reset.css` in the `src/assets` directory. Files in this folder get processed by webpack. This means we can use CSS pre-processors (like SCSS) or post-processors (like PostCSS).

While this tutorial will not be using such tools, it's good to know that when including such code in the assets folder it will be processed automatically.

Add the following contents to the `reset.css` file:

```css
/* reset.css */
/* RESETS */
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
*:focus {
  outline: 3px dashed #228bec;
}
html {
  font: 62.5% / 1.15 sans-serif;
}
h1,
h2 {
  margin-bottom: 0;
}
ul {
  list-style: none;
  padding: 0;
}
button {
  border: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  width: auto;
  overflow: visible;
  background: transparent;
  color: inherit;
  font: inherit;
  line-height: normal;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: inherit;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: inherit;
  appearance: none;
}
button::-moz-focus-inner {
  border: 0;
}
button,
input,
optgroup,
select,
textarea {
  font-family: inherit;
  font-size: 100%;
  line-height: 1.15;
  margin: 0;
}
button,
input {
  /* 1 */
  overflow: visible;
}
input[type="text"] {
  border-radius: 0;
}
body {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 68rem;
  margin: 0 auto;
  font:
    1.6rem/1.25 "Helvetica Neue",
    "Helvetica",
    "Arial",
    sans-serif;
  background-color: whitesmoke;
  color: #4d4d4d;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
}
@media screen and (width >= 620px) {
  body {
    font-size: 1.9rem;
    line-height: 1.31579;
  }
}
/* END RESETS */
```

Next, in your `src/main.js` file, import the `reset.css` file like so:

```js
import "./assets/reset.css";
```

This will cause the file to get picked up during the build step and automatically added to our site.

The reset styles should be applied to the app now. The images below show the look of the app before and after the reset is applied.

Before:

After:

![the todo app with partial styling added; the app is now in a card, but some of the internal features still need styling](todo-app-reset-styles.png)

Noticeable changes include the removal of the list bullets, background color changes, and changes to the base button and input styles.

## Adding global styles to Single File Components

Now that we've reset our CSS to be uniform across browsers, we need to customize the styles a bit more. There are some styles that we want to apply across components in our app. While adding these files directly to the `reset.css` stylesheet would work, we'll instead add them to the `<style>` tags in `App.vue` to demonstrate how this can be used.

There are already some styles present in the file. Let's remove those and replace them with the styles below. These styles do a few things — adding some styling to buttons and inputs, and customizing the `#app` element and its children.

Update your `App.vue` file's `<style>` element so it looks like so:

```vue
<style>
/* Global styles */
.btn {
  padding: 0.8rem 1rem 0.7rem;
  border: 0.2rem solid #4d4d4d;
  cursor: pointer;
  text-transform: capitalize;
}
.btn__danger {
  color: white;
  background-color: #ca3c3c;
  border-color: #bd2130;
}
.btn__filter {
  border-color: lightgrey;
}
.btn__danger:focus {
  outline-color: #c82333;
}
.btn__primary {
  color: white;
  background-color: black;
}
.btn-group {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
.btn-group > * {
  flex: 1 1 auto;
}
.btn-group > * + * {
  margin-left: 0.8rem;
}
.label-wrapper {
  margin: 0;
  flex: 0 0 100%;
  text-align: center;
}
[class*="__lg"] {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 100%;
  font-size: 1.9rem;
}
[class*="__lg"]:not(:last-child) {
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
@media screen and (width >= 620px) {
  [class*="__lg"] {
    font-size: 2.4rem;
  }
}
.visually-hidden {
  position: absolute;
  height: 1px;
  width: 1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
  clip-path: rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);
  white-space: nowrap;
}
[class*="stack"] > * {
  margin-top: 0;
  margin-bottom: 0;
}
.stack-small > * + * {
  margin-top: 1.25rem;
}
.stack-large > * + * {
  margin-top: 2.5rem;
}
@media screen and (width >= 550px) {
  .stack-small > * + * {
    margin-top: 1.4rem;
  }
  .stack-large > * + * {
    margin-top: 2.8rem;
  }
}
/* End global styles */
#app {
  background: white;
  margin: 2rem 0 4rem 0;
  padding: 1rem;
  padding-top: 0;
  position: relative;
  box-shadow:
    0 2px 4px 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 20%),
    0 2.5rem 5rem 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 10%);
}
@media screen and (width >= 550px) {
  #app {
    padding: 4rem;
  }
}
#app > * {
  max-width: 50rem;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
}
#app > form {
  max-width: 100%;
}
#app h1 {
  display: block;
  min-width: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  text-align: center;
  margin: 0;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
</style>
```

If you check the app, you'll see that our todo list is now in a card, and we have some better formatting of our to-do items. Now we can go through and begin editing our components to use some of these styles.

![the todo app with partial styling added; the app is now in a card, but some of the internal features still need styling](todo-app-partial-styles.png)

### Adding CSS classes in Vue

We should apply the button CSS classes to the `<button>` in our `ToDoForm` component. Since Vue templates are valid HTML, this is done in the same way to how you might do it in plain HTML — by adding a `class=""` attribute to the element.

Add `class="btn btn__primary btn__lg"` to your form's `<button>` element:

```html
<button type="submit" class="btn btn__primary btn__lg">Add</button>
```

While we're here, there's one more semantic and styling change we can make. Since our form denotes a specific section of our page, it could benefit from an `<h2>` element. The label, however, already denotes the purpose of the form. To avoid repeating ourselves, let's wrap our label in an `<h2>`. There are a few other global CSS styles which we can add as well. We'll also add the `input__lg` class to our `<input>` element.

Update your `ToDoForm` template so that it looks like this:

```html
<template>
  <form @submit.prevent="onSubmit">
    <h2 class="label-wrapper">
      <label for="new-todo-input" class="label__lg">
        What needs to be done?
      </label>
    </h2>
    <input
      type="text"
      id="new-todo-input"
      name="new-todo"
      autocomplete="off"
      v-model.lazy.trim="label"
      class="input__lg" />
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn__primary btn__lg">Add</button>
  </form>
</template>
```

Let's also add the `stack-large` class to the `<ul>` tag in our `App.vue` file. This will help improve the spacing of our to-do items a bit.

Update it as follows:

```html
<ul aria-labelledby="list-summary" class="stack-large">
  …
</ul>
```

## Adding scoped styles

The last component we want to style is our `ToDoItem` component. To keep the style definitions close to the component we can add a `<style>` element inside it. However, if these styles alter things outside of this component, it could be challenging to track down the styles responsible, and fix the problem. This is where the `scoped` attribute can be useful — this attaches a unique HTML `data` attribute selector to all of your styles, preventing them from colliding globally.

To use the `scoped` modifier, create a `<style>` element inside `ToDoItem.vue`, at the bottom of the file, and give it a `scoped` attribute:

```vue
<style scoped>
/* … */
</style>
```

Next, copy the following CSS into the newly created `<style>` element:

```css
.custom-checkbox > .checkbox-label {
  font-family: "Arial", sans-serif;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-size: 1rem;
  line-height: 1.25;
  color: #0b0c0c;
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
}
.custom-checkbox > .checkbox {
  font-family: "Arial", sans-serif;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-size: 1rem;
  line-height: 1.25;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  width: 100%;
  height: 2.5rem;
  margin-top: 0;
  padding: 5px;
  border: 2px solid #0b0c0c;
  border-radius: 0;
  appearance: none;
}
.custom-checkbox > input:focus {
  outline: 3px dashed #ffdd00;
  outline-offset: 0;
  box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 2px;
}
.custom-checkbox {
  font-family: "Arial", sans-serif;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-size: 1.6rem;
  line-height: 1.25;
  display: block;
  position: relative;
  min-height: 40px;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  padding-left: 40px;
  clear: left;
}
.custom-checkbox > input[type="checkbox"] {
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  cursor: pointer;
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 1;
  top: -2px;
  left: -2px;
  width: 44px;
  height: 44px;
  margin: 0;
  opacity: 0;
}
.custom-checkbox > .checkbox-label {
  font-size: inherit;
  font-family: inherit;
  line-height: inherit;
  display: inline-block;
  margin-bottom: 0;
  padding: 8px 15px 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
  touch-action: manipulation;
}
.custom-checkbox > label::before {
  content: "";
  box-sizing: border-box;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 40px;
  height: 40px;
  border: 2px solid currentColor;
  background: transparent;
}
.custom-checkbox > input[type="checkbox"]:focus + label::before {
  border-width: 4px;
  outline: 3px dashed #228bec;
}
.custom-checkbox > label::after {
  box-sizing: content-box;
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  top: 11px;
  left: 9px;
  width: 18px;
  height: 7px;
  transform: rotate(-45deg);
  border: solid;
  border-width: 0 0 5px 5px;
  border-top-color: transparent;
  opacity: 0;
  background: transparent;
}
.custom-checkbox > input[type="checkbox"]:checked + label::after {
  opacity: 1;
}
@media only screen and (width >= 40rem) {
  label,
  input,
  .custom-checkbox {
    font-size: 1.9rem;
    line-height: 1.31579;
  }
}
```

Now we need to add some CSS classes to our template to connect the styles.

To the root `<div>`, add a `custom-checkbox` class. To the `<input>`, add a `checkbox` class. Last of all, to the `<label>` add a `checkbox-label` class. The updated template is below:

```html
<template>
  <div class="custom-checkbox">
    <input type="checkbox" :id="id" :checked="isDone" class="checkbox" />
    <label :for="id" class="checkbox-label">\{{label}}</label>
  </div>
</template>
```

The app should now have custom checkboxes. Your app should look something like the screenshot below.

![the todo app with complete styling. The input form is now styled properly, and the todo items now have spacing and custom checkboxes](todo-app-complete-styles.png)

## Summary

Our work is done on the styling of our sample app. In the next article we'll return to adding some more functionality to our app, namely using a computed property to add a count of completed todo items to our app.

# Core learning modules

Our **Core modules** cover topics that we feel every web developer should have a good grounding in. This includes all the information they need to design and build a basic, accessible web app that follows modern best practices, and manage and deploy their code using appropriate tools.

## Prerequisites

While there is no prerequisite knowledge for starting this set of modules, we would recommend that you familiarize yourself with your computer, make sure you've got a basic set of required applications installed (such as web browsers and a code editor), and do some background reading on the web and web technologies, if you have not already done so. All these topics are covered in our [Getting started modules](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started).

In particular, if you've never done any coding before, we'd recommend the [Your first website](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website) module, which introduces you web technologies very gently and takes you through the process of building a simple website.

## Modules

- [Structuring content with HTML](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content)
  - : To build a high-quality, usable, accessible website, you need to understand how to define your content structure using semantic HTML. This module covers the basics of the HTML language, before looking at key areas such as document structure, links, lists, images, forms, and more.
- [CSS styling basics](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics)
  - : CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides all the CSS fundamentals you'll need for now, including syntax, features, and techniques.
- [CSS text styling](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Text_styling)
  - : With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate on is styling text — one of the most common things you'll do with CSS. Here we look at fundamentals including setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows, and other text features. We round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and links.
- [CSS layout](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout)
  - : In previous modules we looked at how to style and manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to correctly lay out your boxes in relation to one another, and the browser viewport. This module looks at floats, positioning, other modern layout tools, and building responsive designs that will adapt to different devices, screen sizes, and resolutions.
- [Dynamic scripting with JavaScript](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting)
  - : JavaScript is a huge topic, with so many different features, styles, and techniques to learn, and so many APIs and tools built on top of it. This module focuses mostly on the essentials of the core language, plus some key surrounding topics — learning these topics will give you a solid basis to work from.
- [JavaScript frameworks and libraries](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Frameworks_libraries)
  - : JavaScript frameworks are an essential part of modern front-end web development, providing developers with tried and tested tools for building scalable, interactive web applications. Many modern companies use frameworks as a standard part of their tooling, so many front-end development jobs now require framework experience. In this set of articles, we aim to give you a comfortable starting point to help you begin learning frameworks.
- [Accessibility](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility)
  - : Access to web content such as public services, education, e-commerce sites, and entertainment is a human right. No one should be excluded based on disability, race, geography, or other human characteristics. This module discusses the best practices and techniques you should learn to make your websites as accessible as possible.
- [Design for developers](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Design_for_developers)
  - : The idea of this module is to (re-)introduce developers to design thinking. They may not want to work as designers, but having some basic user experience and design theory is good for everyone involved in building websites, no matter what their role. At the very least, even the most technical, "non-designer" developer should understand design briefs, why things are designed as they are, and be able to get into the mindset of the user. And it'll help them make their portfolios look better.
- [Version control](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Version_control)
  - : Version control tools are an essential part of modern workflows, for backing up and collaborating on codebases. This module takes you through the essentials of version control using Git and GitHub.

# A first splash into JavaScript

{{PreviousMenuNext("Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/What_is_JavaScript", "Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/What_went_wrong", "Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting")}}

Now you've learned something about the theory of JavaScript and what you can do with it, we are going to give you an idea of what the process of creating a simple JavaScript program is like, by guiding you through a practical tutorial. Here you'll build up a simple "Guess the number" game, step by step.

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Prerequisites:</th>
      <td>An understanding of <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content">HTML</a> and the <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics">fundamentals of CSS</a>.</td>

          <li>Experience of what writing JavaScript is like.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

We want to set really clear expectations here: You won't be expected to learn JavaScript by the end of this article, or even understand all the code we are asking you to write. Instead, we want to give you an idea of how JavaScript's features work together, and what writing JavaScript feels like. In subsequent articles you'll revisit all the features shown here in a lot more detail, so don't worry if you don't understand it all immediately!

> [!NOTE]
> Many of the code features you'll see in JavaScript are the same as in other programming languages — functions, loops, etc. The code syntax looks different, but the concepts are still largely the same.

## Introducing our "Number guessing game" example

In this article we'll show you how to build up the game you can see below:

```html hidden live-sample___guess-the-number
<h1>Number guessing game</h1>

<p>
  We have selected a random number between 1 and 100. See if you can guess it in
  10 turns or fewer. We'll tell you if your guess was too high or too low.
</p>

<div class="form">
  <label for="guessField">Enter a guess: </label>
  <input
    type="number"
    min="1"
    max="100"
    required
    id="guessField"
    class="guessField" />
  <input type="submit" value="Submit guess" class="guessSubmit" />
</div>

<div class="resultParas">
  <p class="guesses"></p>
  <p class="lastResult"></p>
  <p class="lowOrHi"></p>
</div>
```

```css hidden live-sample___guess-the-number
html {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

body {
  width: 50%;
  max-width: 800px;
  min-width: 480px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

.form input[type="number"] {
  width: 200px;
}

.lastResult {
  color: white;
  padding: 3px;
}
```

```js hidden live-sample___guess-the-number
let randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
const guesses = document.querySelector(".guesses");
const lastResult = document.querySelector(".lastResult");
const lowOrHi = document.querySelector(".lowOrHi");
const guessSubmit = document.querySelector(".guessSubmit");
const guessField = document.querySelector(".guessField");
let guessCount = 1;
let resetButton;

function checkGuess() {
  const userGuess = Number(guessField.value);
  if (guessCount === 1) {
    guesses.textContent = "Previous guesses: ";
  }

  guesses.textContent = `${guesses.textContent} ${userGuess}`;

  if (userGuess === randomNumber) {
    lastResult.textContent = "Congratulations! You got it right!";
    lastResult.style.backgroundColor = "green";
    lowOrHi.textContent = "";
    setGameOver();
  } else if (guessCount === 10) {
    lastResult.textContent = "!!!GAME OVER!!!";
    lowOrHi.textContent = "";
    setGameOver();
  } else {
    lastResult.textContent = "Wrong!";
    lastResult.style.backgroundColor = "red";
    if (userGuess < randomNumber) {
      lowOrHi.textContent = "Last guess was too low!";
    } else if (userGuess > randomNumber) {
      lowOrHi.textContent = "Last guess was too high!";
    }
  }

  guessCount++;
  guessField.value = "";
  guessField.focus();
}

guessSubmit.addEventListener("click", checkGuess);

function setGameOver() {
  guessField.disabled = true;
  guessSubmit.disabled = true;
  resetButton = document.createElement("button");
  resetButton.textContent = "Start new game";
  document.body.appendChild(resetButton);
  resetButton.addEventListener("click", resetGame);
}

function resetGame() {
  guessCount = 1;
  const resetParas = document.querySelectorAll(".resultParas p");
  for (const resetPara of resetParas) {
    resetPara.textContent = "";
  }

  resetButton.parentNode.removeChild(resetButton);
  guessField.disabled = false;
  guessSubmit.disabled = false;
  guessField.value = "";
  guessField.focus();
  lastResult.style.backgroundColor = "white";
  randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
}
```

Have a go at playing it — familiarize yourself with the game before you move on.

## Thinking like a programmer

One of the hardest things to learn in programming is not the syntax you need to learn, but how to apply it to solve real-world problems. You need to start thinking like a programmer — this generally involves looking at descriptions of what your program needs to do, working out what code features are needed to achieve those things, and how to make them work together.

This requires a mixture of hard work, experience with the programming syntax, and practice — plus a bit of creativity. The more you code, the better you'll get at it. We can't promise that you'll develop "programmer brain" in five minutes, but we will give you plenty of opportunities to practice thinking like a programmer here, and throughout the rest of the course.

## The initial design brief

Let's imagine your boss has given you the following brief for creating this game:

> I want you to create a simple "guess the number" type game. It should choose a random number between 1 and 100, then challenge the player to guess the number in 10 turns. After each turn, the player should be told if they are right or wrong, and if they are wrong, whether the guess was too low or too high. It should also tell the player what numbers they previously guessed. The game will end once the player guesses correctly, or once they run out of turns. When the game ends, the player should be given an option to start playing again.

Upon looking at this brief, the first thing we can do is to start breaking it down into simple actionable tasks, in as much of a programmer mindset as possible:

1. Generate a random number between 1 and 100.
2. Record the turn number the player is on. Start it on 1.
3. Provide the player with a way to guess what the number is.
4. Once a guess has been submitted first record it somewhere so the user can see their previous guesses.
5. Next, check whether it is the correct number.
6. If it is correct:
   1. Display congratulations message.
   2. Stop the player from being able to enter more guesses (this would mess the game up).
   3. Display control allowing the player to restart the game.

7. If it is wrong and the player has turns left:
   1. Tell the player they are wrong and whether their guess was too high or too low.
   2. Allow them to enter another guess.
   3. Increment the turn number by 1.

8. If it is wrong and the player has no turns left:
   1. Tell the player it is game over.
   2. Stop the player from being able to enter more guesses (this would mess the game up).
   3. Display control allowing the player to restart the game.

9. Once the game restarts, make sure the game logic and UI are completely reset, then go back to step 1.

Let's now move forward, looking at how we can turn these steps into code, building up the example, and exploring JavaScript features as we go.

## Initial setup

To begin this tutorial, we'd like you to make a local copy of the following code in a new HTML file using your code editor.

    <h1>Number guessing game</h1>

    <p>
      We have selected a random number between 1 and 100. See if you can guess
      it in 10 turns or fewer. We'll tell you if your guess was too high or too
      low.
    </p>

    <div class="form">
      <label for="guessField">Enter a guess: </label>
      <input
        type="number"
        min="1"
        max="100"
        required
        id="guessField"
        class="guessField" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit guess" class="guessSubmit" />
    </div>

    <div class="resultParas">
      <p class="guesses"></p>
      <p class="lastResult"></p>
      <p class="lowOrHi"></p>
    </div>

    <script>
      // Your JavaScript goes here
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Keep it open in your text editor, and also open it in your web browser. At the moment you'll see a simple heading, paragraph of instructions and form for entering a guess, but the form won't currently do anything.

You'll be adding all your JavaScript code inside the {{htmlelement("script")}} element at the bottom of the HTML:

```html
<script>
  // Your JavaScript goes here
</script>
```

## Adding variables to store our data

Let's get started. First of all, add the following lines inside your {{htmlelement("script")}} element:

```js
let randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;

const guesses = document.querySelector(".guesses");
const lastResult = document.querySelector(".lastResult");
const lowOrHi = document.querySelector(".lowOrHi");

const guessSubmit = document.querySelector(".guessSubmit");
const guessField = document.querySelector(".guessField");

let guessCount = 1;
let resetButton;
```

This section of the code sets up the variables (and constants) we need to store the data our program will use.

Variables are basically names for values (such as numbers, or strings of text). You create a variable with the keyword `let` followed by a name for your variable.

Constants are also used to name values, but unlike variables, you can't change the value once set. In this case, we are using constants to store references to parts of our user interface. The text inside some of these elements might change, but each constant always references the same HTML element that it was initialized with. You create a constant with the keyword `const` followed by a name for the constant.

You can assign a value to a variable or constant with an equals sign (`=`) followed by the value you want to give it.

In our example:

- The first variable — `randomNumber` — is assigned a random number between 1 and 100, calculated using a mathematical algorithm.
- The first three constants are each made to store a reference to the results paragraphs in our HTML, and are used to insert values into the paragraphs later on in the code (note how they are inside a `<div>` element, which is itself used to select all three later on for resetting, when we restart the game):

  ```html
  <div class="resultParas">
    <p class="guesses"></p>
    <p class="lastResult"></p>
    <p class="lowOrHi"></p>
  </div>
  ```

- The next two constants store references to the form text input and submit button and are used to handle submitting the guess later on.

  ```html
  <label for="guessField">Enter a guess: </label>
  <input type="number" id="guessField" class="guessField" />
  <input type="submit" value="Submit guess" class="guessSubmit" />
  ```

- Our final two variables store a guess count of 1 (used to keep track of how many guesses the player has had), and a reference to a reset button that doesn't exist yet (but will later).

## Functions

Next, add the following below your previous JavaScript:

```js
function checkGuess() {
  console.log("I am a placeholder");
}
```

Functions are reusable blocks of code that you can write once and run again and again, saving the need to keep repeating code over and over again. There are several ways to define functions, but for now we'll concentrate on one simple type. Here we have defined a function by using the keyword `function`, followed by a name, with parentheses put after it. After that, we put two curly braces (`{ }`). Inside the curly braces goes all the code that we want to run whenever we call the function.

When we want to run the code, we type the name of the function followed by the parentheses.

Let's try that now. Save your code and refresh the page in your browser. Then go into the [developer tools JavaScript console](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools), and enter the following line:

```js
checkGuess();
```

After pressing <kbd>Return</kbd>/<kbd>Enter</kbd>, you should see `I am a placeholder` logged to the console; we have defined a function in our code that outputs a placeholder message whenever we call it.

## Text strings

Strings are used for representing text. We've already seen a string variable: in the following code, `"I am a placeholder"` is a string:

```js
function checkGuess() {
  console.log("I am a placeholder");
}
```

You can declare strings using double quotes (`"`) or single quotes (`'`), but you must use the same form for the start and end of a single string declaration: you can't write `"I am a placeholder'`.

You can also declare strings using backticks (`` ` ``). Strings declared like this are called _template literals_ and have some special properties. In particular, you can embed other variables or even expressions in them:

```js
const name = "Mahalia";

const greeting = `Hello ${name}`;
```

This gives you a mechanism to join strings together.

## Conditionals

**Conditional** code blocks allows you to run code selectively, depending on whether a certain condition is true or not. They look a bit like a function, but they are different. Let's explore conditionals by adding to our example.

I think it's safe to say that we don't want our `checkGuess()` function to just spit out a placeholder message. We want it to check whether a player's guess is correct or not, and respond appropriately.

At this point, replace your current `checkGuess()` function with this version instead:

```js
function checkGuess() {
  const userGuess = Number(guessField.value);
  if (guessCount === 1) {
    guesses.textContent = "Previous guesses:";
  }
  guesses.textContent = `${guesses.textContent} ${userGuess}`;

  if (userGuess === randomNumber) {
    lastResult.textContent = "Congratulations! You got it right!";
    lastResult.style.backgroundColor = "green";
    lowOrHi.textContent = "";
    setGameOver();
  } else if (guessCount === 10) {
    lastResult.textContent = "!!!GAME OVER!!!";
    lowOrHi.textContent = "";
    setGameOver();
  } else {
    lastResult.textContent = "Wrong!";
    lastResult.style.backgroundColor = "red";
    if (userGuess < randomNumber) {
      lowOrHi.textContent = "Last guess was too low!";
    } else if (userGuess > randomNumber) {
      lowOrHi.textContent = "Last guess was too high!";
    }
  }

  guessCount++;
  guessField.value = "";
  guessField.focus();
}
```

This is a lot of code — phew! Let's go through each section and explain what it does.

- The first line declares a constant called `userGuess` and sets its value to the current value entered inside the text field. We also run this value through the built-in `Number()` constructor, just to make sure the value is definitely a number.
- Next, we encounter our first conditional code block. The simplest form of conditional block starts with the keyword `if`, then some parentheses, then some curly braces. Inside the parentheses, we include a test. If the test returns `true`, we run the code inside the curly braces. If not, we don't, and move on to the next bit of code. In this case, we test whether the `guessCount` variable is equal to `1` (that is, whether this is the player's first go or not):

  ```js
  guessCount === 1;
  ```

  If it is, we make the guesses paragraph's text content equal to `Previous guesses:`. If not, we don't.

- Next, we use a template literal to append the current `userGuess` value onto the end of the `guesses` paragraph, with a blank space in between.
- The next block does a few checks:
  - The first `if (){ }` checks whether the user's guess is equal to the `randomNumber` set at the top of our JavaScript. If it is, the player has guessed correctly and the game is won, so we show the player a congratulations message with a nice green color, clear the contents of the Low/High guess information box, and run a function called `setGameOver()`, which we'll discuss later.
  - Now we've chained another test onto the end of the last one using an `else if (){ }` structure. This one checks whether this turn is the user's last turn. If it is, the program does the same thing as in the previous block, except with a game over message instead of a congratulations message.
  - The final block chained onto the end of this code (the `else { }`) contains code that is only run if neither of the other two tests returns true (the player didn't guess correctly, but they have more guesses left). In this case we tell them they are wrong, then we perform another conditional test to check whether the guess was higher or lower than the answer, displaying a further message as appropriate to tell them higher or lower.

- The last three lines in the function get us ready for the next guess to be submitted. We add 1 to the `guessCount` variable so the player uses up their turn (`++` is an increment operation — increase by 1), and empty the value out of the form text field and focus it again, ready for the next guess to be entered.

## Events

At this point, we have a nicely implemented `checkGuess()` function, but it won't do anything because we haven't called it yet. Ideally, we want to call it when the "Submit guess" button is pressed, and to do this we need to use an **event**. Events are things that happen in the browser — a button being clicked, a page loading, a video playing, etc. — in response to which we can run blocks of code. **Event listeners** observe specific events and call **event handler functions**, which run in response to an event firing.

Add the following line below your `checkGuess()` function:

```js
guessSubmit.addEventListener("click", checkGuess);
```

Here we are adding an event listener to the `guessSubmit` button. This is a method that takes two input values (called _arguments_) — the type of event we are listening out for (in this case `click`) as a string, and the function we want to run when the event occurs (in this case, `checkGuess()`). Note that we don't need to specify the parentheses when writing it inside {{domxref("EventTarget.addEventListener", "addEventListener()")}}.

Try saving and refreshing your code now, and your example should work — to a point. The only problem now is that if you guess the correct answer or run out of guesses, the game will break because we've not yet defined the `setGameOver()` function that is supposed to be run once the game is over. Let's add our missing code now and complete the example functionality.

## Finishing the game functionality

Let's add the `setGameOver()` function to the bottom of our code and then walk through it. Add this now, below the rest of your JavaScript:

```js
function setGameOver() {
  guessField.disabled = true;
  guessSubmit.disabled = true;
  resetButton = document.createElement("button");
  resetButton.textContent = "Start new game";
  document.body.append(resetButton);
  resetButton.addEventListener("click", resetGame);
}
```

- The first two lines disable the form text input and button by setting their `disabled` properties to `true`. This is necessary, because if we didn't, the user could submit more guesses after the game is over, which would mess things up.
- The next three lines generate a new {{htmlelement("button")}} element, set its text label to "Start new game", and add it to the bottom of our existing HTML.
- The final line sets an event listener on our new button so that when it is clicked, a function called `resetGame()` is run.

Now we need to define `resetGame()` too! Add the following code, again to the bottom of your JavaScript:

```js
function resetGame() {
  guessCount = 1;

  const resetParas = document.querySelectorAll(".resultParas p");
  for (const resetPara of resetParas) {
    resetPara.textContent = "";
  }

  resetButton.parentNode.removeChild(resetButton);

  guessField.disabled = false;
  guessSubmit.disabled = false;
  guessField.value = "";
  guessField.focus();

  lastResult.style.backgroundColor = "white";

  randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
}
```

This rather long block of code completely resets everything to how it was at the start of the game, so the player can have another go.

Specifically, it:

- Sets the `guessCount` back to 1.
- Empties all the text out of the information paragraphs. We select all paragraphs inside `<div class="resultParas"></div>`, then loop through each one, setting their `textContent` to `""` (an empty string).
- Removes the reset button from our code.
- Re-enables the form elements, and empties and focuses the text field, ready for a new guess to be entered.
- Removes the background color from the `lastResult` paragraph.
- Generates a new random number so that you are not just guessing the same number again!

**At this point, you should have a basic fully working game — congratulations!**

All we have left to do now in this article is to talk about a few other important code features that you've already seen, although you may have not realized it.

## Loops

Above, we mentioned **Loops**, a very important concept in programming, which allow you to keep running a piece of code over and over again, until a certain condition is met.

Let's explore a basic example to show you with this means. Go to your [browser developer tools JavaScript console](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools) again, paste the following code into it, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>/<kbd>Return</kbd>:

```js
const fruits = ["apples", "bananas", "cherries"];
for (const fruit of fruits) {
  console.log(fruit);
}
```

What happened? The strings `'apples', 'bananas', 'cherries'` were printed out in your console.

This is because of the loop. The line `const fruits = ['apples', 'bananas', 'cherries'];` creates an array, which is a collection of values (in this case strings).

We then use a [`for...of`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of) loop to get each item in the array and run some JavaScript on it. The line `for (const fruit of fruits)` says:

1. Get the first value in `fruits` and store it in a variable called `fruit`.
2. Run the code between the `{}` curly braces (which in this case, logs the `fruit` value to the console).
3. Store the next array value in `fruit`, and repeat 2, until you reach the end of the `fruits` array.

Now let's look at the loop in our number guessing game — the following can be found inside the `resetGame()` function:

```js
const resetParas = document.querySelectorAll(".resultParas p");
for (const resetPara of resetParas) {
  resetPara.textContent = "";
}
```

This code creates a variable containing a list of all the paragraphs inside `<div class="resultParas">` using the {{domxref("Document.querySelectorAll", "querySelectorAll()")}} method, then it loops through each one, removing the text content of each.

Note that even though `resetPara` is a constant, we can change its internal properties like `textContent`.

## Summary

So that's it for building the example. You got to the end — well done! Try your final code out, or [play with our finished version here](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/introduction-to-js-1/first-splash/number-guessing-game.html). If you can't get your version of the example to work, check it against the [source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/introduction-to-js-1/first-splash/number-guessing-game.html).

The next lesson may also help — in it, we discuss what can go wrong when writing JavaScript code, referring back to the "Guess the number" game in the process.

Here we look at why this is useful, then explore how to create an [array](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array), retrieve, add, and remove items stored in an array, and more besides.

## What is an array?

Arrays are generally described as "list-like objects"; they are basically single objects that contain multiple values stored in a list. Array objects can be stored in variables and dealt with in much the same way as any other type of value, the difference being that we can access each value inside the list individually, and do super useful and efficient things with the list, like loop through it and do the same thing to every value. Maybe we've got a series of product items and their prices stored in an array, and we want to loop through them all and print them out on an invoice, while totaling all the prices together and printing out the total price at the bottom.

If we didn't have arrays, we'd have to store every item in a separate variable, then call the code that does the printing and adding separately for each item. This would be much longer to write out, less efficient, and more error-prone. If we had 10 items to add to the invoice it would already be annoying, but what about 100 items, or 1000? We'll return to this example later on in the article.

As in previous articles, let's learn about the real basics of arrays by entering some examples into [browser developer console](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools).

> [!NOTE]
> Scrimba's [Aside: Intro to arrays](https://scrimba.com/the-frontend-developer-career-path-c0j/~06e?via=mdn) scrim <sup>[_MDN learning partner_](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Learning_content#partner_links_and_embeds)</sup> provides a useful interactive introduction to arrays with example walkthroughs and a challenge to test your knowledge.

## Creating arrays

Arrays consist of square brackets and items that are separated by commas.

1. Suppose we want to store a shopping list in an array. Paste the following code into the console:

   ```js
   const shopping = ["bread", "milk", "cheese", "hummus", "noodles"];
   console.log(shopping);
   ```

2. In the above example, each item is a string, but in an array we can store various data types — strings, numbers, objects, and even other arrays. We can also mix data types in a single array — we do not have to limit ourselves to storing only numbers in one array, and in another only strings. For example:

   ```js
   const sequence = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13];
   const random = ["tree", 795, [0, 1, 2]];
   ```

3. Before proceeding, create a few example arrays.

## Finding the length of an array

You can find out the length of an array (how many items are in it) in exactly the same way as you find out the length (in characters) of a string — by using the {{jsxref("Array.prototype.length","length")}} property. Try the following:

```js
const shopping = ["bread", "milk", "cheese", "hummus", "noodles"];
console.log(shopping.length); // 5
```

## Accessing and modifying array items

Arrays are [indexed collections](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Indexed_collections). Items in an array are numbered, starting from zero. This number is called the item's _index_. So the first item has index 0, the second has index 1, and so on. You can access individual items in the array using bracket notation and supplying the item's index, in the same way that you [accessed the letters in a string](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Useful_string_methods#retrieving_a_specific_string_character).

1. Enter the following into your console:

   ```js
   const shopping = ["bread", "milk", "cheese", "hummus", "noodles"];
   console.log(shopping[0]);
   // returns "bread"
   ```

2. You can also modify an item in an array by giving a single array item a new value. Try this:

   ```js
   const shopping = ["bread", "milk", "cheese", "hummus", "noodles"];
   shopping[0] = "tahini";
   console.log(shopping);
   // shopping will now return [ "tahini", "milk", "cheese", "hummus", "noodles" ]
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > We've said it before, but just as a reminder — JavaScript starts indexing arrays at zero!

3. Note that an array inside an array is called a multidimensional array. You can access an item inside an array that is itself inside another array by chaining two sets of square brackets together. For example, to access one of the items inside the array that is the third item inside the `random` array (see previous section), we could do something like this:

   ```js
   const random = ["tree", 795, [0, 1, 2]];
   random[2][2];
   ```

4. Try making some more modifications to your array examples before moving on. Play around a bit, and see what works and what doesn't.

## Finding the index of items in an array

If you don't know the index of an item, you can use the {{jsxref("Array.prototype.indexOf()","indexOf()")}} method.
The `indexOf()` method takes an item as an argument and will either return the item's index or `-1` if the item is not in the array:

```js
const birds = ["Parrot", "Falcon", "Owl"];
console.log(birds.indexOf("Owl")); //  2
console.log(birds.indexOf("Rabbit")); // -1
```

## Adding items

To add one or more items to the end of an array we can use {{jsxref("Array.prototype.push()","push()")}}. Note that you need to include one or more items that you want to add to the end of your array.

```js
const cities = ["Manchester", "Liverpool"];
cities.push("Cardiff");
console.log(cities); // [ "Manchester", "Liverpool", "Cardiff" ]
cities.push("Bradford", "Brighton");
console.log(cities); // [ "Manchester", "Liverpool", "Cardiff", "Bradford", "Brighton" ]
```

The new length of the array is returned when the method call completes. If you wanted to store the new array length in a variable, you could do something like this:

```js
const cities = ["Manchester", "Liverpool"];
const newLength = cities.push("Bristol");
console.log(cities); // [ "Manchester", "Liverpool", "Bristol" ]
console.log(newLength); // 3
```

To add an item to the start of the array, use {{jsxref("Array.prototype.unshift()","unshift()")}}:

```js
const cities = ["Manchester", "Liverpool"];
cities.unshift("Edinburgh");
console.log(cities); // [ "Edinburgh", "Manchester", "Liverpool" ]
```

## Removing items

To remove the last item from the array, use {{jsxref("Array.prototype.pop()","pop()")}}.

```js
const cities = ["Manchester", "Liverpool"];
cities.pop();
console.log(cities); // [ "Manchester" ]
```

The `pop()` method returns the item that was removed. To save that item in a new variable, you could do this:

```js
const cities = ["Manchester", "Liverpool"];
const removedCity = cities.pop();
console.log(removedCity); // "Liverpool"
```

To remove the first item from an array, use {{jsxref("Array.prototype.shift()","shift()")}}:

```js
const cities = ["Manchester", "Liverpool"];
cities.shift();
console.log(cities); // [ "Liverpool" ]
```

If you know the index of an item, you can remove it from the array using {{jsxref("Array.prototype.splice()","splice()")}}:

```js
const cities = ["Manchester", "Liverpool", "Edinburgh", "Carlisle"];
const index = cities.indexOf("Liverpool");
if (index !== -1) {
  cities.splice(index, 1);
}
console.log(cities); // [ "Manchester", "Edinburgh", "Carlisle" ]
```

In this call to `splice()`, the first argument says where to start removing items, and the second argument says how many items should be removed. So you can remove more than one item:

```js
const cities = ["Manchester", "Liverpool", "Edinburgh", "Carlisle"];
const index = cities.indexOf("Liverpool");
if (index !== -1) {
  cities.splice(index, 2);
}
console.log(cities); // [ "Manchester", "Carlisle" ]
```

## Accessing every item

Very often you will want to access every item in the array. You can do this using the {{jsxref("statements/for...of","for...of")}} statement:

```js
const birds = ["Parrot", "Falcon", "Owl"];

for (const bird of birds) {
  console.log(bird);
}
```

Sometimes you will want to do the same thing to each item in an array, leaving you with an array containing the changed items. You can do this using {{jsxref("Array.prototype.map()","map()")}}. The code below takes an array of numbers and doubles each number:

```js
function double(number) {
  return number * 2;
}
const numbers = [5, 2, 7, 6];
const doubled = numbers.map(double);
console.log(doubled); // [ 10, 4, 14, 12 ]
```

We give a function to the `map()`, and `map()` calls the function once for each item in the array, passing in the item. It then adds the return value from each function call to a new array, and finally returns the new array.

Sometimes you'll want to create a new array containing only the items in the original array that match some test. You can do that using {{jsxref("Array.prototype.filter()","filter()")}}. The code below takes an array of strings and returns an array containing just the strings that are greater than 8 characters long:

```js
function isLong(city) {
  return city.length > 8;
}
const cities = ["London", "Liverpool", "Totnes", "Edinburgh"];
const longer = cities.filter(isLong);
console.log(longer); // [ "Liverpool", "Edinburgh" ]
```

Like `map()`, we give a function to the `filter()` method, and `filter()` calls this function for every item in the array, passing in the item. If the function returns `true`, then the item is added to a new array. Finally it returns the new array.

## Converting between strings and arrays

Often you'll be presented with some raw data contained in a big long string, and you might want to separate the useful items out into a more useful form and then do things to them, like display them in a data table. To do this, we can use the {{jsxref("String.prototype.split()","split()")}} method. In its simplest form, this takes a single parameter, the character you want to separate the string at, and returns the substrings between the separator as items in an array.

> [!NOTE]
> Okay, this is technically a string method, not an array method, but we've put it in with arrays as it goes well here.

1. Let's play with this, to see how it works. First, create a string in your console:

   ```js
   const data = "Manchester,London,Liverpool,Birmingham,Leeds,Carlisle";
   ```

2. Now let's split it at each comma:

   ```js
   const cities = data.split(",");
   cities;
   ```

3. Finally, try finding the length of your new array, and retrieving some items from it:

   ```js
   cities.length;
   cities[0]; // the first item in the array
   cities[1]; // the second item in the array
   cities[cities.length - 1]; // the last item in the array
   ```

4. You can also go the opposite way using the {{jsxref("Array.prototype.join()","join()")}} method. Try the following:

   ```js
   const commaSeparated = cities.join(",");
   commaSeparated;
   ```

5. Another way of converting an array to a string is to use the {{jsxref("Array.prototype.toString()","toString()")}} method. `toString()` is arguably simpler than `join()` as it doesn't take a parameter, but more limiting. With `join()` you can specify different separators, whereas `toString()` always uses a comma. (Try running Step 4 with a different character than a comma.)

   ```js
   const dogNames = ["Rocket", "Flash", "Bella", "Slugger"];
   dogNames.toString(); // Rocket,Flash,Bella,Slugger
   ```

## Printing those products

It's your turn. In this exercise you'll return to the example we described earlier — printing out product names and prices on an invoice, then totaling the prices and printing them at the bottom. Follow the steps below to implement the logic to do so.

1. Click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.
2. Below the `// Part 1` comment are a number of strings, each one containing a product name and price separated by a colon. We'd like you to uncomment these and turn them into an array called `products`.
3. Below the `// Part 2` comment, start a `for...of()` loop to go through every item in the `products` array.
4. Below the `// Part 3` comment we want you to write a line of code that splits the current array item (`name:price`) into two separate items, one containing the name and one containing the price. If you are not sure how to do this, consult the [Useful string methods](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Useful_string_methods) article for some help, or even better, look at the [Converting between strings and arrays](#converting_between_strings_and_arrays) section of this article.
5. As part of the above line of code, you'll also want to convert the price from a string to a number. If you can't remember how to do this, check out the [first strings article](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Strings#numbers_vs._strings).
6. There is a variable called `total` that is created and given a value of `0` at the top of the code. Inside the loop (below `// Part 4`) we want you to add a line that adds the current item price to that total in each iteration of the loop, so that at the end of the code the correct total is printed onto the invoice. You might need an [assignment operator](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Math#assignment_operators) to do this.
7. We want you to change the next line after `// Part 5` so that the `itemText` variable is made equal to "current item name — $current item price", for example "Shoes — $23.99" in each case, so the correct information for each item is printed on the invoice. This is basic string concatenation, which should be familiar to you if you've followed the learning material so far.
8. Finally, below the `// Part 6` comment, you'll need to add a `}` to mark the end of the `for...of()` loop.

If you make a mistake, you can clear your work using the _Reset_ button in the MDN Playground. If you get really stuck, you can view the solution below the live output.

  list.appendChild(listItem);
}

totalBox.textContent = `Total: $${total.toFixed(2)}`;
```

## Storing the previous 5 searches

Let's get you to complete another exercise, to keep the practice flowing.

A good use for array methods like {{jsxref("Array.prototype.push()","push()")}} and {{jsxref("Array.prototype.pop()","pop()")}} is when you are maintaining a record of currently active items in a web app. In an animated scene for example, you might have an array of objects representing the background graphics currently displayed, and you might only want 50 displayed at once, for performance or clutter reasons. As new objects are created and added to the array, older ones can be deleted from the array to maintain the desired number.

In this example we're going to show a much simpler use — here we're giving you a fake search site, with a search box. The idea is that when terms are entered in the search box, the top 5 previous search terms are displayed in the list. When the number of terms goes over 5, the last term starts being deleted each time a new term is added to the top, so the 5 previous terms are always displayed.

> [!NOTE]
> In a real search app, you'd probably be able to click the previous search terms to return to previous searches, and it would display actual search results! We are just keeping it simple for now.

To complete the example, we need you to:

1. Click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.
2. Add a line below the `// Part 1` comment that adds the current value entered into the search input to the start of the array. This can be retrieved using `searchInput.value`.
3. Add a line below the `// Part 2` comment that removes the value currently at the end of the array.

If you make a mistake, you can clear your work using the _Reset_ button in the MDN Playground. If you get really stuck, you can view the solution below the live output.

```html hidden live-sample___arrays-2
<div class="output">
  <label for="search-box">Enter a search term: </label>
  <input id="search-box" type="search" />
  <button>Search</button>

  <ul></ul>
</div>
```

```css hidden live-sample___arrays-2
.output {
  margin: 1rem;
}
```

```js live-sample___arrays-2
const list = document.querySelector(".output ul");
const searchInput = document.querySelector(".output input");
const searchBtn = document.querySelector(".output button");

list.textContent = "";

const myHistory = [];
const MAX_HISTORY = 5;

searchBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  // we will only allow a term to be entered if the search input isn't empty
  if (searchInput.value !== "") {
    // Part 1

    // empty the list so that we don't display duplicate entries
    // the display is regenerated every time a search term is entered.
    list.textContent = "";

    // loop through the array, and display all the search terms in the list
    for (const itemText of myHistory) {
      const listItem = document.createElement("li");
      listItem.textContent = itemText;
      list.appendChild(listItem);
    }

    // If the array length is 5 or more, remove the oldest search term
    if (myHistory.length >= MAX_HISTORY) {
      // Part 2
    }

    // empty the search input and focus it, ready for the next term to be entered
    searchInput.value = "";
    searchInput.focus();
  }
});

## Summary

After reading through this article, we are sure you will agree that arrays seem pretty darn useful; you'll see them crop up everywhere in JavaScript, often in association with loops in order to do the same thing to every item in an array. We'll be teaching you all about loops later on in the module.

In the next article, we'll give you some tests that you can use to check how well you've understood and retained the information we've provided on arrays.

With most of the essential theory dealt with in the previous article, this article provides practical experience. Here you will get some practice building your own, custom function. Along the way, we'll also explain some useful details of dealing with functions.

## Let's build a function

The custom function we are going to build will be called `displayMessage()`. It will display a custom message box on a web page and will act as a customized replacement for a browser's built-in [`alert()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert) function. We've seen this before, but let's just refresh our memories. Type the following in your browser's JavaScript console, on any page you like:

```js
alert("This is a message");
```

The `alert()` function takes a single argument — the string that is displayed in the alert box. Try varying the string to change the message.

The `alert()` function is limited: you can alter the message, but you can't easily vary anything else, such as the color, icon, or anything else. We'll build one that will prove to be more fun.

> [!NOTE]
> This example should work in all modern browsers fine, but the styling might look a bit funny in slightly older browsers. We'd recommend you do this exercise in a modern browser like Firefox, Opera, or Chrome.

## The basic function

To begin with, let's put together a basic function.

> [!NOTE]
> For function naming conventions, you should follow the same rules as [variable naming conventions](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Variables#an_aside_on_variable_naming_rules). This is fine, as you can tell them apart — function names appear with parentheses after them, and variables don't.

1. Start by accessing the [function-start.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/building-blocks/functions/function-start.html) file and making a local copy. You'll see that the HTML is simple — the body contains just a single button. We've also provided some basic CSS to style the custom message box, and an empty {{htmlelement("script")}} element to put our JavaScript in.
2. Next, add the following inside the `<script>` element:

   ```js
   function displayMessage() {
     // …
   }
   ```

   We start off with the keyword `function`, which means we are defining a function. This is followed by the name we want to give to our function, a set of parentheses, and a set of curly braces. Any parameters we want to give to our function go inside the parentheses, and the code that runs when we call the function goes inside the curly braces.

3. Finally, add the following code inside the curly braces:

   ```js
   const body = document.body;

   const panel = document.createElement("div");
   panel.setAttribute("class", "msgBox");
   body.appendChild(panel);

   const msg = document.createElement("p");
   msg.textContent = "This is a message box";
   panel.appendChild(msg);

   const closeBtn = document.createElement("button");
   closeBtn.textContent = "x";
   panel.appendChild(closeBtn);

   closeBtn.addEventListener("click", () =>
     panel.parentNode.removeChild(panel),
   );
   ```

This is quite a lot of code to go through, so we'll walk you through it bit by bit.

The first line selects the {{htmlelement("body")}} element by using the [DOM API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) to get the [`body`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/body) property of the global [`document`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/body) object, and assigning that to a constant called `body`, so we can do things to it later on:

```js
const body = document.body;
```

The next section uses a DOM API function called {{domxref("document.createElement()")}} to create a {{htmlelement("div")}} element and store a reference to it in a constant called `panel`. This element will be the outer container of our message box.

We then use yet another DOM API function called {{domxref("Element.setAttribute()")}} to set a `class` attribute on our panel with a value of `msgBox`. This is to make it easier to style the element — if you look at the CSS on the page, you'll see that we are using a `.msgBox` class selector to style the message box and its contents.

Finally, we call a DOM function called {{domxref("Node.appendChild()")}} on the `body` constant we stored earlier, which nests one element inside the other as a child of it. We specify the panel `<div>` as the child we want to append inside the `<body>` element. We need to do this as the element we created won't just appear on the page on its own — we need to specify where to put it.

```js
const panel = document.createElement("div");
panel.setAttribute("class", "msgBox");
body.appendChild(panel);
```

The next two sections make use of the same `createElement()` and `appendChild()` functions we've already seen to create two new elements — a {{htmlelement("p")}} and a {{htmlelement("button")}} — and insert them in the page as children of the panel `<div>`. We use their {{domxref("Node.textContent")}} property — which represents the text content of an element — to insert a message inside the paragraph, and an "x" inside the button. This button will be what needs to be clicked/activated when the user wants to close the message box.

```js
const msg = document.createElement("p");
msg.textContent = "This is a message box";
panel.appendChild(msg);

const closeBtn = document.createElement("button");
closeBtn.textContent = "x";
panel.appendChild(closeBtn);
```

Finally, we call {{domxref("EventTarget/addEventListener", "addEventListener()")}} to add a function that will be called when the user clicks the "close" button. The code will delete the whole panel from the page — to close the message box.

Briefly, the `addEventListener()` method is provided by the button (or in fact, any element on the page) that can be passed a function and the name of an event. In this case, the name of the event is 'click', meaning that when the user clicks the button, the function will run. You'll learn a lot more about events in our [events article](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Events). The line inside the function uses the {{domxref("Node.removeChild()")}} DOM API function to specify that we want to remove a specific child element of the HTML element — in this case, the panel `<div>`.

```js
closeBtn.addEventListener("click", () => panel.parentNode.removeChild(panel));
```

Basically, this whole block of code is generating a block of HTML that looks like so, and inserting it into the page:

```html
<div class="msgBox">
  <p>This is a message box</p>
  <button>x</button>
</div>
```

That was a lot of code to work through — don't worry too much if you don't remember exactly how every bit of it works right now! The main part we want to focus on here is the function's structure and usage, but we wanted to show something interesting for this example.

## Calling the function

You've now got your function definition written into your `<script>` element just fine, but it will do nothing as it stands.

1. Try including the following line below your function to call it:

   ```js
   displayMessage();
   ```

   This line invokes the function, making it run immediately. When you save your code and reload it in the browser, you'll see the little message box appear immediately, only once. We are only calling it once, after all.

2. Now open your browser developer tools on the example page, go to the JavaScript console and type the line again there, you'll see it appear again! So this is fun — we now have a reusable function that we can call any time we like.

However, we probably want the message box to appear in response to user and system actions. In a real application, such a message box would probably be called in response to new data being available, or an error having occurred, or the user trying to delete their profile ("are you sure about this?"), or the user adding a new contact and the operation completing successfully, etc.

In this demo, we'll get the message box to appear when the user clicks the button.
Here's the steps you should follow to get this working:

1. Delete the previous line you added (`displayMessage();`).
2. Select the `<button>` element and store a reference to it in a constant. Add the following line to your code, above the function definition:

   ```js
   const btn = document.querySelector("button");
   ```

3. Create an event listener for button clicks that calls our function. Add the following line after the `const btn =` one:

   ```js
   btn.addEventListener("click", displayMessage);
   ```

   In a similar way to our closeBtn's click event handler, here we are calling some code in response to a button being clicked. But in this case, instead of calling an anonymous function containing some code, we are calling our `displayMessage()` function by name.

4. Finally, try saving and refreshing the page — now you should see the message box appear when you click the button.

You might be wondering why we haven't included the parentheses after the function name. This is because we don't want to call the function immediately — only after the button has been clicked. If you try changing the line to

```js example-bad
btn.addEventListener("click", displayMessage());
```

and saving and reloading, you'll see that the message box appears without the button being clicked! The parentheses in this context are sometimes called the "function invocation operator". You only use them when you want to run the function immediately in the current scope. In the same respect, the code inside the anonymous function is not run immediately, as it is inside the function scope.

If you tried the last experiment, make sure to undo the last change before carrying on.

## Improving the function with parameters

As it stands, the function is still not very useful — we don't want to just show the same default message every time. Let's improve our function by adding some parameters, allowing us to call it with some different options.

1. First of all, update the first line of the function:

   ```js
   function displayMessage() {
   ```

   to this:

   ```js
   function displayMessage(msgText, msgType) {
   ```

   Now when we call the function, we can provide two variable values inside the parentheses to specify the message to display in the message box, and the type of message it is.

2. To make use of the first parameter, update the following line inside your function:

   ```js
   msg.textContent = "This is a message box";
   ```

   to

   ```js
   msg.textContent = msgText;
   ```

3. Last but not least, you now need to update your function call to include some updated message text. Change the following line:

   ```js
   btn.addEventListener("click", displayMessage);
   ```

   to this block:

   ```js
   btn.addEventListener("click", () =>
     displayMessage("Woo, this is a different message!"),
   );
   ```

   If we want to specify parameters inside parentheses for the function we are calling, then we can't call it directly — we need to put it inside an anonymous function so that it isn't in the immediate scope and therefore isn't called immediately. Now it will not be called until the button is clicked.

4. Reload and try the code again and you'll see that it still works just fine, except that now you can also vary the message inside the parameter to get different messages displayed in the box!

### A more complex parameter

On to the next parameter. This one is going to involve slightly more work — we are going to set it so that depending on what the `msgType` parameter is set to, the function will display a different icon and a different background color.

1. First of all, download the icons needed for this exercise ([warning](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/building-blocks/functions/icons/warning.png) and [chat](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/building-blocks/functions/icons/chat.png)) from GitHub. Save them in a new folder called `icons` in the same location as your HTML file.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The warning and chat icons were originally found on [iconfinder.com](https://www.iconfinder.com/), and designed by [Nazarrudin Ansyari](https://www.iconfinder.com/nazarr) — Thanks! (The actual icon pages were since moved or removed.)

2. Next, find the CSS inside your HTML file. We'll make a few changes to make way for the icons. First, update the `.msgBox` width from:

   ```css
   width: 200px;
   ```

   to

   ```css
   width: 242px;
   ```

3. Next, add the following lines inside the `.msgBox p { }` rule:

   ```css
   padding-left: 82px;
   background-position: 25px center;
   background-repeat: no-repeat;
   ```

4. Now we need to add code to our `displayMessage()` function to handle displaying the icons. Add the following block just above the closing curly brace (`}`) of your function:

   ```js
   if (msgType === "warning") {
     msg.style.backgroundImage = 'url("icons/warning.png")';
     panel.style.backgroundColor = "red";
   } else if (msgType === "chat") {
     msg.style.backgroundImage = 'url("icons/chat.png")';
     panel.style.backgroundColor = "aqua";
   } else {
     msg.style.paddingLeft = "20px";
   }
   ```

   Here, if the `msgType` parameter is set as `"warning"`, the warning icon is displayed and the panel's background color is set to red. If it is set to `"chat"`, the chat icon is displayed and the panel's background color is set to aqua blue. If the `msgType` parameter is not set at all (or to something different), then the `else { }` part of the code comes into play, and the paragraph is given default padding and no icon, with no background panel color set either. This provides a default state if no `msgType` parameter is provided, meaning that it is an optional parameter!

5. Let's test out our updated function, try updating the `displayMessage()` call from this:

   ```js
   displayMessage("Woo, this is a different message!");
   ```

   to one of these:

   ```js
   displayMessage("Your inbox is almost full — delete some mails", "warning");
   displayMessage("Brian: Hi there, how are you today?", "chat");
   ```

   You can see how useful our (now not so) little function is becoming.

## Summary

Congratulations on reaching the end! This article took you through the entire process of building up a practical custom function, which with a bit more work could be transplanted into a real project. In the next article, we'll wrap up functions by explaining another essential related concept — return values.

# Making decisions in your code — conditionals

{{PreviousMenuNext("Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Silly_story_generator", "Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Test_your_skills/Conditionals", "Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting")}}

In any programming language, the code needs to make decisions and carry out actions accordingly depending on different inputs. For example, in a game, if the player's number of lives is 0, then it's game over. In a weather app, if it is being looked at in the morning, show a sunrise graphic; show stars and a moon if it is nighttime. In this article, we'll explore how so-called conditional statements work in JavaScript.

Human beings (and other animals) make decisions all the time that affect their lives, from small ("should I eat one cookie or two?") to large ("should I stay in my home country and work on my family's farm, or should I move to America and study astrophysics?")

Conditional statements allow us to represent such decision making in JavaScript, from the choice that must be made (for example, "one cookie or two"), to the resulting outcome of those choices (perhaps the outcome of "ate one cookie" might be "still felt hungry", and the outcome of "ate two cookies" might be "felt full, but mom scolded me for eating all the cookies".)

![A cartoon character resembling a person holding a cookie jar labeled 'Cookies'. There is a question mark above the head of the character. There are two speech bubbles. The left speech bubble has one cookie. The right speech bubble has two cookies. Together it implies the character is trying to decide if it wants to one cookie or two cookies.](cookie-choice-small.png)

## if...else statements

Let's look at by far the most common type of conditional statement you'll use in JavaScript — the humble [`if...else` statement](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else).

### Basic if...else syntax

Basic `if...else` syntax looks like this:

```js
if (condition) {
  /* code to run if condition is true */
} else {
  /* run some other code instead */
}
```

Here we've got:

1. The keyword `if` followed by some parentheses.
2. A condition to test, placed inside the parentheses (typically "is this value bigger than this other value?", or "does this value exist?"). The condition makes use of the [comparison operators](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Math#comparison_operators) we discussed earlier in the module and returns `true` or `false`.
3. A set of curly braces, inside which we have some code — this can be any code we like, and it only runs if the condition returns `true`.
4. The keyword `else`.
5. Another set of curly braces, inside which we have some more code — this can be any code we like, and it only runs if the condition is not `true` — or in other words, the condition is `false`.

This code is pretty human-readable — it is saying "**if** the **condition** returns `true`, run code A, **else** run code B"

You should note that you don't have to include the `else` and the second curly brace block — the following is also perfectly legal code:

```js
if (condition) {
  /* code to run if condition is true */
}

/* run some other code */
```

However, you need to be careful here — in this case, the second block of code is not controlled by the conditional statement, so it **always** runs, regardless of whether the condition returns `true` or `false`. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it might not be what you want — often you want to run one block of code _or_ the other, not both.

As a final point, while not recommended, you may sometimes see `if...else` statements written without the curly braces:

```js example-bad
if (condition) doSomething();
else doSomethingElse();
```

This syntax is perfectly valid, but it is much easier to understand the code if you use the curly braces to delimit the blocks of code, and use multiple lines and indentation.

### A real example

To understand this syntax better, let's consider a real example. Imagine a child being asked for help with a chore by their mother or father. The parent might say "Hey sweetheart! If you help me by going and doing the shopping, I'll give you some extra allowance so you can afford that toy you wanted." In JavaScript, we could represent this like so:

```js
let shoppingDone = false;
let childAllowance;

if (shoppingDone === true) {
  childAllowance = 10;
} else {
  childAllowance = 5;
}
```

This code as shown always results in the `shoppingDone` variable returning `false`, meaning disappointment for our poor child. It'd be up to us to provide a mechanism for the parent to set the `shoppingDone` variable to `true` if the child did the shopping.

### else if

The last example provided us with two choices, or outcomes — but what if we want more than two?

There is a way to chain on extra choices/outcomes to your `if...else` — using `else if`. Each extra choice requires an additional block to put in between `if () { }` and `else { }` — check out the following more involved example, which could be part of a simple weather forecast application:

```html
<label for="weather">Select the weather type today: </label>
<select id="weather">
  <option value="">--Make a choice--</option>
  <option value="sunny">Sunny</option>
  <option value="rainy">Rainy</option>
  <option value="snowing">Snowing</option>
  <option value="overcast">Overcast</option>
</select>

<p></p>
```

```js
const select = document.querySelector("select");
const para = document.querySelector("p");

select.addEventListener("change", setWeather);

function setWeather() {
  const choice = select.value;

  if (choice === "sunny") {
    para.textContent =
      "It is nice and sunny outside today. Wear shorts! Go to the beach, or the park, and get an ice cream.";
  } else if (choice === "rainy") {
    para.textContent =
      "Rain is falling outside; take a rain coat and an umbrella, and don't stay out for too long.";
  } else if (choice === "snowing") {
    para.textContent =
      "The snow is coming down — it is freezing! Best to stay in with a cup of hot chocolate, or go build a snowman.";
  } else if (choice === "overcast") {
    para.textContent =
      "It isn't raining, but the sky is grey and gloomy; it could turn any minute, so take a rain coat just in case.";
  } else {
    para.textContent = "";
  }
}
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('else_if', '100%', 100, "", "") }}

1. Here we've got an HTML {{htmlelement("select")}} element allowing us to make different weather choices, and a simple paragraph.
2. In the JavaScript, we are storing a reference to both the {{htmlelement("select")}} and {{htmlelement("p")}} elements, and adding an event listener to the `<select>` element so that when its value is changed, the `setWeather()` function is run.
3. When this function is run, we first set a variable called `choice` to the current value selected in the `<select>` element. We then use a conditional statement to show different text inside the paragraph depending on what the value of `choice` is. Notice how all the conditions are tested in `else if () { }` blocks, except for the first one, which is tested in an `if () { }` block.
4. The very last choice, inside the `else { }` block, is basically a "last resort" option — the code inside it will be run if none of the conditions are `true`. In this case, it serves to empty the text out of the paragraph if nothing is selected, for example, if a user decides to re-select the "--Make a choice--" placeholder option shown at the beginning.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also [find this example on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/building-blocks/simple-else-if.html) ([see it running live](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/building-blocks/simple-else-if.html) on there also.)

### A note on comparison operators

Comparison operators are used to test the conditions inside our conditional statements. We first looked at comparison operators back in our [Basic math in JavaScript — numbers and operators](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Math#comparison_operators) article. Our choices are:

- `===` and `!==` — test if one value is identical to, or not identical to, another.
- `<` and `>` — test if one value is less than or greater than another.
- `<=` and `>=` — test if one value is less than or equal to, or greater than or equal to, another.

We wanted to make a special mention of testing boolean (`true`/`false`) values, and a common pattern you'll come across again and again. Any value that is not `false`, `undefined`, `null`, `0`, `NaN`, or an empty string (`''`) actually returns `true` when tested as a conditional statement, therefore you can use a variable name on its own to test whether it is `true`, or even that it exists (that is, it is not undefined.) So for example:

```js
let cheese = "Cheddar";

if (cheese) {
  console.log("Yay! Cheese available for making cheese on toast.");
} else {
  console.log("No cheese on toast for you today.");
}
```

And, returning to our previous example about the child doing a chore for their parent, you could write it like this:

```js
let shoppingDone = false;
let childAllowance;

// We don't need to explicitly specify 'shoppingDone === true'
if (shoppingDone) {
  childAllowance = 10;
} else {
  childAllowance = 5;
}
```

### Nesting if...else

It is perfectly OK to put one `if...else` statement inside another one — to nest them. For example, we could update our weather forecast application to show a further set of choices depending on what the temperature is:

```js
if (choice === "sunny") {
  if (temperature < 86) {
    para.textContent = `It is ${temperature} degrees outside — nice and sunny. Let's go out to the beach, or the park, and get an ice cream.`;
  } else if (temperature >= 86) {
    para.textContent = `It is ${temperature} degrees outside — REALLY HOT! If you want to go outside, make sure to put some sunscreen on.`;
  }
}
```

Even though the code all works together, each `if...else` statement works completely independently of the other one.

### Logical operators: AND, OR and NOT

If you want to test multiple conditions without writing nested `if...else` statements, [logical operators](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators) can help you. When used in conditions, the first two do the following:

- `&&` — AND; allows you to chain together two or more expressions so that all of them have to individually evaluate to `true` for the whole expression to return `true`.
- `||` — OR; allows you to chain together two or more expressions so that one or more of them have to individually evaluate to `true` for the whole expression to return `true`.

To give you an AND example, the previous example snippet can be rewritten to this:

```js
if (choice === "sunny" && temperature < 86) {
  para.textContent = `It is ${temperature} degrees outside — nice and sunny. Let's go out to the beach, or the park, and get an ice cream.`;
} else if (choice === "sunny" && temperature >= 86) {
  para.textContent = `It is ${temperature} degrees outside — REALLY HOT! If you want to go outside, make sure to put some sunscreen on.`;
}
```

So for example, the first code block will only be run if `choice === 'sunny'` _and_ `temperature < 86` return `true`.

Let's look at a quick OR example:

```js
if (iceCreamVanOutside || houseStatus === "on fire") {
  console.log("You should leave the house quickly.");
} else {
  console.log("Probably should just stay in then.");
}
```

The last type of logical operator, NOT, expressed by the `!` operator, can be used to negate an expression. Let's combine it with OR in the above example:

```js
if (!(iceCreamVanOutside || houseStatus === "on fire")) {
  console.log("Probably should just stay in then.");
} else {
  console.log("You should leave the house quickly.");
}
```

In this snippet, if the OR statement returns `true`, the NOT operator will negate it so that the overall expression returns `false`.

You can combine as many logical statements together as you want, in whatever structure. The following example executes the code inside only if both OR statements return true, meaning that the overall AND statement will return true:

```js
if ((x === 5 || y > 3 || z <= 10) && (loggedIn || userName === "Steve")) {
  // run the code
}
```

A common mistake when using the logical OR operator in conditional statements is to try to state the variable whose value you are checking once, and then give a list of values it could be to return true, separated by `||` (OR) operators. For example:

```js example-bad
if (x === 5 || 7 || 10 || 20) {
  // run my code
}
```

In this case, the condition inside `if ()` will always evaluate to true since 7 (or any other non-zero value) always evaluates to `true`. This condition is actually saying "if x equals 5, or 7 is true — which it always is". This is logically not what we want! To make this work you've got to specify a complete test on either side of each OR operator:

```js
if (x === 5 || x === 7 || x === 10 || x === 20) {
  // run my code
}
```

## switch statements

`if...else` statements do the job of enabling conditional code well, but they are not without their downsides. They are mainly good for cases where you've got a couple of choices, and each one requires a reasonable amount of code to be run, and/or the conditions are complex (for example, multiple logical operators). For cases where you just want to set a variable to a certain choice of value or print out a particular statement depending on a condition, the syntax can be a bit cumbersome, especially if you've got a large number of choices.

In such a case, [`switch` statements](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch) are your friend — they take a single expression/value as an input, and then look through several choices until they find one that matches that value, executing the corresponding code that goes along with it. Here's some more pseudocode, to give you an idea:

```js
switch (expression) {
  case choice1:
    // run this code
    break;

  case choice2:
    // run this code instead
    break;

  // include as many cases as you like

  default:
    // actually, just run this code
    break;
}
```

Here we've got:

1. The keyword `switch`, followed by a set of parentheses.
2. An expression or value inside the parentheses.
3. The keyword `case`, followed by a choice that the expression/value could be, followed by a colon.
4. Some code to run if the choice matches the expression.
5. A `break` statement, followed by a semicolon. If the previous choice matches the expression/value, the browser stops executing the code block here, and moves on to any code that appears below the switch statement.
6. As many other cases (bullets 3–5) as you like.
7. The keyword `default`, followed by exactly the same code pattern as one of the cases (bullets 3–5), except that `default` does not have a choice after it, and you don't need the `break` statement as there is nothing to run after this in the block anyway. This is the default option that runs if none of the choices match.

> [!NOTE]
> You don't have to include the `default` section — you can safely omit it if there is no chance that the expression could end up equaling an unknown value. If there is a chance of this, however, you need to include it to handle unknown cases.

### A switch example

Let's have a look at a real example — we'll rewrite our weather forecast application to use a switch statement instead:

```html
<label for="weather">Select the weather type today: </label>
<select id="weather">
  <option value="">--Make a choice--</option>
  <option value="sunny">Sunny</option>
  <option value="rainy">Rainy</option>
  <option value="snowing">Snowing</option>
  <option value="overcast">Overcast</option>
</select>

<p></p>
```

```js
const select = document.querySelector("select");
const para = document.querySelector("p");

select.addEventListener("change", setWeather);

function setWeather() {
  const choice = select.value;

  switch (choice) {
    case "sunny":
      para.textContent =
        "It is nice and sunny outside today. Wear shorts! Go to the beach, or the park, and get an ice cream.";
      break;
    case "rainy":
      para.textContent =
        "Rain is falling outside; take a rain coat and an umbrella, and don't stay out for too long.";
      break;
    case "snowing":
      para.textContent =
        "The snow is coming down — it is freezing! Best to stay in with a cup of hot chocolate, or go build a snowman.";
      break;
    case "overcast":
      para.textContent =
        "It isn't raining, but the sky is grey and gloomy; it could turn any minute, so take a rain coat just in case.";
      break;
    default:
      para.textContent = "";
  }
}
```

## Ternary operator

There is one final bit of syntax we want to introduce you to before we get you to play with some examples. The [ternary or conditional operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_operator) is a small bit of syntax that tests a condition and returns one value/expression if it is `true`, and another if it is `false` — this can be useful in some situations, and can take up a lot less code than an `if...else` block if you have two choices that are chosen between via a `true`/`false` condition. The pseudocode looks like this:

```js-nolint
condition ? run this code : run this code instead
```

So let's look at an example:

```js
const greeting = isBirthday
  ? "Happy birthday Mrs. Smith — we hope you have a great day!"
  : "Good morning Mrs. Smith.";
```

Here we have a variable called `isBirthday` — if this is `true`, we give our guest a happy birthday message; if not, we give her the standard daily greeting.

### Ternary operator example

The ternary operator is not just for setting variable values; you can also run functions, or lines of code — anything you like. The following live example shows a simple theme chooser where the styling for the site is applied using a ternary operator.

```html
<label for="theme">Select theme: </label>
<select id="theme">
  <option value="white">White</option>
  <option value="black">Black</option>
</select>

<h1>This is my website</h1>
```

```js
const select = document.querySelector("select");
const html = document.querySelector("html");
document.body.style.padding = "10px";

function update(bgColor, textColor) {
  html.style.backgroundColor = bgColor;
  html.style.color = textColor;
}

select.addEventListener("change", () =>
  select.value === "black"
    ? update("black", "white")
    : update("white", "black"),
);
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Ternary_operator_example', '100%', 300, "", "") }}

Here we've got a {{htmlelement('select')}} element to choose a theme (black or white), plus a simple {{htmlelement("Heading_Elements", "h1")}} to display a website title. We also have a function called `update()`, which takes two colors as parameters (inputs). The website's background color is set to the first provided color, and its text color is set to the second provided color.

Finally, we've also got an [onchange](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/change_event) event listener that serves to run a function containing a ternary operator. It starts with a test condition — `select.value === 'black'`. If this returns `true`, we run the `update()` function with parameters of black and white, meaning that we end up with a background color of black and a text color of white. If it returns `false`, we run the `update()` function with parameters of white and black, meaning that the site colors are inverted.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also [find this example on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/building-blocks/simple-ternary.html) (see it [running live](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/building-blocks/simple-ternary.html) on there also.)

## Implementing a basic calendar

In this example, you are going to help us finish a basic calendar application. In the code you've got:

- A {{htmlelement("select")}} element to allow the user to choose between different months.
- A `change` event handler to detect when the value selected in the `<select>` menu is changed.
- A function called `createCalendar()` that draws the calendar and displays the correct month in the {{htmlelement("Heading_Elements", "h1")}} element.

To complete the example:

1. Click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.
2. Write a conditional statement inside the `createCalendar()` function, just below the `// ADD CONDITIONAL HERE` comment. It should:
   1. Look at the selected month (stored in the `choice` variable. This will be the `<select>` element value after the value changes, so "January" for example).
   2. Assign the `days` variable to be equal to the number of days in the selected month. To do this you'll have to look up the number of days in each month of the year. You can ignore leap years for the purposes of this example.

Hints:

- You are advised to use logical OR to group multiple months together into a single condition; many of them share the same number of days.
- Think about which number of days is the most common, and use that as a default value.

## Adding more color choices

In this example, you are going to take the ternary operator example we saw earlier and convert the ternary operator into a switch statement to allow us to apply more choices to the website. Look at the {{htmlelement("select")}} — this time you'll see that it has not two theme options, but five.

To complete the example:

1. Click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.
2. Add a switch statement just underneath the `// ADD SWITCH STATEMENT` comment:
   1. It should accept the `choice` variable as its input expression.
   2. For each case, the choice should equal one of the possible `<option>` values that can be selected, that is, `white`, `black`, `purple`, `yellow`, or `psychedelic`. Note that the option values are lowercase, while the option _labels_, as displayed in the live output, are capitalized. You should use the lowercase values in your code.
   3. For each case, the `update()` function should be run, and be passed two color values, the first one for the background color, and the second one for the text color. Remember that color values are strings, so they need to be wrapped in quotes.

# JavaScript debugging and error handling

{{PreviousMenuNext("Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/House_data_UI","Learn_web_development/Core/Frameworks_libraries", "Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting")}}

In this lesson, we will return to the subject of debugging JavaScript (which we first looked at in [What went wrong?](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/What_went_wrong)). Here we will delve deeper into techniques for tracking down errors, but also look at how to code defensively and handle errors in your code, avoiding problems in the first place.

## Recap on types of JavaScript error

Earlier in the module, in [What went wrong?](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/What_went_wrong), we looked broadly at the kinds of error that can occur in JavaScript programs, and said that they can be roughly broken down into two types — syntax errors and logic errors. We also helped you to make sense of some common types of JavaScript error message, and showed you how to do some simple debugging using [`console.log()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/log_static) statements.

In this article, we will go a bit deeper into the tools you have available for tracking down errors, and also look at ways to prevent errors in the first place.

## Linting your code

You should make sure your code is valid first before trying to track down specific errors. Make use of the W3C's [Markup validation service](https://validator.w3.org/), [CSS validation service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), and a JavaScript linter such as [ESLint](https://eslint.org/play/) to make sure your code is valid. This will likely shake out a bunch of errors, allowing you to concentrate on the errors that remain.

### Code editor plugins

It is not very convenient to have to copy and paste your code over to a web page to check its validity over and over again. We'd recommend installing a linter plugin on your code editor, so that you can get errors reported to you are you write your code. Try searching for ESLint in your code editor's plugins or extensions list, and installing it.

## Common JavaScript problems

There are a number of common JavaScript problems that you will want to be mindful of, such as:

- Basic syntax and logic problems (again, check out [Troubleshooting JavaScript](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/What_went_wrong)).
- Making sure variables, etc. are defined in the correct scope, and you are not running into conflicts between items declared in different places (see [Function scope and conflicts](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Functions#function_scope_and_conflicts)).
- Confusion about [`this`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this), in terms of what scope it applies to, and therefore if its value is what you intended. You can read [What is "this"?](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Object_basics#what_is_this) for a light introduction; you should also study examples like [this one](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/7ed039d17e820c93cafaff541aa65d874dde8323/javascript/oojs/assessment/main.js#L143), which shows a typical pattern of saving a `this` scope to a separate variable, then using that variable in nested functions so you can be sure you are applying functionality to the correct `this` scope.
- Incorrectly using functions inside loops that iterate with a global variable (more generally "getting the scope wrong").

> [!CALLOUT]
> For example, in [bad-for-loop.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/tools-testing/cross-browser-testing/javascript/bad-for-loop.html) (see [source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/tools-testing/cross-browser-testing/javascript/bad-for-loop.html)), we loop through 10 iterations using a variable defined with `var`, each time creating a paragraph and adding an [onclick](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event) event handler to it. When clicked, we want each one to display an alert message containing its number (the value of `i` at the time it was created). Instead they all report `i` as 11 — because the `for` loop does all its iterating before nested functions are invoked.
>
> The easiest solution is to declare the iteration variable with `let` instead of `var`—the value of `i` associated with the function is then unique to each iteration. See [good-for-loop.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/tools-testing/cross-browser-testing/javascript/good-for-loop.html) (see the [source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/tools-testing/cross-browser-testing/javascript/good-for-loop.html) also) for a version that works.

- Making sure [asynchronous operations](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Async_JS) have completed before trying to use the values they return. This usually means understanding how to use _promises_: using [`await`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await) appropriately or running the code to handle the result of an asynchronous call in the promise's {{jsxref("Promise.then()", "then()")}} handler. See [How to use promises](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Async_JS/Promises) for an introduction to this topic.

> [!NOTE]
> [Buggy JavaScript Code: The 10 Most Common Mistakes JavaScript Developers Make](https://www.toptal.com/javascript/10-most-common-javascript-mistakes) has some nice discussions of these common mistakes and more.

## The Browser JavaScript console

Browser developer tools have many useful features for helping to debug JavaScript. For a start, the JavaScript console will report errors in your code.

Make a local copy of our [fetch-broken](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/tools-testing/cross-browser-testing/javascript/fetch-broken/) example (see the [source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/tree/main/tools-testing/cross-browser-testing/javascript/fetch-broken) also).

If you look at the console, you'll see an error message. The exact wording is browser-dependent, but it will be something like: "Uncaught TypeError: heroes is not iterable", and the referenced line number is 25. If we look at the source code, the relevant code section is this:

```js
function showHeroes(jsonObj) {
  const heroes = jsonObj["members"];

  for (const hero of heroes) {
    // …
  }
}
```

So the code falls over as soon as we try to use `jsonObj` (which as you might expect, is supposed to be a [JSON object](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/JSON)). This is supposed to be fetched from an external `.json` file using the following {{domxref("Window/fetch", "fetch()")}} call:

```js
const requestURL =
  "https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/json/superheroes.json";

const response = fetch(requestURL);
populateHeader(response);
showHeroes(response);
```

But this fails.

## The Console API

You may already know what is wrong with this code, but let's explore it some more to show how you could investigate this. We'll start with the [Console](/en-US/docs/Web/API/console) API, which allows JavaScript code to interact with the browser's JavaScript console. It has a number of features available; you've already encountered [`console.log()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/log_static), which prints a custom message to the console.

Try adding a `console.log()` call to log the return value of `fetch()`, like this:

```js
const requestURL =
  "https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/json/superheroes.json";

const response = fetch(requestURL);
console.log(`Response value: ${response}`);
populateHeader(response);
showHeroes(response);
```

Refresh the page in the browser. This time, before the error message, you'll see a new message logged to the console:

```plain
Response value: [object Promise]
```

The `console.log()` output shows that the return value of `fetch()` is not the JSON data, it's a {{jsxref("Promise")}}. The `fetch()` function is asynchronous: it returns a `Promise` that is fulfilled only when the actual response has been received from the network. Before we can use the response, we have to wait for the `Promise` to be fulfilled.

### `console.error()` and call stacks

As a brief digression, lets try using a different console method to report the error — {{domxref("console.error()")}}. In your code, replace

```js
console.log(`Response value: ${response}`);
```

with

```js
console.error(`Response value: ${response}`);
```

Save your code and refresh the browser and you'll now see the message reported as an error, with the same color and icon as the uncaught error below it. In addition, there will now be a expand/collapse arrow next to the message. If you press this, you'll see a single line telling you the line in the JavaScript file the error originated from. In fact, the uncaught error line _also_ has this, but it has two lines:

```plain
showHeroes http://localhost:7800/js-debug-test/index.js:25
<anonymous> http://localhost:7800/js-debug-test/index.js:10
```

This means that the error is coming from the `showHeroes()` function, line 25, as we noted earlier. If you look at your code, you'll see that the anonymous call on line 10 is the line that is calling `showHeroes()`. These lines are referred to as a **call stack**, and can be really useful when trying to track down the source of an error involving lots of different locations in your code.

The `console.error()` call isn't all that useful in this case, but it can be useful for generating a call stack if one is not already available.

### Fixing the error

Anyway, let's get back to trying to fix our error. We can access the response from the fulfilled `Promise` by chaining the {{jsxref("Promise.prototype.then()", "then()")}} method onto the end of the `fetch()` call. We can then pass the resulting response value into the functions that accept it, like this:

```js
fetch(requestURL).then((response) => {
  populateHeader(response);
  showHeroes(response);
});
```

Save and refresh, and see if your code is working. Spoiler alert — the above change has not fixed the problem. Unfortunately, we **still have the same error**!

> [!NOTE]
> To summarize, any time something is not working and a value does not appear to be what it is meant to be at some point in your code, you can use `console.log()`, `console.error()`, or another similar function to print out the value and see what is happening.

## Using the JavaScript debugger

Let's investigate this problem further using a more sophisticated feature of browser developer tools: the [JavaScript debugger](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/debugger/index.html) as it is called in Firefox.

> [!NOTE]
> Similar tools are available in other browsers; the [Sources tab](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/#sources) in Chrome, Debugger in Safari (see [Safari Web Development Tools](https://developer.apple.com/safari/tools/)), etc.

In Firefox, the Debugger tab looks like this:

![Firefox debugger](debugger-tab.png)

- On the left, you can select the script you want to debug (in this case we have only one).
- The center panel shows the code in the selected script.
- The right-hand panel shows useful details pertaining to the current environment — _Breakpoints_, _Callstack_ and currently active _Scopes_.

The main feature of such tools is the ability to add breakpoints to code — these are points where the execution of the code stops, and at that point you can examine the environment in its current state and see what is going on.

Let's explore using breakpoints:

1. The error is being thrown at the same line as before — `for (const hero of heroes) {` — line 26 in the screenshot below. Click on the line number in the center panel to add a breakpoint to it (you'll see a blue arrow appear over the top of it).
2. Now refresh the page (<kbd>Cmd</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>) — the browser will pause execution of the code on that line. At this point, the right-hand side will update to show the following:

![Firefox debugger with a breakpoint](breakpoint.png)

- Under _Breakpoints_, you'll see the details of the breakpoint you have set.
- Under _Call Stack_, you'll see a few entries — this is basically the same as the callstack we looked at earlier in the `console.error()` section. _Call Stack_ shows a list of the functions that were invoked to cause the current function to be invoked. At the top, we have `showHeroes()`, the function we are currently in, and second we have `onload`, which stores the event handler function containing the call to `showHeroes()`.
- Under _Scopes_, you'll see the currently active scope for the function we are looking at. We only have three — `showHeroes`, `block`, and `Window` (the global scope). Each scope can be expanded to show the values of variables inside the scope when execution of the code was stopped.

We can find out some very useful information in here:

1. Expand the `showHeroes` scope — you can see from this that the heroes variable is `undefined`, indicating that accessing the `members` property of `jsonObj` (first line of the function) didn't work.
2. You can also see that the `jsonObj` variable is storing a {{domxref("Response")}} object, not a JSON object.

The argument to `showHeroes()` is the value the `fetch()` promise was fulfilled with. So this promise is not in the JSON format: it is a `Response` object. There's an extra step needed to retrieve the content of the response as a JSON object.

We'd like you to try fixing this problem yourself. To get you started, see the documentation for the {{domxref("Response")}} object. If you get stuck, you can find the fixed source code at <https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/tree/main/tools-testing/cross-browser-testing/javascript/fetch-fixed>.

> [!NOTE]
> The debugger tab has many other useful features that we've not discussed here, for example conditional breakpoints and watch expressions. For a lot more information, see the [Debugger](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/debugger/index.html) page.

## Handling JavaScript errors in your code

HTML and CSS are permissive — errors and unrecognized features can often be handled due to the nature of the languages. For example, CSS will ignore unrecognized properties, and the rest of the code will often just work. JavaScript is not as permissive as HTML and CSS however — if the JavaScript engine encounters mistakes or unrecognized syntax, it will often throw errors.

Let's explore a common strategy for handling JavaScript errors in your code. The following sections are designed to be followed by making a copy of the below template file as `handling-errors.html` on your local machine, adding the code snippets in between the opening and closing `<script>` and `</script>` tags, then opening the file in a browser and looking at the output in the devtools JavaScript console.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>Handling JS errors</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script>
      // Code goes below this line
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Conditionals

A common use of [JavaScript conditionals](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Conditionals) is to handle errors. Conditionals allow you to run different code depending on the value of a variable. Often you will want to use this defensively, to avoid throwing an error if the value does not exist or is of the wrong type, or to capture an error if the value would cause an incorrect result to be returned, which could cause problems later on.

Let's look at an example. Say we have a function that takes as an argument equal to the user's height in inches and returns their height in meters, to 2 decimal places. This could look like so:

```js
function inchesToMeters(num) {
  const mVal = (num * 2.54) / 100;
  const m2dp = mVal.toFixed(2);
  return m2dp;
}
```

1. In your example file's `<script>` element, declare a `const` called `height` and assign it a value of `70`:

   ```js
   const height = 70;
   ```

2. Copy the above function below the previous line.

3. Call the function, passing it the `height` constant as its argument, and log the return value to the console:

   ```js
   console.log(inchesToMeters(height));
   ```

4. Load the example in a browser and look at the devtools JavaScript console. You should see a value of `1.78` logged to it.

5. So this works fine in isolation. But what happens if the provided data is missing or not correct? Try out these scenarios:
   - If you change the `height` value to `"70"` (that is, `70` expressed as a string), the example should ... still work fine. This is because the calculation on the first line of the string coerces the value into a number data type. This is OK in a simple case like this, but in more complex code the wrong data can lead to all kind of bugs, some of them subtle and hard to detect!
   - If you change `height` to a value that can't be coerced to a number, like `"70 inches"` or `["Bob", 70]`, or {{jsxref("NaN")}}, the example should return the result as `NaN`. This could cause all kind of problems, for example if you want to include the user's height somewhere in the website user interface.
   - If you remove the `height` value altogether (comment it out by adding `//` at the start of the line), the console will show an error along the lines of "Uncaught ReferenceError: height is not defined", the likes of which could bring your application grinding to a halt.

   Obviously, none of these outcomes are great. How do we defend against bad data?

6. Let's add a conditional inside our function to test whether the data is good before we try to do the calculation. Try replacing your current function with the following:

   ```js
   function inchesToMeters(num) {
     if (typeof num !== "number" || Number.isNaN(num)) {
       console.log("A number was not provided. Please correct the input.");
       return undefined;
     }
     const mVal = (num * 2.54) / 100;
     const m2dp = mVal.toFixed(2);
     return m2dp;
   }
   ```

7. Now if you try the first two scenarios again, you'll see our slightly more useful message returned, to give you an idea of what needs to be done to fix the problem. You could put anything in there that you like, including trying to run code to correct the value of `num`, but this is not advised — this function has one simple purpose, and you should handle correcting the value somewhere else in the system.

   > [!NOTE]
   > In the `if()` statement, we first test whether the data type of `num` is `"number"` using the [`typeof`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof) operator, but we also test whether {{jsxref("Number.isNaN", "Number.isNaN(num)")}} returns `false`. We have to do this to defend against the specific case of `num` being set to `NaN`, because `typeof NaN` still returns `"number"`!

8. However, if you try the third scenario again, you will still get the "Uncaught ReferenceError: height is not defined" error thrown at you. You can't fix the fact that a value is not available from inside a function that is trying to use the value.

How do we handle this? Well, it's probably better to get our function to return a custom error when it doesn't receive the correct data. We'll look at how to do that first, then we'll handle all the errors together.

### Throwing custom errors

You can throw a custom error at any point in your code using the [`throw`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw) statement, coupled with the {{jsxref("Error.Error", "Error()")}} constructor. Let's see this in action.

1. In your function, replace the `console.log()` line inside the `else` block of your function with the following line:

   ```js
   throw new Error("A number was not provided. Please correct the input.");
   ```

2. Run your example again, but make sure `num` is set to a bad (that is, non-number) value. This time, you should see your custom error thrown, along with a useful call stack to help you locate the source of the error (although note that the message still tells us that the error is "uncaught", or "unhandled"). OK, so errors are annoying, but this is way more useful than running the function successfully and returning a non-number value that could cause problems later on.

So, how do we handle all those errors then?

### try...catch

The [`try...catch`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch) statement is specially designed to handle errors. It has the following structure:

```js
try {
  // Run some code
} catch (error) {
  // Handle any errors
}
```

Inside the `try` block, you try running some code. If this code runs without an error being thrown, all is well, and the `catch` block is ignored. However, if an error is thrown the `catch` block is run, which provides access to the {{jsxref("Error")}} object representing the error, and allows you to run code to handle it.

Let's use `try...catch` in our code.

1. Replace the `console.log()` line that calls the `inchesToMeters()` function at the end of your script with the following block. We are now running our `console.log()` line inside a `try` block, and handling any errors that it returns inside a corresponding `catch` block.

   ```js
   try {
     console.log(inchesToMeters(height));
   } catch (error) {
     console.error(error);
     console.log("Insert code to handle the error");
   }
   ```

2. Save and refresh, and you should now see two things:
   - The error message and call stack as before, but this time, without a label of "uncaught", or "unhandled".
   - The logged message "Insert code to handle the error".

3. Now try updating `num` to a good (number) value, and you'll see the result of the calculation logged, with no error message.

This is significant — any thrown errors are no longer unhandled, so they won't bring the application crashing to a halt. You can run whatever code you like to handle the error. Above we are just logging a message, but for example you could call whatever function was run earlier to ask the user to enter their height, this time asking them to correct the input error. You could even use an `if...else` statement to run different error handling code depending on what type of error is returned.

### Feature detection

Feature detection is useful when you are planning to use new JavaScript features that might not be supported in all browsers. Test for the feature, and then conditionally run code to provide an acceptable experience both in browsers that do and don't support the feature. As a quick example, the [Geolocation API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) (which exposes available location data for the device the web browser is running on) has a main entry point for its use — a `geolocation` property available on the global [Navigator](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator) object. Therefore, you can detect whether the browser supports geolocation or not by using a similar `if()` structure to what we saw earlier:

```js
if ("geolocation" in navigator) {
  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((position) => {
    // show the location on a map, perhaps using the Google Maps API
  });
} else {
  // Give the user a choice of static maps instead
}
```

You can find some more feature detection examples in [Alternatives to UA sniffing](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Browser_detection_using_the_user_agent#alternatives_to_ua_sniffing).

## Finding help

There are many other issues you'll encounter with JavaScript (and HTML and CSS!), making knowledge of how to find answers online invaluable.

Among the best sources of support information are MDN (that's where you are now!), [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/), and [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/).

- To use the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN), most people do a search engine search of the technology they are trying to find information on, plus the term "mdn", for example, "mdn HTML video".
- [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/) provides support information, along with a few useful external resource links. For example, see <https://caniuse.com/#search=video> (you just have to enter the feature you are searching for into the text box).
- [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/) (SO) is a forum site where you can ask questions and have fellow developers share their solutions, look up previous posts, and help other developers. You are advised to look and see if there is an answer to your question already, before posting a new question. For example, we searched for "disabling autofocus on HTML dialog" on SO, and very quickly came up with [Disable showModal auto-focusing using HTML attributes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63267581/disable-showmodal-auto-focusing-using-html-attributes).

Aside from that, try searching your favorite search engine for an answer to your problem. It is often useful to search for specific error messages if you have them — other developers will be likely to have had the same problems as you.

## Summary

So that's JavaScript debugging and error handling. Simple huh? Maybe not so simple, but this article should at least give you a start, and some ideas on how to tackle the JavaScript-related problems you will come across.

That's it for the Dynamic scripting with JavaScript module; congratulations on reaching the end! In the next module we'll help you explore JavaScript frameworks and libraries.

{{PreviousMenuNext("Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Test_your_skills/Object_basics","Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Image_gallery", "Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting")}}

When writing web pages and apps, one of the most common things you'll want to do is change the document structure in some way. This is usually done by manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) via a set of built-in browser APIs for controlling HTML and styling information. In this article we'll introduce you to **DOM scripting**.

## The important parts of a web browser

Web browsers are very complicated pieces of software with a lot of moving parts, many of which can't be controlled or manipulated by a web developer using JavaScript. You might think that such limitations are a bad thing, but browsers are locked down for good reasons, mostly centering around security. Imagine if a website could get access to your stored passwords or other sensitive information, and log into websites as if it were you?

Despite the limitations, Web APIs still give us access to a lot of functionality that enable us to do a great many things with web pages. There are a few really obvious bits you'll reference regularly in your code — consider the following diagram, which represents the main parts of a browser directly involved in viewing web pages:

![Important parts of web browser; the document is the web page. The window includes the entire document and also the tab. The navigator is the browser, which includes the window (which includes the document) and all other windows.](document-window-navigator.png)

- The **window** represents the browser tab that a web page is loaded into; this is represented in JavaScript by the {{domxref("Window")}} object. Using methods available on this object you can do things like return the window's size (see {{domxref("Window.innerWidth")}} and {{domxref("Window.innerHeight")}}), manipulate the document loaded into that window, store data specific to that document on the client-side (for example using a local database or other storage mechanism), attach an [event handler](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Events) to the current window, and more.
- The **navigator** represents the state and identity of the browser as it exists on the web. In JavaScript, this is represented by the {{domxref("Navigator")}} object. You can use this object to retrieve things like the user's preferred language, a media stream from the user's webcam, etc.
- The **document** (represented by the DOM in browsers) is the actual page loaded into the window, and is represented in JavaScript by the {{domxref("Document")}} object. You can use this object to return and manipulate information on the HTML and CSS that comprises the document, for example get a reference to an element in the DOM, change its text content, apply new styles to it, create new elements and add them to the current element as children, or even delete it altogether.

In this article we'll focus mostly on manipulating the document, but we'll show a few other useful bits besides.

## The document object model

Let's provide a brief recap on the Document Object Model (DOM), which we also looked at earlier in the course. The document currently loaded in each one of your browser tabs is represented by a DOM. This is a "tree structure" representation created by the browser that enables the HTML structure to be easily accessed by programming languages — for example the browser itself uses it to apply styling and other information to the correct elements as it renders a page, and developers like you can manipulate the DOM with JavaScript after the page has been rendered.

> [!NOTE]
> Scrimba's [The Document Object Model](https://scrimba.com/learn-javascript-c0v/~0g?via=mdn) <sup>[_MDN learning partner_](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Learning_content#partner_links_and_embeds)</sup> provides a handy walkthrough of the "DOM" term and what it means.

We have created an example page at [dom-example.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/apis/document-manipulation/dom-example.html) ([see it live also](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/apis/document-manipulation/dom-example.html)). Try opening this up in your browser — it is a very simple page containing a {{htmlelement("section")}} element inside which you can find an image, and a paragraph with a link inside. The HTML source code looks like this:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Simple DOM example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <section>
      <img
        src="dinosaur.png"
        alt="A red Tyrannosaurus Rex: A two legged dinosaur
        standing upright like a human, with small arms, and a
        large head with lots of sharp teeth." />
      <p>
        Here we will add a link to the
        <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla homepage</a>
      </p>
    </section>
  </body>
</html>
```

The DOM on the other hand looks like this:

![Tree structure representation of Document Object Model: The top node is the doctype and HTML element. Child nodes of the HTML include head and body. Each child element is a branch. All text, even white space, is shown as well.](dom-screenshot.png)

> [!NOTE]
> This DOM tree diagram was created using Ian Hickson's [Live DOM viewer](https://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/).

Each entry in the tree is called a **node**. You can see in the diagram above that some nodes represent elements (identified as `HTML`, `HEAD`, `META` and so on) and others represent text (identified as `#text`). There are [other types of nodes as well](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/nodeType), but these are the main ones you'll encounter.

Nodes are also referred to by their position in the tree relative to other nodes:

- **Root node**: The top node in the tree, which in the case of HTML is always the `HTML` node (other markup vocabularies like SVG and custom XML will have different root elements).
- **Child node**: A node _directly_ inside another node. For example, `IMG` is a child of `SECTION` in the above example.
- **Descendant node**: A node _anywhere_ inside another node. For example, `IMG` is a child of `SECTION` in the above example, and it is also a descendant. `IMG` is not a child of `BODY`, as it is two levels below it in the tree, but it is a descendant of `BODY`.
- **Parent node**: A node which has another node inside it. For example, `BODY` is the parent node of `SECTION` in the above example.
- **Sibling nodes**: Nodes that sit on the same level under the same parent node in the DOM tree. For example, `IMG` and `P` are siblings in the above example.

It is useful to familiarize yourself with this terminology before working with the DOM, as a number of the code terms you'll come across make use of them. You'll also come across them in CSS (for example, descendant selector, child selector).

## Doing some basic DOM manipulation

To start learning about DOM manipulation, let's begin with a practical example.

1. Take a local copy of the [dom-example.html page](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/apis/document-manipulation/dom-example.html) and the [image](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/apis/document-manipulation/dinosaur.png) that goes along with it.
2. Add a `<script></script>` element just above the closing `</body>` tag.
3. To manipulate an element inside the DOM, you first need to select it and store a reference to it inside a variable. Inside your script element, add the following line:

   ```js
   const link = document.querySelector("a");
   ```

4. Now we have the element reference stored in a variable, we can start to manipulate it using properties and methods available to it (these are defined on interfaces like {{domxref("HTMLAnchorElement")}} in the case of {{htmlelement("a")}} element, its more general parent interface {{domxref("HTMLElement")}}, and {{domxref("Node")}} — which represents all nodes in a DOM). First of all, let's change the text inside the link by updating the value of the {{domxref("Node.textContent")}} property. Add the following line below the previous one:

   ```js
   link.textContent = "Mozilla Developer Network";
   ```

5. We should also change the URL the link is pointing to, so that it doesn't go to the wrong place when it is clicked on. Add the following line, again at the bottom:

   ```js
   link.href = "https://developer.mozilla.org";
   ```

Note that, as with many things in JavaScript, there are many ways to select an element and store a reference to it in a variable. {{domxref("Document.querySelector()")}} is the recommended modern approach. It is convenient because it allows you to select elements using CSS selectors. The above `querySelector()` call will match the first {{htmlelement("a")}} element that appears in the document. If you wanted to match and do things to multiple elements, you could use {{domxref("Document.querySelectorAll()")}}, which matches every element in the document that matches the selector, and stores references to them in an [array](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Arrays)-like object called a {{domxref("NodeList")}}.

There are older methods available for grabbing element references, such as:

- {{domxref("Document.getElementById()")}}, which selects an element with a given `id` attribute value, e.g., `<p id="myId">My paragraph</p>`. The ID is passed to the function as a parameter, i.e., `const elementRef = document.getElementById('myId')`.
- {{domxref("Document.getElementsByTagName()")}}, which returns an array-like object containing all the elements on the page of a given type, for example `<p>`s, `<a>`s, etc. The element type is passed to the function as a parameter, i.e., `const elementRefArray = document.getElementsByTagName('p')`.

These two work better in older browsers than the modern methods like `querySelector()`, but are not as convenient. Have a look and see what others you can find!

### Creating and placing new nodes

The above has given you a little taste of what you can do, but let's go further and look at how we can create new elements.

1. Going back to the current example, let's start by grabbing a reference to our {{htmlelement("section")}} element — add the following code at the bottom of your existing script (do the same with the other lines too):

   ```js
   const sect = document.querySelector("section");
   ```

2. Now let's create a new paragraph using {{domxref("Document.createElement()")}} and give it some text content in the same way as before:

   ```js
   const para = document.createElement("p");
   para.textContent = "We hope you enjoyed the ride.";
   ```

3. You can now append the new paragraph at the end of the section using {{domxref("Node.appendChild()")}}:

   ```js
   sect.appendChild(para);
   ```

4. Finally for this part, let's add a text node to the paragraph the link sits inside, to round off the sentence nicely. First we will create the text node using {{domxref("Document.createTextNode()")}}:

   ```js
   const text = document.createTextNode(
     " — the premier source for web development knowledge.",
   );
   ```

5. Now we'll grab a reference to the paragraph the link is inside, and append the text node to it:

   ```js
   const linkPara = document.querySelector("p");
   linkPara.appendChild(text);
   ```

That's most of what you need for adding nodes to the DOM — you'll make a lot of use of these methods when building dynamic interfaces (we'll look at some examples later).

### Moving and removing elements

There may be times when you want to move nodes, or delete them from the DOM altogether. This is perfectly possible.

If we wanted to move the paragraph with the link inside it to the bottom of the section, we could do this:

```js
sect.appendChild(linkPara);
```

This moves the paragraph down to the bottom of the section. You might have thought it would make a second copy of it, but this is not the case — `linkPara` is a reference to the one and only copy of that paragraph. If you wanted to make a copy and add that as well, you'd need to use {{domxref("Node.cloneNode()")}} instead.

Removing a node is pretty simple as well, at least when you have a reference to the node to be removed and its parent. In our current case, we just use {{domxref("Node.removeChild()")}}, like this:

```js
sect.removeChild(linkPara);
```

When you want to remove a node based only on a reference to itself, which is fairly common, you can use {{domxref("Element.remove()")}}:

```js
linkPara.remove();
```

This method is not supported in older browsers. They have no method to tell a node to remove itself, so you'd have to do the following:

```js
linkPara.parentNode.removeChild(linkPara);
```

Have a go at adding the above lines to your code.

### Manipulating styles

It is possible to manipulate CSS styles via JavaScript in a variety of ways.

To start with, you can get a list of all the stylesheets attached to a document using {{domxref("Document.styleSheets")}}, which returns an array-like object with {{domxref("CSSStyleSheet")}} objects. You can then add/remove styles as wished. However, we're not going to expand on those features because they are a somewhat archaic and difficult way to manipulate style. There are much easier ways.

The first way is to add inline styles directly onto elements you want to dynamically style. This is done with the {{domxref("HTMLElement.style")}} property, which contains inline styling information for each element in the document. You can set properties of this object to directly update element styles.

1. As an example, try adding these lines to our ongoing example:

   ```js
   para.style.color = "white";
   para.style.backgroundColor = "black";
   para.style.padding = "10px";
   para.style.width = "250px";
   para.style.textAlign = "center";
   ```

2. Reload the page and you'll see that the styles have been applied to the paragraph. If you look at that paragraph in your browser's [Page Inspector/DOM inspector](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/page_inspector/index.html), you'll see that these lines are indeed adding inline styles to the document:

   ```html
   <p
     style="color: white; background-color: black; padding: 10px; width: 250px; text-align: center;">
     We hope you enjoyed the ride.
   </p>
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> Notice how the JavaScript property versions of the CSS styles are written in {{Glossary("camel_case", "lower camel case")}} whereas the CSS versions are hyphenated ({{Glossary("kebab_case", "kebab-case")}}) (e.g., `backgroundColor` versus `background-color`). Make sure you don't get these mixed up, otherwise it won't work.

There is another common way to dynamically manipulate styles on your document, which is to write the styles in a separate stylesheet, and reference those styles by adding/removing a class name.

1. Delete the previous five lines you added to the JavaScript.
2. Add the following inside your HTML {{htmlelement("head")}}:

   ```html
   <style>
     .highlight {
       color: white;
       background-color: black;
       padding: 10px;
       width: 250px;
       text-align: center;
     }
   </style>
   ```

3. To add this class name to your element, use the element's {{domxref("Element/classList", "classList")}}'s `add()` method:

   ```js
   para.classList.add("highlight");
   ```

4. Refresh your page, and you'll see no change — the CSS is still applied to the paragraph, but this time by giving it a class that is selected by our CSS rule, not as inline CSS styles.

Which method you choose is up to you; both have their advantages and disadvantages. The first method takes less setup and is good for simple uses, whereas the second method is more purist (no mixing CSS and JavaScript, no inline styles, which are seen as a bad practice). As you start building larger and more involved apps, you will probably start using the second method more, but it is really up to you.

At this point, we haven't really done anything useful! There is no point using JavaScript to create static content — you might as well just write it into your HTML and not use JavaScript. It is more complex than HTML, and creating your content with JavaScript also has other issues attached to it (such as not being readable by search engines).

In the next section we will look at a more practical use of DOM APIs.

> [!NOTE]
> You can find our [finished version of the dom-example.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/apis/document-manipulation/dom-example-manipulated.html) demo on GitHub ([see it live also](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/apis/document-manipulation/dom-example-manipulated.html)).

## Creating a dynamic shopping list

In this exercise, we want you to build a dynamic shopping list that allows you to add items using a form input and a button. After you type an item in the input field and click the button or press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key, the following should happen:

- The item should appear in the list.
- Each item should be given a button that can be pressed to delete that item off the list.
- Each item should have a button next to it that removes the item from the list when clicked.
- The input fields should be cleared and focused, ready for the next item entry.

The finished demo will look something like the following — try it out before you build it!

```html hidden live-sample___dynamic-shopping-list
<h1>My shopping list</h1>

<form>
  <label for="item">Enter a new item:</label>
  <input type="text" name="item" id="item" />
  <button>Add item</button>
</form>

<ul></ul>
```

```css hidden live-sample___dynamic-shopping-list
li {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

li button {
  font-size: 12px;
  margin-left: 20px;
}
```

```js hidden live-sample___dynamic-shopping-list
const list = document.querySelector("ul");
const input = document.querySelector("input");
const button = document.querySelector("button");

button.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();

  const myItem = input.value;
  input.value = "";

  const listItem = document.createElement("li");
  const listText = document.createElement("span");
  const listBtn = document.createElement("button");

  listItem.appendChild(listText);
  listText.textContent = myItem;
  listItem.appendChild(listBtn);
  listBtn.textContent = "Delete";
  list.appendChild(listItem);

  listBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
    list.removeChild(listItem);
  });

  input.focus();
});
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("dynamic-shopping-list", "100%", 300)}}

To complete the exercise, follow the steps below, and make sure that the list behaves as described above.

1. To begin, download a copy of our [shopping-list.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/apis/document-manipulation/shopping-list.html) starting file and make a copy of it somewhere. You'll see that it has some minimal CSS, a form with a label, input, and button, an empty list, and a {{htmlelement("script")}} element. You'll be making all your additions inside the script.
2. Create three variables that hold references to the list ({{htmlelement("ul")}}), {{htmlelement("input")}}, and {{htmlelement("button")}} elements.
3. Create a [function](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Functions) that will run in response to the button being clicked.
4. Inside the function body, start by calling [`preventDefault()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault). Since the input is wrapped in a form element, pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key will trigger the form to submit. The call to `preventDefault()` will prevent the form from refreshing the page so a new item can be added to the list instead.
5. Continue by storing the current [value](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/value) of the input in a variable.
6. Next, clear the input element by setting its value to an empty string (`""`).
7. Create three new elements — a list item ({{htmlelement('li')}}), a {{htmlelement('span')}}, and a {{htmlelement('button')}} — and store them in variables.
8. Append the span and button as children of the list item.
9. Set the text content of the span to the input value you saved earlier, and set the text content of the button to `Delete`.
10. Append the list item to the list.
11. Attach an event handler to the **Delete** button so that, when clicked, it removes the entire list item (`<li>...</li>`).
12. Finally, use the [`focus()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/focus) method to focus the input element, so it's ready for entering the next shopping list item.

## Summary

We have reached the end of our study of document and DOM manipulation. At this point you should understand what the important parts of a web browser are with respect to controlling documents and other aspects of the user's web experience. Most importantly, you should understand what the Document Object Model is, and how to manipulate it to create useful functionality.

# Event bubbling

{{PreviousMenuNext("Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Events","Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Test_your_skills/Events", "Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting")}}

We've seen that a web page is composed of _elements_ — headings, paragraphs of text, images, buttons, and so on — and that you can listen for events that happen to these elements. For example, you could add a listener to a button, and it will run when the user clicks the button.

We've also seen that these elements can be _nested_ inside each other: for example, a {{htmlelement("button")}} could be placed inside a {{htmlelement("div")}} element. In this case we'd call the `<div>` element a _parent_ element, and the `<button>` a _child_ element.

In this chapter we'll look at **event bubbling** — this is what happens when you add an event listener to a parent element, and the user clicks the child element.

## Introducing event bubbling

Let's introduce and define event bubbling by way of an example.

### Setting a listener on a parent element

Consider a web page like this:

```html
<div id="container">
  <button>Click me!</button>
</div>
<pre id="output"></pre>
```

Here the button is inside another element, a {{HTMLElement("div")}} element. We say that the `<div>` element here is the **parent** of the element it contains. What happens if we add a click event handler to the parent, then click the button?

```js
const output = document.querySelector("#output");
function handleClick(e) {
  output.textContent += `You clicked on a ${e.currentTarget.tagName} element\n`;
}

const container = document.querySelector("#container");
container.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Setting a listener on a parent element', '100%', 200, "", "") }}

You'll see that the parent fires a click event when the user clicks the button:

```plain
You clicked on a DIV element
```

This makes sense: the button is inside the `<div>`, so when you click the button you're also implicitly clicking the element it is inside.

### Bubbling example

What happens if we add event listeners to the button _and_ the parent?

```html
<body>
  <div id="container">
    <button>Click me!</button>
  </div>
  <pre id="output"></pre>
</body>
```

Let's try adding click event handlers to the button, its parent (the `<div>`), and the {{HTMLElement("body")}} element that contains both of them:

```js
const output = document.querySelector("#output");
function handleClick(e) {
  output.textContent += `You clicked on a ${e.currentTarget.tagName} element\n`;
}

const container = document.querySelector("#container");
const button = document.querySelector("button");

document.body.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
container.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
button.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Bubbling example', '100%', 200, "", "") }}

You'll see that all three elements fire a click event when the user clicks the button:

```plain
You clicked on a BUTTON element
You clicked on a DIV element
You clicked on a BODY element
```

In this case:

- the click on the button fires first.
- followed by the click on its parent (the `<div>` element).
- followed by the click on the `<div>` element's parent (the `<body>` element).

We describe this by saying that the event **bubbles up** from the innermost element that was clicked.

This behavior can be useful and can also cause unexpected problems. In the next sections, we'll see a problem that it causes, and find the solution.

### Video player example

In this example our page contains a video, which is hidden initially, and a button labeled "Display video". We want the following interaction:

- When the user clicks the "Display video" button, show the box containing the video, but don't start playing the video yet.
- When the user clicks on the video, start playing the video.
- When the user clicks anywhere in the box outside the video, hide the box.

The HTML looks like this:

```html
<button>Display video</button>

<div class="hidden">
  <video>
    <source src="/shared-assets/videos/flower.webm" type="video/webm" />
    <p>
      Your browser doesn't support HTML video. Here is a
      <a href="rabbit320.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.
    </p>
  </video>
</div>
```

It includes:

- a `<button>` element.
- a `<div>` element which initially has a `class="hidden"` attribute.
- a `<video>` element nested inside the `<div>` element.

We're using CSS to hide elements with the `"hidden"` class set.

```css hidden
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: #eeeeee;
}

.hidden {
  display: none;
}

div video {
  padding: 40px;
  display: block;
  width: 400px;
  margin: 40px auto;
}
```

The JavaScript looks like this:

```js
const btn = document.querySelector("button");
const box = document.querySelector("div");
const video = document.querySelector("video");

btn.addEventListener("click", () => box.classList.remove("hidden"));
video.addEventListener("click", () => video.play());
box.addEventListener("click", () => box.classList.add("hidden"));
```

This adds three `'click'` event listeners:

- one on the `<button>`, which shows the `<div>` that contains the `<video>`.
- one on the `<video>`, which starts playing the video.
- one on the `<div>`, which hides the video.

Let's see how this works:

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Video_player_example', '100%', 500) }}

You should see that when you click the button, the box and the video it contains are shown. But then when you click the video, the video starts to play, but the box is hidden again!

The video is inside the `<div>` — it is part of it — so clicking the video runs _both_ the event handlers, causing this behavior.

### Fixing the problem with `stopPropagation()`

As we saw in the last section, event bubbling can sometimes create problems, but there is a way to prevent it.
The [`Event`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event) object has a function available on it called [`stopPropagation()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/stopPropagation) which, when called inside an event handler, prevents the event from bubbling up to any other elements.

We can fix our current problem by changing the JavaScript to this:

```js
const btn = document.querySelector("button");
const box = document.querySelector("div");
const video = document.querySelector("video");

btn.addEventListener("click", () => box.classList.remove("hidden"));

video.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  event.stopPropagation();
  video.play();
});

box.addEventListener("click", () => box.classList.add("hidden"));
```

All we're doing here is calling `stopPropagation()` on the event object in the handler for the `<video>` element's `'click'` event. This will stop that event from bubbling up to the box. Now try clicking the button and then the video:

{{EmbedLiveSample("Fixing the problem with stopPropagation()", '100%', 500)}}

```html hidden
<button>Display video</button>

<div class="hidden">
  <video>
    <source src="/shared-assets/videos/flower.webm" type="video/webm" />
    <p>
      Your browser doesn't support HTML video. Here is a
      <a href="rabbit320.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.
    </p>
  </video>
</div>
```

```css hidden
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: #eeeeee;
}

.hidden {
  display: none;
}

div video {
  padding: 40px;
  display: block;
  width: 400px;
  margin: 40px auto;
}
```

## Event capture

An alternative form of event propagation is _event capture_. This is like event bubbling but the order is reversed: instead of the event firing first on the innermost element targeted, and then on successively less nested elements, the event fires first on the _least nested_ element, and then on successively more nested elements, until the target is reached.

Event capture is disabled by default. To enable it you have to pass the `capture` option in `addEventListener()`.

This example is just like the [bubbling example](#bubbling_example) we saw earlier, except that we have used the `capture` option:

```html
<body>
  <div id="container">
    <button>Click me!</button>
  </div>
  <pre id="output"></pre>
</body>
```

```js
const output = document.querySelector("#output");
function handleClick(e) {
  output.textContent += `You clicked on a ${e.currentTarget.tagName} element\n`;
}

const container = document.querySelector("#container");
const button = document.querySelector("button");

document.body.addEventListener("click", handleClick, { capture: true });
container.addEventListener("click", handleClick, { capture: true });
button.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Event capture', '100%', 200, "", "") }}

In this case, the order of messages is reversed: the `<body>` event handler fires first, followed by the `<div>` event handler, followed by the `<button>` event handler:

```plain
You clicked on a BODY element
You clicked on a DIV element
You clicked on a BUTTON element
```

Why bother with both capturing and bubbling? In the bad old days, when browsers were much less cross-compatible than now, Netscape only used event capturing, and Internet Explorer used only event bubbling. When the W3C decided to try to standardize the behavior and reach a consensus, they ended up with this system that included both, which is what modern browsers implement.

By default almost all event handlers are registered in the bubbling phase, and this makes more sense most of the time.

## Event delegation

In the last section, we looked at a problem caused by event bubbling and how to fix it. Event bubbling isn't just annoying, though: it can be very useful. In particular, it enables **event delegation**. In this practice, when we want some code to run when the user interacts with any one of a large number of child elements, we set the event listener on their parent and have events that happen on them bubble up to their parent rather than having to set the event listener on every child individually.

Let's go back to our first example, where we set the background color of the whole page when the user clicked a button. Suppose that instead, the page is divided into 16 tiles, and we want to set each tile to a random color when the user clicks that tile.

Here's the HTML:

```html
<div id="container">
  <div class="tile"></div>
  <div class="tile"></div>
  <div class="tile"></div>
  <div class="tile"></div>
  <div class="tile"></div>
  <div class="tile"></div>
  <div class="tile"></div>
  <div class="tile"></div>
  <div class="tile"></div>
  <div class="tile"></div>
  <div class="tile"></div>
  <div class="tile"></div>
  <div class="tile"></div>
  <div class="tile"></div>
  <div class="tile"></div>
  <div class="tile"></div>
</div>
```

We have a little CSS, to set the size and position of the tiles:

```css
#container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  grid-auto-rows: 100px;
}
```

Now in JavaScript, we could add a click event handler for every tile. But a much simpler and more efficient option is to set the click event handler on the parent, and rely on event bubbling to ensure that the handler is executed when the user clicks on a tile:

```js
function random(number) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * number);
}

function bgChange() {
  const rndCol = `rgb(${random(255)} ${random(255)} ${random(255)})`;
  return rndCol;
}

const container = document.querySelector("#container");

container.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  event.target.style.backgroundColor = bgChange();
});
```

The output is as follows (try clicking around on it):

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Event delegation', '100%', 430, "", "") }}

> [!NOTE]
> In this example, we're using `event.target` to get the element that was the target of the event (that is, the innermost element). If we wanted to access the element that handled this event (in this case the container) we could use `event.currentTarget`.

> [!NOTE]
> See [useful-eventtarget.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/building-blocks/events/useful-eventtarget.html) for the full source code; also see it [running live](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/building-blocks/events/useful-eventtarget.html) here.

## `target` and `currentTarget`

If you look closely at the examples we've introduced in this page, you'll see that we're using two different properties of the event object to access the element that was clicked. In [Setting a listener on a parent element](#setting_a_listener_on_a_parent_element) we're using {{domxref("Event.currentTarget", "event.currentTarget")}}. However, in [Event delegation](#event_delegation), we're using {{domxref("Event.target", "event.target")}}.

The difference is that `target` refers to the element on which the event was initially fired, while `currentTarget` refers to the element to which this event handler has been attached.

While `target` remains the same while an event bubbles up, `currentTarget` will be different for event handlers that are attached to different elements in the hierarchy.

We can see this if we slightly adapt the [Bubbling example](#bubbling_example) above. We're using the same HTML as before:

```html
<body>
  <div id="container">
    <button>Click me!</button>
  </div>
  <pre id="output"></pre>
</body>
```

The JavaScript is almost the same, except we're logging both `target` and `currentTarget`:

```js
const output = document.querySelector("#output");
function handleClick(e) {
  const logTarget = `Target: ${e.target.tagName}`;
  const logCurrentTarget = `Current target: ${e.currentTarget.tagName}`;
  output.textContent += `${logTarget}, ${logCurrentTarget}\n`;
}

const container = document.querySelector("#container");
const button = document.querySelector("button");

document.body.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
container.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
button.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
```

Note that when we click the button, `target` is the button element every time, whether the event handler is attached to the button itself, to the `<div>`, or to the `<body>`. However `currentTarget` identifies the element whose event handler we are currently running:

{{embedlivesample("target and currentTarget")}}

The `target` property is commonly used in event delegation, as seen in our [Event delegation](#event_delegation) example above.

## Summary

You should now know all you need to know about web events at this early stage. As mentioned, events are not really part of the core JavaScript language — they are defined in browser Web APIs.

In the next article, we'll give you some tests that you can use to check how well you've understood and retained all the information we've given you on events.

# Introduction to events

{{PreviousMenuNext("Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Test_your_skills/Functions","Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Event_bubbling", "Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting")}}

Events are things that happen in the system you are programming, which the system tells you about so your code can react to them.
For example, if the user clicks a button on a webpage, you might want to react to that action by displaying an information box.
In this article, we discuss some important concepts surrounding events, and look at the fundamentals of how they work in browsers.

## What is an event?

Events are things that happen in the system you are programming — the system produces (or "fires") a signal of some kind when an event occurs, and provides a mechanism by which an action can be automatically taken (that is, some code running) when the event occurs.
Events are fired inside the browser window, and tend to be attached to a specific item that resides in it. This might be a single element, a set of elements, the HTML document loaded in the current tab, or the entire browser window.
There are many different types of events that can occur.

For example:

- The user selects, clicks, or hovers the cursor over a certain element.
- The user presses a key on the keyboard.
- The user resizes or closes the browser window.
- A web page finishes loading.
- A form is submitted.
- A video is played, paused, or ends.
- An error occurs.

You can gather from this (and from glancing at the [event index](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Events#event_index)) that there are **a lot** of events that can be fired.

To react to an event, you attach an **event listener** to it. This is a code feature that listens out for the event firing. When the event fires, an **event handler** function (referenced by, or contained inside the event listener) is called to respond to the event firing. When such a block of code is set up to run in response to an event, we say we are **registering an event handler**.

### An example: handling a click event

In the following example, we have a single {{htmlelement("button")}} in the page:

```html
<button>Change color</button>
```

```css hidden
button {
  margin: 10px;
}
```

Then we have some JavaScript. We'll look at this in more detail in the next section, but for now we can just say: it adds an event listener to the button's `"click"` event, and the contained handler function reacts to the event by setting the page background to a random color:

```js
const btn = document.querySelector("button");

function random(number) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (number + 1));
}

btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  const rndCol = `rgb(${random(255)} ${random(255)} ${random(255)})`;
  document.body.style.backgroundColor = rndCol;
});
```

The example output is as follows. Try clicking the button:

{{ EmbedLiveSample('An example: handling a click event', '100%', 200, "", "") }}

## Using addEventListener()

As we saw in the last example, objects that can fire events have an {{domxref("EventTarget/addEventListener", "addEventListener()")}} method, and this is the recommended mechanism for adding event listeners.

Let's take a closer look at the code from the last example:

```js
const btn = document.querySelector("button");

function random(number) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (number + 1));
}

btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  const rndCol = `rgb(${random(255)} ${random(255)} ${random(255)})`;
  document.body.style.backgroundColor = rndCol;
});
```

The HTML {{HTMLElement("button")}} element will fire a `click` event when the user clicks it. We call the `addEventListener()` method on it to add an event listener; this takes two parameters:

- the string `"click"`, to indicate that we want to listen to the `click` event. Buttons can fire lots of other events, such as [`"mouseover"`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mouseover_event) when the user moves their mouse over the button, or [`"keydown"`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/keydown_event) when the user presses a key and the button is focused.
- a function to call when the event happens. In our case, the defined anonymous function generates a random RGB color and sets the [`background-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color) of the page [`<body>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/body) to that color.

You could also create a separate named function, and reference that in the second parameter of `addEventListener()`, like this:

```js
const btn = document.querySelector("button");

function random(number) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (number + 1));
}

function changeBackground() {
  const rndCol = `rgb(${random(255)} ${random(255)} ${random(255)})`;
  document.body.style.backgroundColor = rndCol;
}

btn.addEventListener("click", changeBackground);
```

### Listening for other events

There are many different events that can be fired by a button element. Let's experiment.

First, make a local copy of [random-color-addeventlistener.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/building-blocks/events/random-color-addeventlistener.html), and open it in your browser.
It's just a copy of the simple random color example we've played with already. Now try changing `click` to the following different values in turn, and observing the results in the example:

- [`focus`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/focus_event) and [`blur`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/blur_event) — The color changes when the button is focused and unfocused; try pressing the tab to focus on the button and press the tab again to focus away from the button.
  These are often used to display information about filling in form fields when they are focused, or to display an error message if a form field is filled with an incorrect value.
- [`dblclick`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/dblclick_event) — The color changes only when the button is double-clicked.
- [`mouseover`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mouseover_event) and [`mouseout`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mouseout_event) — The color changes when the mouse pointer hovers over the button, or when the pointer moves off the button, respectively.

Some events, such as `click`, are available on nearly any element. Others are more specific and only useful in certain situations: for example, the [`play`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/play_event) event is only available on elements that have play functionality, such as {{htmlelement("video")}}.

### Removing listeners

If you've added an event listener using `addEventListener()`, you can remove it again if desired. The most common way to do this is by using the [`removeEventListener()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/removeEventListener) method. For example, the following line would remove the `click` event handler we saw previously:

```js
btn.removeEventListener("click", changeBackground);
```

For simple, small programs, cleaning up old, unused event handlers isn't necessary, but for larger, more complex programs, it can improve efficiency.
Also, the ability to remove event handlers allows you to have the same button performing different actions in different circumstances: all you have to do is add or remove handlers.

### Adding multiple listeners for a single event

By making more than one call to {{domxref("EventTarget/addEventListener()", "addEventListener()")}}, providing different handlers, you can have multiple handler functions running in response to a single event:

```js
myElement.addEventListener("click", functionA);
myElement.addEventListener("click", functionB);
```

Both functions would now run when the element is clicked.

## Other event listener mechanisms

We recommend that you use `addEventListener()` to register event handlers. It's the most powerful method and scales best with more complex programs. However, there are two other ways of registering event handlers that you might see: _event handler properties_ and _inline event handlers_.

### Event handler properties

Objects (such as buttons) that can fire events also usually have properties whose name is `on` followed by the name of an event. For example, elements have a property `onclick`.
This is called an **event handler property**. To listen for the event, you can assign the handler function to the property.

For example, we could rewrite the random color example like this:

```js
const btn = document.querySelector("button");

function random(number) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (number + 1));
}

btn.onclick = () => {
  const rndCol = `rgb(${random(255)} ${random(255)} ${random(255)})`;
  document.body.style.backgroundColor = rndCol;
};
```

You can also set the handler property to a named function:

```js
const btn = document.querySelector("button");

function random(number) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (number + 1));
}

function bgChange() {
  const rndCol = `rgb(${random(255)} ${random(255)} ${random(255)})`;
  document.body.style.backgroundColor = rndCol;
}

btn.onclick = bgChange;
```

Event handler properties have disadvantages compared to `addEventListener()`. One of the most significant is that you can't [add more than one listener for a single event](#adding_multiple_listeners_for_a_single_event). The following pattern doesn't work, because any subsequent attempts to set the property value will overwrite earlier ones:

```js
element.onclick = function1;
element.onclick = function2;
```

### Inline event handlers — don't use these

You might also see a pattern like this in your code:

```html example-bad
<button onclick="bgChange()">Press me</button>
```

```js
function bgChange() {
  const rndCol = `rgb(${random(255)} ${random(255)} ${random(255)})`;
  document.body.style.backgroundColor = rndCol;
}
```

The earliest method of registering event handlers found on the Web involved [_event handler HTML attributes_](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes#event_handler_attributes) (or _inline event handlers_) like the one shown above — the attribute value contains the JavaScript code you want to run when the event occurs.
The above example invokes a function defined inside a {{htmlelement("script")}} element on the same page, but you could also insert JavaScript directly inside the attribute, for example:

```html example-bad
<button onclick="alert('Hello, this is my old-fashioned event handler!');">
  Press me
</button>
```

You can find HTML attribute equivalents for many of the event handler properties; however, you shouldn't use these — they are considered bad practice.
It might seem easy to use an event handler attribute if you are doing something really quick, but they quickly become unmanageable and inefficient.

For a start, it is not a good idea to mix up your HTML and your JavaScript, as it becomes hard to read. Keeping your JavaScript separate is a good practice, and if it is in a separate file you can apply it to multiple HTML documents.

Even in a single file, inline event handlers are not a good idea.
One button is OK, but what if you had 100 buttons? You'd have to add 100 attributes to the file; it would quickly turn into a maintenance nightmare.
With JavaScript, you could easily add an event handler function to all the buttons on the page no matter how many there were, using something like this:

```js
const buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button");

for (const button of buttons) {
  button.addEventListener("click", bgChange);
}
```

Finally, many common server configurations will disallow inline JavaScript, as a security measure.

**You should never use the HTML event handler attributes** — those are outdated, and using them is bad practice.

## Event objects

Sometimes, inside an event handler function, you'll see a parameter specified with a name such as `event`, `evt`, or `e`.
This is called the **event object**, and it is automatically passed to event handlers to provide extra features and information.
For example, let's rewrite our random color example to include an event object:

```js
const btn = document.querySelector("button");

function random(number) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (number + 1));
}

function bgChange(e) {
  const rndCol = `rgb(${random(255)} ${random(255)} ${random(255)})`;
  e.target.style.backgroundColor = rndCol;
  console.log(e);
}

btn.addEventListener("click", bgChange);
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can find the [full source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/building-blocks/events/random-color-eventobject.html) for this example on GitHub (also [see it running live](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/building-blocks/events/random-color-eventobject.html)).

Here you can see we are including an event object, **e**, in the function, and in the function setting a background color style on `e.target` — which is the button itself.
The `target` property of the event object is always a reference to the element the event occurred upon.
So, in this example, we are setting a random background color on the button, not the page.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use any name you like for the event object — you just need to choose a name that you can reference inside the event handler function.
> `e`, `evt`, and `event` are commonly used by developers because they are short and easy to remember.
> It's always good to be consistent — with yourself, and with others if possible.

### Extra properties of event objects

Most event objects have a standard set of properties and methods available on the event object; see the {{domxref("Event")}} object reference for a full list.

Some event objects add extra properties that are relevant to that particular type of event. For example, the {{domxref("Element/keydown_event", "keydown")}} event fires when the user presses a key. Its event object is a {{domxref("KeyboardEvent")}}, which is a specialized `Event` object with a `key` property that tells you which key was pressed:

```html
<input id="textBox" type="text" />
<div id="output"></div>
```

```js
const textBox = document.querySelector("#textBox");
const output = document.querySelector("#output");
textBox.addEventListener("keydown", (event) => {
  output.textContent = `You pressed "${event.key}".`;
});
```

```css hidden
div {
  margin: 0.5rem 0;
}
```

Try typing into the text box and see the output:

{{EmbedLiveSample("Extra_properties_of_event_objects", 100, 100)}}

## Preventing default behavior

Sometimes, you'll come across a situation where you want to prevent an event from doing what it does by default.
The most common example is that of a web form, for example, a custom registration form.
When you fill in the details and click the submit button, the natural behavior is for the data to be submitted to a specified page on the server for processing, and the browser to be redirected to a "success message" page of some kind (or the same page, if another is not specified).

The trouble comes when the user has not submitted the data correctly — as a developer, you want to prevent the submission to the server and give an error message saying what's wrong and what needs to be done to put things right.
Some browsers support automatic form data validation features, but since many don't, you are advised to not rely on those and implement your own validation checks.
Let's look at an example.

First, a simple HTML form that requires you to enter your first and last name:

```html
<form action="#">
  <div>
    <label for="fname">First name: </label>
    <input id="fname" type="text" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="lname">Last name: </label>
    <input id="lname" type="text" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <input id="submit" type="submit" />
  </div>
</form>
<p></p>
```

```css hidden
div {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}
```

Now some JavaScript — here we implement a basic check inside a handler for the [`submit`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/submit_event) event (the submit event is fired on a form when it is submitted) that tests whether the text fields are empty.
If they are, we call the [`preventDefault()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault) function on the event object — which stops the form submission — and then display an error message in the paragraph below our form to tell the user what's wrong:

```js
const form = document.querySelector("form");
const fname = document.getElementById("fname");
const lname = document.getElementById("lname");
const para = document.querySelector("p");

form.addEventListener("submit", (e) => {
  if (fname.value === "" || lname.value === "") {
    e.preventDefault();
    para.textContent = "You need to fill in both names!";
  }
});
```

Obviously, this is pretty weak form validation — it wouldn't stop the user from validating the form with spaces or numbers entered into the fields, for example — but it is OK for example purposes.

You can see the full example [running live](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/building-blocks/events/preventdefault-validation.html) — try it out there. For the full source code, see [preventdefault-validation.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/building-blocks/events/preventdefault-validation.html).

## It's not just web pages

Events are not unique to JavaScript — most programming languages have some kind of event model, and the way the model works often differs from JavaScript's way.
In fact, the event model in JavaScript for web pages differs from the event model for JavaScript as it is used in other environments.

For example, [Node.js](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side/Express_Nodejs) is a very popular JavaScript runtime that enables developers to use JavaScript to build network and server-side applications.
The [Node.js event model](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html) relies on listeners to listen for events and emitters to emit events periodically — it doesn't sound that different, but the code is quite different, making use of functions like `on()` to register an event listener, and `once()` to register an event listener that unregisters after it has run once.
The Node.js [HTTP connect event docs](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#event-connect) provide a good example.

You can also use JavaScript to build cross-browser add-ons — browser functionality enhancements — using a technology called [WebExtensions](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions).
The event model is similar to the web events model, but a bit different — event listener properties are written in {{Glossary("camel_case", "camel case")}} (such as `onMessage` rather than `onmessage`), and need to be combined with the `addListener` function.
See the [`runtime.onMessage`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/runtime/onMessage#examples) page for an example.

You don't need to understand anything about other such environments at this stage in your learning; we just wanted to make it clear that events can differ in different programming environments.

## Summary

In this chapter we've learned what events are, how to listen for events, and how to respond to them.

You've seen by now that elements in a web page can be nested inside other elements. For example, in the [Preventing default behavior](#preventing_default_behavior) example, we have some text boxes, placed inside {{htmlelement("div")}} elements, which in turn are placed inside a {{htmlelement("form")}} element. What happens when a click event listener is attached to the `<form>` element, and the user clicks inside one of the text boxes? The associated event handler function is still fired via a process called _event bubbling_, which is covered in the next lesson.

# Functions — reusable blocks of code

{{PreviousMenuNext("Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Test_your_skills/Loops","Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Build_your_own_function", "Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting")}}

Another essential concept in coding is **functions**, which allow you to store a piece of code that does a single task inside a defined block, and then call that code whenever you need it using a single short command — rather than having to type out the same code multiple times. In this article we'll explore fundamental concepts behind functions such as basic syntax, how to invoke and define them, scope, and parameters.

## Where do I find functions?

In JavaScript, you'll find functions everywhere. In fact, we've been using functions all the way through the course so far; we've just not been talking about them very much. Now is the time, however, for us to start talking about functions explicitly, and really exploring their syntax.

Pretty much anytime you make use of a JavaScript structure that features a pair of parentheses — `()` — and you're **not** using a common built-in language structure like a [for loop](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Loops#the_standard_for_loop), [while or do...while loop](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Loops#while_and_do...while), or [if...else statement](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Conditionals#if...else_statements), you are making use of a function.

## Built-in browser functions

We've used functions built into the browser a lot in this course.

Every time we manipulated a text string, for example:

```js
const myText = "I am a string";
const newString = myText.replace("string", "sausage");
console.log(newString);
// the replace() string function takes a source string,
// and a target string and replaces the source string,
// with the target string, and returns the newly formed string
```

Or every time we manipulated an array:

```js
const myArray = ["I", "love", "chocolate", "frogs"];
const madeAString = myArray.join(" ");
console.log(madeAString);
// the join() function takes an array, joins
// all the array items together into a single
// string, and returns this new string
```

Or every time we generate a random number:

```js
const myNumber = Math.random();
// the random() function generates a random number between
// 0 and up to but not including 1, and returns that number
```

We were using a _function_!

> [!NOTE]
> Feel free to enter these lines into your browser's JavaScript console to re-familiarize yourself with their functionality, if needed.

The JavaScript language has many built-in functions to allow you to do useful things without having to write all that code yourself. In fact, some of the code you are calling when you **invoke** (a fancy word for run, or execute) a built-in browser function couldn't be written in JavaScript — many of these functions are calling parts of the background browser code, which is written largely in low-level system languages like C++, not web languages like JavaScript.

Bear in mind that some built-in browser functions are not part of the core JavaScript language — some are defined as part of browser APIs, which build on top of the default language to provide even more functionality (refer to [this early section of our course](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/What_is_JavaScript#so_what_can_it_really_do) for more descriptions). We'll look at using browser APIs in more detail in a later module.

## Functions versus methods

**Functions** that are part of objects are called **methods**; you'll learn about objects later in the module. For now, we just wanted to clear up any possible confusion about method versus function — you are likely to meet both terms as you look at the available related resources across the Web.

The built-in code we've made use of so far comes in both forms: **functions** and **methods.** You can check the full list of the built-in functions, as well as the built-in objects and their corresponding methods [in our JavaScript reference](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects).

You've also seen a lot of **custom functions** in the course so far — functions defined in your code, not inside the browser. Anytime you saw a custom name with parentheses straight after it, you were using a custom function. In our [random-canvas-circles.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/building-blocks/loops/random-canvas-circles.html) example (see also the full [source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/building-blocks/loops/random-canvas-circles.html)) from our [loops article](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Loops), we included a custom `draw()` function that looked like this:

```js
function draw() {
  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.fillStyle = "rgb(255 0 0 / 50%)";
    ctx.arc(random(WIDTH), random(HEIGHT), random(50), 0, 2 * Math.PI);
    ctx.fill();
  }
}
```

This function draws 100 random circles inside a {{htmlelement("canvas")}} element. Every time we want to do that, we can just invoke the function with this:

```js
draw();
```

rather than having to write all that code out again every time we want to repeat it. Functions can contain whatever code you like — you can even call other functions from inside functions. The above function for example calls the `random()` function three times, which is defined by the following code:

```js
function random(number) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * number);
}
```

We needed this function because the browser's built-in [`Math.random()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random) function only generates a random decimal number between 0 and 1. We wanted a random whole number between 0 and a specified number.

## Invoking functions

You are probably clear on this by now, but just in case, to actually use a function after it has been defined, you've got to run — or invoke — it. This is done by including the name of the function in the code somewhere, followed by parentheses.

```js
function myFunction() {
  alert("hello");
}

myFunction();
// calls the function once
```

> [!NOTE]
> This form of creating a function is also known as _function declaration_. It is always hoisted so that you can call the function above the function definition and it will work fine.

## Function parameters

Some functions require **parameters** to be specified when you are invoking them — these are values that need to be included inside the function parentheses, which it needs to do its job properly.

> [!NOTE]
> Parameters are sometimes called arguments, properties, or even attributes.

As an example, the browser's built-in [`Math.random()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random) function doesn't require any parameters. When called, it always returns a random number between 0 and 1:

```js
const myNumber = Math.random();
```

The browser's built-in string [`replace()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace) function however needs two parameters — the substring to find in the main string, and the substring to replace that string with:

```js
const myText = "I am a string";
const newString = myText.replace("string", "sausage");
```

> [!NOTE]
> When you need to specify multiple parameters, they are separated by commas.

### Optional parameters

Sometimes parameters are optional — you don't have to specify them. If you don't, the function will generally adopt some kind of default behavior. As an example, the array [`join()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join) function's parameter is optional:

```js
const myArray = ["I", "love", "chocolate", "frogs"];
const madeAString = myArray.join(" ");
console.log(madeAString);
// returns 'I love chocolate frogs'

const madeAnotherString = myArray.join();
console.log(madeAnotherString);
// returns 'I,love,chocolate,frogs'
```

If no parameter is included to specify a joining/delimiting character, a comma is used by default.

### Default parameters

If you're writing a function and want to support optional parameters, you can specify default values by adding `=` after the name of the parameter, followed by the default value:

```js
function hello(name = "Chris") {
  console.log(`Hello ${name}!`);
}

hello("Ari"); // Hello Ari!
hello(); // Hello Chris!
```

## Anonymous functions and arrow functions

So far we have just created a function like so:

```js
function myFunction() {
  alert("hello");
}
```

But you can also create a function that doesn't have a name:

```js
(function () {
  alert("hello");
});
```

This is called an **anonymous function**, because it has no name. You'll often see anonymous functions when a function expects to receive another function as a parameter. In this case, the function parameter is often passed as an anonymous function.

> [!NOTE]
> This form of creating a function is also known as _function expression_. Unlike function declarations, function expressions are not hoisted.

### Anonymous function example

For example, let's say you want to run some code when the user types into a text box. To do this you can call the {{domxref("EventTarget/addEventListener", "addEventListener()")}} function of the text box. This function expects you to pass it (at least) two parameters:

- the name of the event to listen for, which in this case is {{domxref("Element/keydown_event", "keydown")}}
- a function to run when the event happens.

When the user presses a key, the browser will call the function you provided, and will pass it a parameter containing information about this event, including the particular key that the user pressed:

```js
function logKey(event) {
  console.log(`You pressed "${event.key}".`);
}

textBox.addEventListener("keydown", logKey);
```

Instead of defining a separate `logKey()` function, you can pass an anonymous function into `addEventListener()`:

```js
textBox.addEventListener("keydown", function (event) {
  console.log(`You pressed "${event.key}".`);
});
```

### Arrow functions

If you pass an anonymous function like this, there's an alternative form you can use, called an **arrow function**. Instead of `function(event)`, you write `(event) =>`:

```js
textBox.addEventListener("keydown", (event) => {
  console.log(`You pressed "${event.key}".`);
});
```

If the function only takes one parameter, you can omit the parentheses around the parameter:

```js-nolint
textBox.addEventListener("keydown", event => {
  console.log(`You pressed "${event.key}".`);
});
```

Finally, if your function contains only one line that's a `return` statement, you can also omit the braces and the `return` keyword and implicitly return the expression. In the following example, we're using the {{jsxref("Array.prototype.map()","map()")}} method of `Array` to double every value in the original array:

```js-nolint
const originals = [1, 2, 3];

const doubled = originals.map(item => item * 2);

console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6]
```

The `map()` method takes each item in the array in turn, passing it into the given function. It then takes the value returned by that function and adds it to a new array.

So in the example above, `item => item * 2` is the arrow function equivalent of:

```js
function doubleItem(item) {
  return item * 2;
}
```

You can use the same concise syntax to rewrite the `addEventListener` example.

```js
textBox.addEventListener("keydown", (event) =>
  console.log(`You pressed "${event.key}".`),
);
```

In this case, the value of `console.log()`, which is `undefined`, is implicitly returned from the callback function.

We recommend that you use arrow functions, as they can make your code shorter and more readable. To learn more, see the [section on arrow functions in the JavaScript guide](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions#arrow_functions), and our [reference page on arrow functions](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions).

> [!NOTE]
> There are some subtle differences between arrow functions and normal functions. They're outside the scope of this introductory tutorial and are unlikely to make a difference in the cases we've discussed here. To learn more, see the [arrow function reference documentation](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions).

### Arrow function live sample

Here's a complete working example of the "keydown" example we discussed above:

The HTML:

```html
<input id="textBox" type="text" />
<div id="output"></div>
```

The JavaScript:

```js
const textBox = document.querySelector("#textBox");
const output = document.querySelector("#output");

textBox.addEventListener("keydown", (event) => {
  output.textContent = `You pressed "${event.key}".`;
});
```

```css hidden
div {
  margin: 0.5rem 0;
}
```

The result - try typing into the text box and see the output:

## Function scope and conflicts

Let's talk a bit about {{glossary("scope")}} — a very important concept when dealing with functions. When you create a function, the variables and other things defined inside the function are inside their own separate **scope**, meaning that they are locked away in their own separate compartments, unreachable from code outside the functions.

The top-level outside all your functions is called the **global scope**. Values defined in the global scope are accessible from everywhere in the code.

JavaScript is set up like this for various reasons — but mainly because of security and organization. Sometimes you don't want variables to be accessible from everywhere in the code. External scripts that you call in from elsewhere could start to mess with your code and cause problems because they happen to be using the same variable names as other parts of the code, causing conflicts. This might be done maliciously, or just by accident.

For example, say you have an HTML file referencing two external JavaScript files, and both of them have a variable and a function defined that use the same name:

```html
<!-- Excerpt from the HTML -->
<script src="first.js"></script>
<script src="second.js"></script>
<script>
  greeting();
</script>
```

```js
// first.js
const name = "Chris";
function greeting() {
  alert(`Hello ${name}: welcome to our company.`);
}
```

```js
// second.js
const name = "Zaptec";
function greeting() {
  alert(`Our company is called ${name}.`);
}
```

You can see this example [running live on GitHub](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/building-blocks/functions/conflict.html) (see also the [source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/tree/main/javascript/building-blocks/functions)). Load it in a separate browser tab before reading the explanation below.

- When the example renders in a browser, you will first see an alert box displaying `Hello Chris: welcome to our company.`, meaning that the `greeting()` function defined inside the first script file has been called by the `greeting()` call inside the internal script.

- The second script, however, does not load and run at all, and an error is printed in the console: `Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been declared`. This is because the `name` constant is already declared in `first.js`, and you can't declare the same constant twice in the same scope. Because the second script did not load, the `greeting()` function from `second.js` is not available to be called.

- If we were to remove the `const name = "Zaptec";` line from `second.js` and reload the page, both scripts would execute. The alert box would now say `Our company is called Chris.` Functions _can_ be redeclared, and the last declaration in the source order is used. The previous declarations are effectively overwritten.

Keeping parts of your code locked away in functions avoids such problems, and is considered a best practice.

It is a bit like a zoo. The lions, zebras, tigers, and penguins are kept in their own enclosures and only have access to the things inside — in the same manner as the function scopes. If they were able to get into other enclosures, problems would occur. At best, different animals would feel really uncomfortable inside unfamiliar habitats — a lion or tiger would feel terrible inside the penguins' watery, icy domain. At worst, the lions and tigers might try to eat the penguins!

![Four different animals enclosed in their respective habitat in a Zoo](mdn-mozilla-zoo.png)

The zoo keeper is like the global scope — they have the keys to access every enclosure, restock food, tend to sick animals, etc.

### Playing with scope

Let's look at a real example to demonstrate scoping.

1. First, make a local copy of our [function-scope.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/building-blocks/functions/function-scope.html) example. This contains two functions called `a()` and `b()`, and three variables — `x`, `y`, and `z` — two of which are defined inside the functions, and one in the global scope. It also contains a third function called `output()`, which takes a single parameter and outputs it in a paragraph on the page.
2. Open the example up in a browser and in your text editor.
3. Open the JavaScript console in your browser developer tools. In the JavaScript console, enter the following command:

   ```js
   output(x);
   ```

   You should see the value of variable `x` printed to the browser viewport.

4. Now try entering the following in your console

   ```js
   output(y);
   output(z);
   ```

   Both of these should throw an error into the console along the lines of "[ReferenceError: y is not defined](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Not_defined)". Why is that? Because of function scope: `y` and `z` are locked inside the `a()` and `b()` functions, so `output()` can't access them when called from the global scope.

5. However, what about when it's called from inside another function? Try editing `a()` and `b()` so they look like this:

   ```js
   function a() {
     const y = 2;
     output(y);
   }

   function b() {
     const z = 3;
     output(z);
   }
   ```

   Save the code and reload it in your browser, then try calling the `a()` and `b()` functions from the JavaScript console:

   ```js
   a();
   b();
   ```

   You should see the `y` and `z` values printed in the browser viewport. This works fine, as the `output()` function is being called inside the other functions, in the same scope as the variables it is printing are defined in. `output()` itself is available from anywhere, as it is defined in the global scope.

6. Now try updating your code like this:

   ```js
   function a() {
     const y = 2;
     output(x);
   }

   function b() {
     const z = 3;
     output(x);
   }
   ```

7. Save and reload again, and try this again in your JavaScript console:

   ```js
   a();
   b();
   ```

   Both the `a()` and `b()` call should print the value of x to the browser viewport. These work fine because even though the `output()` calls are not in the same scope as `x` is defined in, `x` is a global variable so is available inside all code, everywhere.

8. Finally, try updating your code like this:

   ```js
   function a() {
     const y = 2;
     output(z);
   }

   function b() {
     const z = 3;
     output(y);
   }
   ```

9. Save and reload again, and try this again in your JavaScript console:

   ```js
   a();
   b();
   ```

   This time the `a()` and `b()` calls will throw that annoying [ReferenceError: _variable name_ is not defined](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Not_defined) error into the console — this is because the `output()` calls and the variables they are trying to print are not in the same function scopes — the variables are effectively invisible to those function calls.

> [!NOTE]
> The same scoping rules do not apply to loop (e.g., `for() { }`) and conditional blocks (e.g., `if () { }`) — they look very similar, but they are not the same thing! Take care not to get these confused.

> [!NOTE]
> The [ReferenceError: "x" is not defined](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Not_defined) error is one of the most common you'll encounter. If you get this error and you are sure that you have defined the variable in question, check what scope it is in.

# Challenge: Building a house data UI

{{PreviousMenuNext("Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Test_your_skills/JSON", "Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Debugging_JavaScript", "Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting")}}

In this challenge we are going to get you to write some JavaScript for a house search/filter page on a property website. This will include fetching JSON data, filtering that data based on the values entered in provided form controls, and rendering that data to the UI. Along the way, we'll also test your knowledge of conditionals, loops, arrays and array methods, and more besides.

## Starting point

To begin, click the **Play** button in one of the code panels below to open the provided example in the MDN Playground. You'll then follow the instructions in the [Project brief](#project_brief) section to complete the JavaScript functionality.

```html live-sample___house-ui-start live-sample___house-ui-finish

## Project brief

You have been provided with an HTML index page containing a form allowing the user to search for houses by street, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms, plus a couple of elements to contain search results. You've also been provided with a JavaScript file containing some constant and variable definitions, plus a couple of skeleton function definitions. Your job is to fill in the missing JavaScript to make the house search interface work.

The provided constant and variable definitions hold the following references:

- `streetSelect`: The "choose-street" `<select>` element.
- `bedroomSelect`: The "choose-bedrooms" `<select>` element.
- `bathroomSelect`: The "choose-bathrooms" `<select>` element.
- `form`: The overall `<form>` element that contains the `<select>` elements.
- `resultCount`: The "result-count" `<p>` element, which updates to display the number of results returned after each search.
- `output`: The "output" `<section>` element, which displays the search results.
- `houses`: Initially empty, but this will contain the house data object created by parsing the fetched JSON data.

The skeleton functions are:

- `initializeForm()`: This will query the data and populate the `<select>` elements with the possible values that could be searched for.
- `renderHouses()`: This will filter the data based on the `<select>` element values, and render the results.

### Fetching the data

The first thing you need to do is create a new function to fetch the house data and store it in the `houses` variable.

To do so:

1. Create a new function just below the variable and constant definitions called `fetchHouseData()`.
2. Inside the body of the function, use the `fetch()` method to fetch the JSON found at [https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/misc/houses.json](https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/misc/houses.json). You should study the structure of this data in preparation for some of the later steps.
3. When the resulting promise resolves, check the `ok` property of the response. If it is `false`, throw a custom error that reports the response's `status`.
4. Provided the response is ok, return the response as JSON using the `json()` method.
5. When the resulting promise resolves, set the `houses` variable equal to the result of the `json()` method (this should be an array of objects containing house data), and call the `initializeForm()` function.

### Completing the `initializeForm()` function

Now you need to write the contents of the `initializeForm()` function. This will query the data stored inside `houses` and use it to populate the `<select>` elements with `<option>` elements representing all of the different values that could be filtered for. At the moment, the `<select>` elements only contain a single `<option>` element with a value of `""` (an empty string), which represents all values. The user can choose this option if they don't want the results to be filtered by that field.

Inside the function body, write code that does the following:

1. Create `<option>` elements for all the different street names inside the "choose-street" `<select>`. There are a few ways you could do this, but we'd recommend creating a temporary array then looping through all the objects inside `houses`. Inside the loop, check whether your temporary array includes the `street` property of the current house. If not, add it to the temporary array and add an `<option>` to the "choose-street" `<select>` that includes the `street` property as its value.
2. Create options for all the possible bedroom number values inside the "choose-bedrooms" `<select>`. To do this, you could loop through the `houses` array and determine what the largest `bedrooms` value is, then write a second loop that adds an `<option>` to the "choose-bedrooms" `<select>` for each number from `1` to that largest value.
3. Create options for all the possible bathroom number values inside the "choose-bathrooms" `<select>`. This can be solved using the same technique as the previous step.

> [!NOTE]
> You _could_ just hardcode the `<option>` elements inside the HTML, but that would only work for this exact data set. We want you to write JavaScript that will correctly populate the form regardless of the data values provided (each house object would have to have the same structure).

> [!NOTE]
> You could use the `innerHTML` property to add child content inside HTML elements, but we'd recommend not doing so. You can't always trust the data you are adding to your page: If it is not properly sanitized on the server, bad actors could use `innerHTML` as a pathway to carry out [Cross-site scripting (XSS)](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/XSS) attacks on your page. A safer route is to use DOM scripting features such as `createElement()`, `appendChild()`, and `textContent`. Using `innerHTML` to remove child content isn't such an issue.

### Completing the `renderHouses()` function

Next, you need to complete the `renderHouses()` function body. This will filter the data based on the `<select>` element values, and render the results to the UI.

1. First, you need to filter the data. This is probably best achieved using the array `filter()` method, which returns a new array containing only the array elements that match the filter criteria.
   1. This is a fairly complex `filter()` function to write. You need to test whether the `street` property of the house is equal to the selected value of the "choose-street" `<select>`, and whether the `bedrooms` property of the house is equal to the selected value of the "choose-bedrooms" `<select>`, and whether the `bathrooms` property of the house is equal to the selected value of the "choose-bathrooms" `<select>`.
   2. Each component of the test always needs to return `true` if the associated `<select>` value is `""` (the empty string, which represents all values). You can achieve this by "short-circuiting" each check.
   3. You also need to make sure the data types match in each check. The value of a form element is always a string. This is not necessarily the case for your object property values. How can you make the data types match up for the purposes of the test?
2. Output the number of filtered search results into the "result-count" `<p>` element, using the string structure "Results returned: number".
3. Empty the "output" `<section>` element, so it doesn't have any child HTML elements. If you don't do this, each time a search is performed the results will be added to the end of the previous results rather than replacing them.
4. Create a new function inside `renderHouses()` called `renderHouse()`. This function needs to take a house object as an argument, and do two things:
   1. Calculate the total area of the rooms contained inside the house's `room_sizes` object. This isn't as straightforward as looping through an array of numbers and summing them, but it isn't too tricky.
   2. Add an `<article>` element inside the "output" `<section>` element containing the house's number, street name, bedroom and bathroom count, total room area, and price. you can vary the structure if you like, we we'd like it to be similar to this HTML snippet:
   ```html
   <article>
     <h2>number street name</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>🛏️ Bedrooms: number</li>
       <li>🛀 Bathrooms: number</li>
       <li>Room area: number m²</li>
       <li>Price: £price</li>
     </ul>
   </article>
   ```
5. Loop through all of the houses inside the filtered array and pass each one into a `renderHouse()` call.

## Hints and tips

- You don't need to alter the HTML or CSS in any way.
- For doing things like finding the largest value in an array of values, the `reduce()` array function is really handy. We've not taught it in this course, as it is quite complex, but it is really powerful when you get to grips with it. As a stretch goal, try researching it and using it in your answer.

## Example

Your finished app should work like the following live example:

{{EmbedLiveSample("house-ui-finish", "100%", 700)}}

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

The finished JavaScript should look something like this:

```js live-sample___house-ui-finish
const streetSelect = document.getElementById("choose-street");
const bedroomSelect = document.getElementById("choose-bedrooms");
const bathroomSelect = document.getElementById("choose-bathrooms");
const form = document.querySelector("form");
const resultCount = document.getElementById("result-count");
const output = document.getElementById("output");

let houses;

function fetchHouseData() {
  fetch("https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/misc/houses.json")
    .then((response) => {
      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(`HTTP error: ${response.status}`);
      }

      return response.json();
    })
    .then((json) => {
      houses = json;
      initializeForm();
    });
}

function initializeForm() {
  // Create options for all the different street names
  const streetArray = [];
  for (let house of houses) {
    if (!streetArray.includes(house.street)) {
      streetArray.push(house.street);
      streetSelect.appendChild(document.createElement("option")).textContent =
        house.street;
    }
  }

  // Create options for all the possible bedroom values
  const largestBedrooms = houses.reduce(
    (largest, house) => (house.bedrooms > largest ? house.bedrooms : largest),
    houses[0].bedrooms,
  );
  let i = 1;
  while (i <= largestBedrooms) {
    bedroomSelect.appendChild(document.createElement("option")).textContent = i;
    i++;
  }

  // Create options for all the possible bathroom values
  const largestBathrooms = houses.reduce(
    (largest, house) => (house.bathrooms > largest ? house.bathrooms : largest),
    houses[0].bathrooms,
  );
  let j = 1;
  while (j <= largestBathrooms) {
    bathroomSelect.appendChild(document.createElement("option")).textContent =
      j;
    j++;
  }
}

function renderHouses(e) {
  // Stop the form submitting
  e.preventDefault();

  // Filter the data
  const filteredHouses = houses.filter((house) => {
    // prettier-ignore
    const test = (streetSelect.value === "" ||
                  house.street === streetSelect.value) &&
                 (bedroomSelect.value === "" ||
                  String(house.bedrooms) === bedroomSelect.value) &&
                 (bathroomSelect.value === "" ||
                  String(house.bathrooms) === bathroomSelect.value);
    return test;
  });

  // Output the result count to the "result-count" paragraph
  resultCount.textContent = `Results returned: ${filteredHouses.length}`;

  // Empty the output element
  output.innerHTML = "";

  // Create renderHouse() function
  function renderHouse(house) {
    // Calculate total room size
    let totalArea = 0;
    const keys = Object.keys(house.room_sizes);
    for (let key of keys) {
      totalArea += house.room_sizes[key];
    }

    // Output house to UI
    const articleElem = document.createElement("article");
    articleElem.appendChild(document.createElement("h2")).textContent =
      `${house.house_number} ${house.street}`;
    const listElem = document.createElement("ul");
    listElem.appendChild(document.createElement("li")).textContent =
      `🛏️ Bedrooms: ${house.bedrooms}`;
    listElem.appendChild(document.createElement("li")).textContent =
      `🛀 Bathrooms: ${house.bathrooms}`;
    listElem.appendChild(document.createElement("li")).textContent =
      `Room area: ${totalArea}m²`;
    listElem.appendChild(document.createElement("li")).textContent =
      `Price: £${house.price}`;
    articleElem.appendChild(listElem);
    output.appendChild(articleElem);
  }

  // Pass each house in the filtered array into renderHouse()
  for (let house of filteredHouses) {
    renderHouse(house);
  }
}

// Add a submit listener to the <form> element
form.addEventListener("submit", renderHouses);

// Call fetchHouseData() to initialize the app
fetchHouseData();
```

# Challenge: Image gallery

{{PreviousMenuNext("Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/DOM_scripting","Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Network_requests", "Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting")}}

In this challenge, we'll get you to build a fairly common item you'll see on a lot of websites — a JavaScript-powered image gallery. Along the way, you'll be tested on your knowledge of loops, functions, conditionals, events, DOM scripting, and object basics.

## Starting point

To begin, click the **Play** button in one of the code panels below to open the provided example in the MDN Playground. You'll then follow the instructions in the [Project brief](#project_brief) section to complete the JavaScript functionality.

The HTML looks like so:

```html live-sample___gallery-start live-sample___gallery-finish
<h1>Image gallery example</h1>

<div class="full-img">
  <img
    class="displayed-img"
    src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/learn/gallery/pic1.jpg"
    alt="Closeup of a human eye" />
  <div class="overlay"></div>
  <button class="dark">Darken</button>
</div>

<div class="thumb-bar"></div>
```

The starting JavaScript looks like this:

```js live-sample___gallery-start
const displayedImage = document.querySelector(".displayed-img");
const thumbBar = document.querySelector(".thumb-bar");

const btn = document.querySelector("button");
const overlay = document.querySelector(".overlay");

// 1. Declare an array of objects containing image file names & alt text

// 2. Loop through the images

// 3. Create the updateDisplayedImage() function

// 4. Wire up the Darken/Lighten button
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("gallery-start", "100%", 700)}}

```css hidden live-sample___gallery-start live-sample___gallery-finish
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  width: 640px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  background-color: lightgray;
}

h1 {
  text-align: center;
}

.full-img {
  position: relative;
  display: block;
  width: 640px;
  height: 480px;
  margin-bottom: 2px;
}

.overlay {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 640px;
  height: 480px;
}

button {
  background: rgb(150 150 150 / 0.6);
  border: 1px solid #999999;
  position: absolute;
  cursor: pointer;
  top: 2px;
  left: 2px;
}

button:hover,
button:focus {
  color: rgb(150 150 150 / 1);
  background-color: black;
}

.thumb-bar {
  display: flex;
  gap: 2px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.thumb-bar img {
  display: block;
  width: 100px;
  flex: 1;
}

.thumb-bar img:hover,
.thumb-bar img:focus {
  outline: 2px solid blue;
}
```

We've hidden the gallery CSS for brevity, but you can see it when you look at the app in the MDN Playground.

## Project brief

You have been provided with some HTML, CSS, and a few lines of JavaScript code. Your job is to follow the instructions below, writing the necessary JavaScript to turn this into a working image gallery.

The gallery will consist of a large image and a row of thumbnails. When a thumbnail is clicked or tabbed to and <kbd>Enter</kbd>/<kbd>Return</kbd> then pressed, that thumb should then display as the large image. The relevant `<img>` element should also be updated with the correct `alt` text.

In the top-left corner there is a button that, when repeatedly pressed, toggles the large image between a darker and lighter tint, achieved by changing the transparency of a `<div>` element that has been overlaid on top of the large image.

The images you need to embed in the example and their required `alt` text are as follows:

- [`pic1.jpg`](https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/learn/gallery/pic1.jpg): "Closeup of a human eye".
- [`pic2.jpg`](https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/learn/gallery/pic2.jpg): "Rock that looks like a wave".
- [`pic3.jpg`](https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/learn/gallery/pic3.jpg): "Purple and white pansies".
- [`pic4.jpg`](https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/learn/gallery/pic4.jpg): "Section of wall from a pharaoh's tomb".
- [`pic5.jpg`](https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/learn/gallery/pic5.jpg): "Large moth on a leaf".

### Create a data object

First of all, we'd like you to declare an array of objects called `images`. Each object should contain two properties:

- `filename`: The name of the image file (not the full URL).
- `alt`: The image's `alt` text.

### Add the images to the thumbnail bar

Next, we want you to loop through the `images` and use some DOM scripting to embed them all on the page via `<img>` elements. They should be included as children of the `<div>` element with the class of `thumb-bar`, which we've already referenced in the `thumbBar` constant.

1. Create a constant called `baseURL` containing the base URL of each image file (all of the URL not including the filename).
2. Create a `for ... of` loop to loop through the `images`.
3. For each image, create a new `<img>` element.
4. Set the `<img>` source to equal the URL of the image, which should be a combination of the `baseURL` and the `filename`, and the `alt` attribute equal to the `alt` text.
5. Add another attribute to the `<img>` to make it focusable via the keyword.
6. Append the `<img>` to the `thumbBar`.
7. Add a `click` event handler to the `<img>` so that when it is clicked, a function called `updateDisplayedImage()` is run, which displays the clicked image at full size. You'll create this function later on.
8. Add another event handler to the `<img>` so that once it is focused via the keyboard, the clicked image can be displayed at full size by pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd>/<kbd>Return</kbd> key (and no other key). This is a stretch goal that will take a bit of research to figure out.

### Create the `updateDisplayedImage()` function

Now it's time to create the function to display an activated thumbnail at full size. We've stored a reference to the full size `<img>` element in the `displayedImage` constant.

1. Define the `updateDisplayedImage()` function.
2. Inside the function body, set the `displayedImage` source to equal the source of the `<img>` that was activated.
3. Set the `displayedImage` alt text to equal the alt text of the `<img>` that was activated.

### Wire up the Darken/Lighten button

We've stored a reference to the "Darken/Lighten" `<button>` in the `btn` constant, and a reference to the transparent `<div>` we have overlaid on top of the full size `<img>` in the `overlay` constant. We'd like you to:

1. Add a `click` event handler to the `<button>` with an anonymous function set as the handler function.
2. Inside the function body, add a conditional structure that tests whether the `<button>` has a `class` set on it of `dark` or not.
3. If the `<button>` has a `class` of `dark` when clicked, change its text content to `Lighten`, and change the `overlay` element's background color to `rgb(0 0 0 / 0.5)`. Remove the `<button>` element's `dark` class.
4. If the `<button>` _does not_ have a `class` of `dark` when clicked, change its text content to `Darken`, and change the `overlay` element's background color to `rgb(0 0 0 / 0)`. Add the `<button>` element's `dark` class.
5. Can you think of a way to toggle the `dark` class using a single line of code, run after the conditional structure? This is another stretch goal, but give it a go.

## Hints and tips

- You don't need to change the HTML or CSS.

## Example

Your finished app should work like the following live example:

{{EmbedLiveSample("gallery-finish", "100%", 700)}}

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

The finished JavaScript should look something like this:

```js live-sample___gallery-finish
const displayedImage = document.querySelector(".displayed-img");
const thumbBar = document.querySelector(".thumb-bar");

const btn = document.querySelector("button");
const overlay = document.querySelector(".overlay");

// 1. Declare an array of objects containing image file names & alt text

const images = [
  { filename: "pic1.jpg", alt: "Closeup of a human eye" },
  { filename: "pic2.jpg", alt: "Rock that looks like a wave" },
  { filename: "pic3.jpg", alt: "Purple and white pansies" },
  { filename: "pic4.jpg", alt: "Section of wall from a pharaoh's tomb" },
  { filename: "pic5.jpg", alt: "Large moth on a leaf" },
];

// 2. Loop through the images

// 2a. Create a baseURL constant containing the baseURL of the images
const baseURL =
  "https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/learn/gallery/";

// 2b. Loop through the images using a for...of loop
for (const image of images) {
  // 2c. Create a new image element
  const newImage = document.createElement("img");
  // 2d. Set the source and alt text for the image
  newImage.src = `${baseURL}${image.filename}`;
  newImage.alt = image.alt;
  // 2e. Make the image focusable via the keyboard
  newImage.tabIndex = "0";
  // 2f. Append the image as a child of the thumbBar
  thumbBar.appendChild(newImage);
  // 2g. Update the display to show the image full size when a thumb is clicked
  newImage.addEventListener("click", updateDisplayedImage);
  // 2h. Update the display to show the image full size when the "Enter" key
  // is pressed after it has been focused
  newImage.addEventListener("keydown", (e) => {
    if (e.code === "Enter") {
      updateDisplayedImage(e);
    }
  });
}

// 3. Create the updateDisplayedImage() function

function updateDisplayedImage(e) {
  displayedImage.src = e.target.src;
  displayedImage.alt = e.target.alt;
}

// 4. Wire up the Darken/Lighten button

// 4a. Add a click event listener on the button
btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  // 4b. If the button has a "dark" class set,
  // change text to "Lighten" and make the overlay darker
  if (btn.classList.contains("dark")) {
    btn.textContent = "Lighten";
    overlay.style.backgroundColor = "rgb(0 0 0 / 0.5)";
  } else {
    // 4b. Else, change text to "Darken" and make
    // the overlay lighter
    btn.textContent = "Darken";
    overlay.style.backgroundColor = "rgb(0 0 0 / 0)";
  }
  // 4c. Toggle the class ready for the next button press
  btn.classList.toggle("dark");
});
```

# Dynamic scripting with JavaScript

{{NextMenu("Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/What_is_JavaScript", "Learn_web_development/Core")}}

JavaScript is a huge topic, with so many different features, styles, and techniques to learn, and so many APIs and tools built on top of it. This module focuses on the essentials of the core language, plus some key surrounding topics — learning these topics will give you a solid basis to work from.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you don't need any previous JavaScript knowledge, but you should have worked through the previous modules in the course. You should at least know [HTML](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content) and the [basic fundamentals of CSS](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics).

> [!NOTE]
> If you are working on a computer, tablet, or another device where you can't create files, you can try running the code in an online editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/).

## Tutorials and challenges

- [What is JavaScript?](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/What_is_JavaScript)
  - : Welcome to the MDN beginner's JavaScript course! In this first article we will look at JavaScript from a high level, answering questions such as "what is it?", and "what is it doing?", and making sure you are comfortable with JavaScript's purpose.
- [A first splash into JavaScript](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/A_first_splash)
  - : Now you've learned something about the theory of JavaScript, and what you can do with it, we are going to give you a crash course on the basic features of JavaScript via a completely practical tutorial. Here you'll build up a simple "Guess the number" game, step by step.
- [What went wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/What_went_wrong)
  - : When you built up the "Guess the number" game in the previous article, you may have found that it didn't work. Never fear — this article aims to save you from tearing your hair out over such problems by providing you with some simple tips on how to find and fix errors in JavaScript programs.
- [Storing the information you need — Variables](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Variables)
  - : After reading the last couple of articles you should now know what JavaScript is, what it can do for you, how you use it alongside other web technologies, and what its main features look like from a high level. In this article, we will get down to the real basics, looking at how to work with the most basic building blocks of JavaScript — Variables.
- [Basic math in JavaScript — numbers and operators](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Math)
  - : At this point in the course, we discuss maths in JavaScript — how we can combine operators and other features to successfully manipulate numbers to do our bidding.
- [Handling text — strings in JavaScript](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Strings)
  - : Next, we'll turn our attention to strings — this is what pieces of text are called in programming. In this article, we'll look at all the common things that you really ought to know about strings when learning JavaScript, such as creating strings, escaping quotes in strings, and joining them together.
- [Useful string methods](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Useful_string_methods)
  - : Now we've looked at the very basics of strings, let's move up a gear and start thinking about what useful operations we can do on strings with built-in methods, such as finding the length of a text string, joining and splitting strings, substituting one character in a string for another, and more.
- [Arrays](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Arrays)
  - : In this lesson we'll look at arrays — a neat way of storing a list of data items under a single variable name. Here we look at why this is useful, then explore how to create an array, retrieve, add, and remove items stored in an array, and more besides.
- [Challenge: Silly story generator](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Silly_story_generator) <sup>Challenge</sup>
  - : In this challenge you are tasked with taking some of the knowledge you've picked up in this module so far and applying it to creating a fun app that generates random silly stories. Along the way, we'll test your knowledge of variables, math, strings, and arrays.
- [Making decisions in your code — conditionals](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Conditionals)
  - : In any programming language, the code needs to make decisions and carry out actions accordingly depending on different inputs. For example, in a game, if the player's number of lives is 0, then it's game over. In a weather app, if it is being looked at in the morning, show a sunrise graphic; show stars and a moon if it is nighttime. In this article, we'll explore how so-called conditional statements work in JavaScript.
- [Looping code](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Loops)
  - : Programming languages are very useful for rapidly completing repetitive tasks, from multiple basic calculations to just about any other situation where you've got a lot of similar items of work to complete. Here we'll look at the loop structures available in JavaScript that handle such needs.
- [Functions — reusable blocks of code](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Functions)
  - : Another essential concept in coding is **functions**, which allow you to store a piece of code that does a single task inside a defined block, and then call that code whenever you need it using a single short command — rather than having to type out the same code multiple times. In this article we'll explore fundamental concepts behind functions such as basic syntax, how to invoke and define them, scope, and parameters.
- [Build your own function](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Build_your_own_function)
  - : With most of the essential theory dealt with in the previous article, this article provides practical experience. Here you will get some practice building your own, custom function. Along the way, we'll also explain some useful details of dealing with functions.
- [Function return values](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Return_values)
  - : There's one last essential concept about functions for us to discuss — return values. Some functions don't return a significant value, but others do. It's important to understand what their values are, how to use them in your code, and how to make functions return useful values. We'll cover all of these below.
- [Introduction to events](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Events)
  - : In this article, we discuss some important concepts surrounding events, and look at the fundamentals of how they work in browsers.
- [Event bubbling](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Event_bubbling)
  - : This article introduces the concepts of event bubbling, event capture, and event delegation, which are all about what happens when you add a listener to an element that contains another element, and an event then happens to the contained element.
- [Challenge: Image gallery](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Image_gallery) <sup>Challenge</sup>
  - : Now that we've looked at the fundamental building blocks of JavaScript, we'll test your knowledge of loops, functions, conditionals and events by getting you to build a fairly common item you'll see on a lot of websites — a JavaScript-powered image gallery.
- [Object basics](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Object_basics)
  - : In this article, we'll look at fundamental JavaScript object syntax, and revisit some JavaScript features that we've already seen earlier in the course, reiterating the fact that many of the features you've already dealt with are objects.
- [DOM scripting introduction](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/DOM_scripting)
  - : When writing web pages and apps, one of the most common things you'll want to do is change the document structure in some way. This is usually done by manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) via a set of built-in browser APIs for controlling HTML and styling information. In this article we'll introduce you to **DOM scripting**.
- [Making network requests with JavaScript](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Network_requests)
  - : Another very common task in modern websites and applications is making network requests to retrieve individual data items from the server to update sections of a webpage without having to load an entire new page. This seemingly small detail has had a huge impact on the performance and behavior of sites, so in this article, we'll explain the concept and look at technologies that make it possible.
- [Working with JSON](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/JSON)
  - : JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa). You'll come across it quite often, so in this article, we give you all you need to work with JSON using JavaScript, including parsing JSON so you can access data within it, and creating JSON.
- [Challenge: Building a house data UI](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/House_data_UI) <sup>Challenge</sup>
  - : In this challenge we are going to get you to write some JavaScript for a house search page on a property website. This will include fetching JSON data, filtering that data based on the values entered in provided form controls, and rendering that data to the UI. Along the way, we'll also test your knowledge of conditionals, loops, arrays and array methods, and more besides.
- [JavaScript debugging and error handling](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Debugging_JavaScript)
  - : In this lesson, we will return to the subject of debugging JavaScript (which we first looked at in [What went wrong?](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/What_went_wrong)). Here we will delve deeper into techniques for tracking down errors, but also look at how to code defensively and handle errors in your code, avoiding problems in the first place.

## Test your skills

You will find "Test your skills" articles placed between the tutorial articles to check whether you have retained the most important information before you move on. If you want to explore all of these together, you can find them listed at [Test your skills: JavaScript](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Test_your_skills).

# Working with JSON

{{PreviousMenuNext("Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Network_requests","Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Test_your_skills/JSON", "Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting")}}

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa). You'll come across it quite often, so in this article, we give you all you need to work with JSON using JavaScript, including parsing JSON so you can access data within it, and creating JSON.

## No, really, what is JSON?

{{glossary("JSON")}} is a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax.
It represents structured data as a string, which is useful when you want to transmit data across a network.
Even though it closely resembles JavaScript object literal syntax, it can be used independently from JavaScript. Many programming environments feature the ability to read (parse) and generate JSON.
In JavaScript, the methods for parsing and generating JSON are provided by the [`JSON`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON) object.

> [!NOTE]
> Converting a string to a native object is called _deserialization_, while converting a native object to a string so it can be transmitted across the network is called _serialization_.

A JSON string can be stored in its own file, which is basically just a text file with an extension of `.json`, and a {{glossary("MIME type")}} of `application/json`.

### JSON structure

As described above, JSON is a string whose format very much resembles JavaScript object literal format.
The following is a valid JSON string representing an object.
Note that it is also a valid JavaScript object literal — just with some more [syntax restrictions](#json_syntax_restrictions).

```json
{
  "squadName": "Super hero squad",
  "homeTown": "Metro City",
  "formed": 2016,
  "secretBase": "Super tower",
  "active": true,
  "members": [
    {
      "name": "Molecule Man",
      "age": 29,
      "secretIdentity": "Dan Jukes",
      "powers": ["Radiation resistance", "Turning tiny", "Radiation blast"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Madame Uppercut",
      "age": 39,
      "secretIdentity": "Jane Wilson",
      "powers": [
        "Million tonne punch",
        "Damage resistance",
        "Superhuman reflexes"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Eternal Flame",
      "age": 1000000,
      "secretIdentity": "Unknown",
      "powers": [
        "Immortality",
        "Heat Immunity",
        "Inferno",
        "Teleportation",
        "Interdimensional travel"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

If you load this JSON in your JavaScript program as a string, you can parse it into a normal object and then access the data inside it using the same dot/bracket notation we looked at in the [JavaScript object basics](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Object_basics) article.
For example:

```js
superHeroes.homeTown;
superHeroes.members[1].powers[2];
```

1. First, we have the variable name — `superHeroes`.
2. Inside that, we want to access the `members` property, so we use `.members`.
3. `members` contains an array populated by objects. We want to access the second object inside the array, so we use `[1]`.
4. Inside this object, we want to access the `powers` property, so we use `.powers`.
5. Inside the `powers` property is an array containing the selected hero's superpowers. We want the third one, so we use `[2]`.

The key takeaway is that there's really nothing special about working with JSON; after you've parsed it into a JavaScript object, you work with it just like you would with an object declared using the same object literal syntax.

> [!NOTE]
> We've made the JSON seen above available inside a variable in our [JSONTest.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/json/JSONTest.html) example (see the [source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/oojs/json/JSONTest.html)).
> Try loading this up and then accessing data inside the variable via your browser's JavaScript console.

### Arrays as JSON

Above we mentioned that JSON text basically looks like a JavaScript object inside a string.
We can also convert arrays to/from JSON. The below example is perfectly valid JSON:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Molecule Man",
    "age": 29,
    "secretIdentity": "Dan Jukes",
    "powers": ["Radiation resistance", "Turning tiny", "Radiation blast"]
  },
  {
    "name": "Madame Uppercut",
    "age": 39,
    "secretIdentity": "Jane Wilson",
    "powers": [
      "Million tonne punch",
      "Damage resistance",
      "Superhuman reflexes"
    ]
  }
]
```

You have to access array items (in its parsed version) by starting with an array index, for example `superHeroes[0].powers[0]`.

The JSON can also contain a single primitive. For example, `29`, `"Dan Jukes"`, or `true` are all valid JSON.

### JSON syntax restrictions

As mentioned earlier, any JSON is a valid JavaScript literal (object, array, number, etc.). The converse is not true, though—not all JavaScript object literals are valid JSON.

- JSON can only contain _serializable_ data types. This means:
  - For primitives, JSON can contain string literals, number literals, `true`, `false`, and `null`. Notably, it cannot contain `undefined`, `NaN`, or `Infinity`.
  - For non-primitives, JSON can contain object literals and arrays, but not functions or any other object types, such as `Date`, `Set`, and `Map`. The objects and arrays inside JSON need to further contain valid JSON data types.
- Strings must be enclosed in double quotes, not single quotes.
- Numbers must be written in decimal notation.
- Each property of an object must be in the form of `"key": value`. Property names must be string literals enclosed in double quotes. Special JavaScript syntax, such as methods, is not allowed because methods are functions, and functions are not valid JSON data types.
- Objects and arrays cannot contain [trailing commas](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Trailing_commas).
- Comments are not allowed in JSON.

Even a single misplaced comma or colon can make a JSON file invalid and cause it to fail.
You should be careful to validate any data you are attempting to use (although computer-generated JSON is less likely to include errors, as long as the generator program is working correctly).
You can validate JSON using an application like [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/) or [JSON-validate](https://www.json-validate.com/)

> [!NOTE]
> Now you've read through this section, you might also want to supplement your learning with Scrimba's [JSON review](https://scrimba.com/frontend-path-c0j/~0lt?via=mdn) <sup>[_MDN learning partner_](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Learning_content#partner_links_and_embeds)</sup> interactive tutorial, which provides some useful guidance around basic JSON syntax and how to view JSON request data inside your browser's devtools.

## Working through a JSON example

So, let's work through an example to show how we could make use of some JSON formatted data on a website.

### Getting started

To begin with, make local copies of our [heroes.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/oojs/json/heroes.html) and [style.css](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/oojs/json/style.css) files.
The latter contains some simple CSS to style our page, while the former contains some very simple body HTML, plus a {{HTMLElement("script")}} element to contain the JavaScript code we will be writing in this exercise:

```html-nolint
<header>
...
</header>

<section>
...
</section>

<script>
// JavaScript goes here
</script>
```

We have made our JSON data available on our GitHub, at <https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/json/superheroes.json>.

We are going to load the JSON into our script, and use some nifty DOM manipulation to display it, like this:

![Image of a document titled "Super hero squad" (in a fancy font) and subtitled "Hometown: Metro City // Formed: 2016". Three columns below the heading are titled "Molecule Man", "Madame Uppercut", and "Eternal Flame", respectively. Each column lists the hero's secret identity name, age, and superpowers.](json-superheroes.png)

### Top-level function

The top-level function looks like this:

```js
async function populate() {
  const requestURL =
    "https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/json/superheroes.json";
  const request = new Request(requestURL);

  const response = await fetch(request);
  const superHeroes = await response.json();

  populateHeader(superHeroes);
  populateHeroes(superHeroes);
}
```

To obtain the JSON, we use an API called [Fetch](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).
This API allows us to make network requests to retrieve resources from a server via JavaScript (e.g., images, text, JSON, even HTML snippets), meaning that we can update small sections of content without having to reload the entire page.

In our function, the first four lines use the Fetch API to fetch the JSON from the server:

- we declare the `requestURL` variable to store the GitHub URL
- we use the URL to initialize a new {{domxref("Request")}} object.
- we make the network request using the {{domxref("Window/fetch", "fetch()")}} function, and this returns a {{domxref("Response")}} object
- we retrieve the response as JSON using the {{domxref("Response/json", "json()")}} function of the `Response` object.

> [!NOTE]
> The `fetch()` API is **asynchronous**. You can learn about asynchronous functions in detail in our [Asynchronous JavaScript module](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Async_JS), but for now, we'll just say that we need to add the keyword {{jsxref("Statements/async_function", "async")}} before the name of the function that uses the fetch API, and add the keyword {{jsxref("Operators/await", "await")}} before the calls to any asynchronous functions.

After all that, the `superHeroes` variable will contain the JavaScript object based on the JSON. We are then passing that object to two function calls — the first one fills the `<header>` with the correct data, while the second one creates an information card for each hero on the team, and inserts it into the `<section>`.

### Populating the header

Now that we've retrieved the JSON data and converted it into a JavaScript object, let's make use of it by writing the two functions we referenced above. First of all, add the following function definition below the previous code:

```js
function populateHeader(obj) {
  const header = document.querySelector("header");
  const myH1 = document.createElement("h1");
  myH1.textContent = obj.squadName;
  header.appendChild(myH1);

  const myPara = document.createElement("p");
  myPara.textContent = `Hometown: ${obj.homeTown} // Formed: ${obj.formed}`;
  header.appendChild(myPara);
}
```

Here we first create an {{HTMLElement("Heading_Elements", "h1")}} element with [`createElement()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement), set its [`textContent`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent) to equal the `squadName` property of the object, then append it to the header using [`appendChild()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild). We then do a very similar operation with a paragraph: create it, set its text content and append it to the header. The only difference is that its text is set to a [template literal](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) containing both the `homeTown` and `formed` properties of the object.

### Creating the hero information cards

Next, add the following function at the bottom of the code, which creates and displays the superhero cards:

```js
function populateHeroes(obj) {
  const section = document.querySelector("section");
  const heroes = obj.members;

  for (const hero of heroes) {
    const myArticle = document.createElement("article");
    const myH2 = document.createElement("h2");
    const myPara1 = document.createElement("p");
    const myPara2 = document.createElement("p");
    const myPara3 = document.createElement("p");
    const myList = document.createElement("ul");

    myH2.textContent = hero.name;
    myPara1.textContent = `Secret identity: ${hero.secretIdentity}`;
    myPara2.textContent = `Age: ${hero.age}`;
    myPara3.textContent = "Superpowers:";

    const superPowers = hero.powers;
    for (const power of superPowers) {
      const listItem = document.createElement("li");
      listItem.textContent = power;
      myList.appendChild(listItem);
    }

    myArticle.appendChild(myH2);
    myArticle.appendChild(myPara1);
    myArticle.appendChild(myPara2);
    myArticle.appendChild(myPara3);
    myArticle.appendChild(myList);

    section.appendChild(myArticle);
  }
}
```

To start with, we store the `members` property of the JavaScript object in a new variable. This array contains multiple objects that contain the information for each hero.

Next, we use a [`for...of` loop](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Loops#the_for...of_loop) to iterate through each object in the array. For each one, we:

1. Create several new elements: an `<article>`, an `<h2>`, three `<p>`s, and a `<ul>`.
2. Set the `<h2>` to contain the current hero's `name`.
3. Fill the three paragraphs with their `secretIdentity`, `age`, and a line saying "Superpowers:" to introduce the information in the list.
4. Store the `powers` property in another new constant called `superPowers` — this contains an array that lists the current hero's superpowers.
5. Use another `for...of` loop to loop through the current hero's superpowers — for each one we create an `<li>` element, put the superpower inside it, then put the `listItem` inside the `<ul>` element (`myList`) using `appendChild()`.
6. The very last thing we do is to append the `<h2>`, `<p>`s, and `<ul>` inside the `<article>` (`myArticle`), then append the `<article>` inside the `<section>`. The order in which things are appended is important, as this is the order they will be displayed inside the HTML.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are having trouble getting the example to work, try referring to our [heroes-finished.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/oojs/json/heroes-finished.html) source code (see it [running live](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/json/heroes-finished.html) also.)

> [!NOTE]
> If you are having trouble following the dot/bracket notation we are using to access the JavaScript object, it can help to have the [superheroes.json](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/json/superheroes.json) file open in another tab or your text editor, and refer to it as you look at our JavaScript.
> You should also refer back to our [JavaScript object basics](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Object_basics) article for more information on dot and bracket notation.

### Calling the top-level function

Finally, we need to call our top-level `populate()` function:

```js
populate();
```

## Converting between objects and text

The above example was simple in terms of accessing the JavaScript object, because we converted the network response directly into a JavaScript object using `response.json()`.

But sometimes we aren't so lucky — sometimes we receive a raw JSON string, and we need to convert it to an object ourselves. And when we want to send a JavaScript object across the network, we need to convert it to JSON (a string) before sending it. Luckily, these two problems are so common in web development that a built-in [JSON](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON) object is available in browsers, which contains the following two methods:

- [`parse()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse): Accepts a JSON string as a parameter, and returns the corresponding JavaScript object.
- [`stringify()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify): Accepts an object as a parameter, and returns the equivalent JSON string.

You can see the first one in action in our [heroes-finished-json-parse.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/json/heroes-finished-json-parse.html) example (see the [source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/oojs/json/heroes-finished-json-parse.html)) — this does exactly the same thing as the example we built up earlier, except that:

- we retrieve the response as text rather than JSON, by calling the {{domxref("Response/text", "text()")}} method of the response
- we then use `parse()` to convert the text to a JavaScript object.

The key snippet of code is here:

```js
async function populate() {
  const requestURL =
    "https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/json/superheroes.json";
  const request = new Request(requestURL);

  const response = await fetch(request);
  const superHeroesText = await response.text();

  const superHeroes = JSON.parse(superHeroesText);
  populateHeader(superHeroes);
  populateHeroes(superHeroes);
}
```

As you might guess, `stringify()` works the opposite way. Try entering the following lines into your browser's JavaScript console one by one to see it in action:

```js
let myObj = { name: "Chris", age: 38 };
myObj;
let myString = JSON.stringify(myObj);
myString;
```

Here we're creating a JavaScript object, checking what it contains, converting it to a JSON string using `stringify()` — saving the return value in a new variable — then checking it again.

## Summary

In this lesson, we've introduced you to using JSON in your programs, including how to create and parse JSON, and how to access data locked inside it. In the next article, we'll give you some tests that you can use to check how well you've understood and retained all this information.

Programming languages are very useful for rapidly completing repetitive tasks, from multiple basic calculations to just about any other situation where you've got a lot of similar items of work to complete. Here we'll look at the loop structures available in JavaScript that handle such needs.

## Why are loops useful?

Loops are all about doing the same thing over and over again. Often, the code will be slightly different each time round the loop, or the same code will run but with different variables.

### Looping code example

Suppose we wanted to draw 100 random circles on a {{htmlelement("canvas")}} element (press the _Update_ button to run the example again and again to see different random sets):

```html hidden
<button>Update</button> <canvas></canvas>
```

```css hidden
html {
  width: 100%;
  height: inherit;
  background: #dddddd;
}

canvas {
  display: block;
}

body {
  margin: 0;
}

button {
  position: absolute;
  top: 5px;
  left: 5px;
}
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Looping_code_example', '100%', 400) }}

Here's the JavaScript code that implements this example:

```js
const btn = document.querySelector("button");
const canvas = document.querySelector("canvas");
const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

canvas.width = document.documentElement.clientWidth;
canvas.height = document.documentElement.clientHeight;

function random(number) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * number);
}

function draw() {
  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.fillStyle = "rgb(255 0 0 / 50%)";
    ctx.arc(
      random(canvas.width),
      random(canvas.height),
      random(50),
      0,
      2 * Math.PI,
    );
    ctx.fill();
  }
}

btn.addEventListener("click", draw);
```

### With and without a loop

You don't have to understand all the code for now, but let's look at the part of the code that actually draws the 100 circles:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.fillStyle = "rgb(255 0 0 / 50%)";
  ctx.arc(
    random(canvas.width),
    random(canvas.height),
    random(50),
    0,
    2 * Math.PI,
  );
  ctx.fill();
}
```

You should get the basic idea — we are using a loop to run 100 iterations of this code, each one of which draws a circle in a random position on the page. `random(x)`, defined earlier in the code, returns a whole number between `0` and `x-1`.
The amount of code needed would be the same whether we were drawing 100 circles, 1000, or 10,000.
Only one number has to change.

If we weren't using a loop here, we'd have to repeat the following code for every circle we wanted to draw:

```js
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.fillStyle = "rgb(255 0 0 / 50%)";
ctx.arc(
  random(canvas.width),
  random(canvas.height),
  random(50),
  0,
  2 * Math.PI,
);
ctx.fill();
```

This would get very boring and difficult to maintain.

## Looping through a collection

Most of the time when you use a loop, you will have a collection of items and want to do something with every item.

One type of collection is the {{jsxref("Array")}}, which we met in the [Arrays](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Arrays) chapter of this course.
But there are other collections in JavaScript as well, including {{jsxref("Set")}} and {{jsxref("Map")}}.

### The for...of loop

The basic tool for looping through a collection is the {{jsxref("statements/for...of","for...of")}} loop:

```js
const cats = ["Leopard", "Serval", "Jaguar", "Tiger", "Caracal", "Lion"];

for (const cat of cats) {
  console.log(cat);
}
```

In this example, `for (const cat of cats)` says:

1. Given the collection `cats`, get the first item in the collection.
2. Assign it to the variable `cat` and then run the code between the curly braces `{}`.
3. Get the next item, and repeat (2) until you've reached the end of the collection.

### map() and filter()

JavaScript also has more specialized loops for collections, and we'll mention two of them here.

You can use `map()` to do something to each item in a collection and create a new collection containing the changed items:

```js
function toUpper(string) {
  return string.toUpperCase();
}

const cats = ["Leopard", "Serval", "Jaguar", "Tiger", "Caracal", "Lion"];

const upperCats = cats.map(toUpper);

console.log(upperCats);
// [ "LEOPARD", "SERVAL", "JAGUAR", "TIGER", "CARACAL", "LION" ]
```

Here we pass a function into {{jsxref("Array.prototype.map()","cats.map()")}}, and `map()` calls the function once for each item in the array, passing in the item. It then adds the return value from each function call to a new array, and finally returns the new array. In this case the function we provide converts the item to uppercase, so the resulting array contains all our cats in uppercase:

```js-nolint
[ "LEOPARD", "SERVAL", "JAGUAR", "TIGER", "CARACAL", "LION" ]
```

You can use {{jsxref("Array.prototype.filter()","filter()")}} to test each item in a collection, and create a new collection containing only items that match:

```js
function lCat(cat) {
  return cat.startsWith("L");
}

const cats = ["Leopard", "Serval", "Jaguar", "Tiger", "Caracal", "Lion"];

const filtered = cats.filter(lCat);

console.log(filtered);
// [ "Leopard", "Lion" ]
```

This looks a lot like `map()`, except the function we pass in returns a [boolean](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Variables#booleans): if it returns `true`, then the item is included in the new array.
Our function tests that the item starts with the letter "L", so the result is an array containing only cats whose names start with "L":

```js-nolint
[ "Leopard", "Lion" ]
```

Note that `map()` and `filter()` are both often used with _function expressions_, which you will learn about in our [Functions](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Functions) lesson.
Using function expressions we could rewrite the example above to be much more compact:

```js
const cats = ["Leopard", "Serval", "Jaguar", "Tiger", "Caracal", "Lion"];

const filtered = cats.filter((cat) => cat.startsWith("L"));
console.log(filtered);
// [ "Leopard", "Lion" ]
```

## The standard for loop

In the "drawing circles" example above, you don't have a collection of items to loop through: you really just want to run the same code 100 times.
In a case like that, you can use the {{jsxref("statements/for","for")}} loop.
This has the following syntax:

```js-nolint
for (initializer; condition; final-expression) {
  // code to run
}
```

Here we have:

1. The keyword `for`, followed by some parentheses.
2. Inside the parentheses we have three items, separated by semicolons:
   1. An **initializer** — this is usually a variable set to a number, which is incremented to count the number of times the loop has run.
      It is also sometimes referred to as a **counter variable**.
   2. A **condition** — this defines when the loop should stop looping.
      This is generally an expression featuring a comparison operator, a test to see if the exit condition has been met.
   3. A **final-expression** — this is always evaluated (or run) each time the loop has gone through a full iteration.
      It usually serves to increment (or in some cases decrement) the counter variable, to bring it closer to the point where the condition is no longer `true`.

3. Some curly braces that contain a block of code — this code will be run each time the loop iterates.

### Calculating squares

Let's look at a real example so we can visualize what these do more clearly.

```html hidden
<button id="calculate">Calculate</button>
<button id="clear">Clear</button>
<pre id="results"></pre>
```

```js
const results = document.querySelector("#results");

function calculate() {
  for (let i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    const newResult = `${i} x ${i} = ${i * i}`;
    results.textContent += `${newResult}\n`;
  }
  results.textContent += "\nFinished!\n\n";
}

const calculateBtn = document.querySelector("#calculate");
const clearBtn = document.querySelector("#clear");

calculateBtn.addEventListener("click", calculate);
clearBtn.addEventListener("click", () => (results.textContent = ""));
```

This gives us the following output:

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Calculating squares', '100%', 250) }}

This code calculates squares for the numbers from 1 to 9, and writes out the result. The core of the code is the `for` loop that performs the calculation.

Let's break down the `for (let i = 1; i < 10; i++)` line into its three pieces:

1. `let i = 1`: the counter variable, `i`, starts at `1`. Note that we have to use `let` for the counter, because we're reassigning it each time we go round the loop.
2. `i < 10`: keep going round the loop for as long as `i` is smaller than `10`.
3. `i++`: add one to `i` each time round the loop.

Inside the loop, we calculate the square of the current value of `i`, that is: `i * i`. We create a string expressing the calculation we made and the result, and add this string to the output text. We also add `\n`, so the next string we add will begin on a new line. So:

1. During the first run, `i = 1`, so we will add `1 x 1 = 1`.
2. During the second run, `i = 2`, so we will add `2 x 2 = 4`.
3. And so on…
4. When `i` becomes equal to `10` we will stop running the loop and move straight to the next bit of code below the loop, printing out the `Finished!` message on a new line.

### Looping through collections with a for loop

You can use a `for` loop to iterate through a collection, instead of a `for...of` loop.

Let's look again at our `for...of` example above:

```js
const cats = ["Leopard", "Serval", "Jaguar", "Tiger", "Caracal", "Lion"];

for (const cat of cats) {
  console.log(cat);
}
```

We could rewrite that code like this:

```js
const cats = ["Leopard", "Serval", "Jaguar", "Tiger", "Caracal", "Lion"];

for (let i = 0; i < cats.length; i++) {
  console.log(cats[i]);
}
```

In this loop we're starting `i` at `0`, and stopping when `i` reaches the length of the array.
Then inside the loop, we're using `i` to access each item in the array in turn.

This works just fine, and in early versions of JavaScript, `for...of` didn't exist, so this was the standard way to iterate through an array.
However, it offers more chances to introduce bugs into your code. For example:

- you might start `i` at `1`, forgetting that the first array index is zero, not 1.
- you might stop at `i <= cats.length`, forgetting that the last array index is at `length - 1`.

For reasons like this, it's usually best to use `for...of` if you can.

Sometimes you still need to use a `for` loop to iterate through an array.
For example, in the code below we want to log a message listing our cats:

```js
const cats = ["Pete", "Biggles", "Jasmine"];

let myFavoriteCats = "My cats are called ";

for (const cat of cats) {
  myFavoriteCats += `${cat}, `;
}

console.log(myFavoriteCats); // "My cats are called Pete, Biggles, Jasmine, "
```

The final output sentence isn't very well-formed:

```plain
My cats are called Pete, Biggles, Jasmine,
```

We'd prefer it to handle the last cat differently, like this:

```plain
My cats are called Pete, Biggles, and Jasmine.
```

But to do this we need to know when we are on the final loop iteration, and to do that we can use a `for` loop and examine the value of `i`:

```js
const cats = ["Pete", "Biggles", "Jasmine"];

let myFavoriteCats = "My cats are called ";

for (let i = 0; i < cats.length; i++) {
  if (i === cats.length - 1) {
    // We are at the end of the array
    myFavoriteCats += `and ${cats[i]}.`;
  } else {
    myFavoriteCats += `${cats[i]}, `;
  }
}

console.log(myFavoriteCats); // "My cats are called Pete, Biggles, and Jasmine."
```

## Exiting loops with break

If you want to exit a loop before all the iterations have been completed, you can use the [break](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/break) statement.
We already met this in the previous article when we looked at [switch statements](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Conditionals#switch_statements) — when a case is met in a switch statement that matches the input expression, the `break` statement immediately exits the switch statement and moves on to the code after it.

It's the same with loops — a `break` statement will immediately exit the loop and make the browser move on to any code that follows it.

Say we wanted to search through an array of contacts and telephone numbers and return just the number we wanted to find?
First, some simple HTML — a text {{htmlelement("input")}} allowing us to enter a name to search for, a {{htmlelement("button")}} element to submit a search, and a {{htmlelement("p")}} element to display the results in:

```html
<label for="search">Search by contact name: </label>
<input id="search" type="text" />
<button>Search</button>

<p></p>
```

Now on to the JavaScript:

```js
const contacts = [
  "Chris:2232322",
  "Sarah:3453456",
  "Bill:7654322",
  "Mary:9998769",
  "Dianne:9384975",
];
const para = document.querySelector("p");
const input = document.querySelector("input");
const btn = document.querySelector("button");

btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  const searchName = input.value.toLowerCase();
  input.value = "";
  input.focus();
  para.textContent = "";
  for (const contact of contacts) {
    const splitContact = contact.split(":");
    if (splitContact[0].toLowerCase() === searchName) {
      para.textContent = `${splitContact[0]}'s number is ${splitContact[1]}.`;
      break;
    }
  }
  if (para.textContent === "") {
    para.textContent = "Contact not found.";
  }
});
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Exiting_loops_with_break', '100%', 100) }}

1. First of all, we have some variable definitions — we have an array of contact information, with each item being a string containing a name and phone number separated by a colon.
2. Next, we attach an event listener to the button (`btn`) so that when it is pressed some code is run to perform the search and return the results.
3. We store the value entered into the text input in a variable called `searchName`, before then emptying the text input and focusing it again, ready for the next search.
   Note that we also run the [`toLowerCase()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toLowerCase) method on the string, so that searches will be case-insensitive.
4. Now on to the interesting part, the `for...of` loop:
   1. Inside the loop, we first split the current contact at the colon character, and store the resulting two values in an array called `splitContact`.
   2. We then use a conditional statement to test whether `splitContact[0]` (the contact's name, again lower-cased with [`toLowerCase()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toLowerCase)) is equal to the inputted `searchName`.
      If it is, we enter a string into the paragraph to report what the contact's number is, and use `break` to end the loop.

5. After the loop, we check whether we set a contact, and if not we set the paragraph text to "Contact not found.".

## Skipping iterations with continue

The [continue](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/continue) statement works similarly to `break`, but instead of breaking out of the loop entirely, it skips to the next iteration of the loop.
Let's look at another example that takes a number as an input, and returns only the numbers that are squares of integers (whole numbers).

The HTML is basically the same as the last example — a simple numeric input, and a paragraph for output.

```html
<label for="number">Enter number: </label>
<input id="number" type="number" />
<button>Generate integer squares</button>

<p>Output:</p>
```

The JavaScript is mostly the same too, although the loop itself is a bit different:

```js
const para = document.querySelector("p");
const input = document.querySelector("input");
const btn = document.querySelector("button");

btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  para.textContent = "Output: ";
  const num = input.value;
  input.value = "";
  input.focus();
  for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
    let sqRoot = Math.sqrt(i);
    if (Math.floor(sqRoot) !== sqRoot) {
      continue;
    }
    para.textContent += `${i} `;
  }
});
```

Here's the output:

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Skipping_iterations_with_continue', '100%', 100) }}

1. In this case, the input should be a number (`num`). The `for` loop is given a counter starting at 1 (as we are not interested in 0 in this case), an exit condition that says the loop will stop when the counter becomes bigger than the input `num`, and an iterator that adds 1 to the counter each time.
2. Inside the loop, we find the square root of each number using [`Math.sqrt(i)`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/sqrt), then check whether the square root is an integer by testing whether it is the same as itself when it has been rounded down to the nearest integer (this is what [`Math.floor()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/floor) does to the number it is passed).
3. If the square root and the rounded down square root do not equal one another (`!==`), it means that the square root is not an integer, so we are not interested in it. In such a case, we use the `continue` statement to skip on to the next loop iteration without recording the number anywhere.
4. If the square root is an integer, we skip past the `if` block entirely, so the `continue` statement is not executed; instead, we concatenate the current `i` value plus a space at the end of the paragraph content.

## while and do...while

`for` is not the only type of general loop available in JavaScript. There are actually many others and, while you don't need to understand all of these now, it is worth having a look at the structure of a couple of others so that you can recognize the same features at work in a slightly different way.

First, let's have a look at the [`while`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while) loop. This loop's syntax looks like so:

```js-nolint
initializer
while (condition) {
  // code to run

  final-expression
}
```

This works in a very similar way to the `for` loop, except that the initializer variable is set before the loop, and the final-expression is included inside the loop after the code to run, rather than these two items being included inside the parentheses.
The condition is included inside the parentheses, which are preceded by the `while` keyword rather than `for`.

The same three items are still present, and they are still defined in the same order as they are in the for loop.
This is because you must have an initializer defined before you can check whether or not the condition is true.
The final-expression is then run after the code inside the loop has run (an iteration has been completed), which will only happen if the condition is still true.

Let's have a look again at our cats list example, but rewritten to use a while loop:

```js
const cats = ["Pete", "Biggles", "Jasmine"];

let myFavoriteCats = "My cats are called ";

let i = 0;

while (i < cats.length) {
  if (i === cats.length - 1) {
    myFavoriteCats += `and ${cats[i]}.`;
  } else {
    myFavoriteCats += `${cats[i]}, `;
  }

  i++;
}

console.log(myFavoriteCats); // "My cats are called Pete, Biggles, and Jasmine."
```

> [!NOTE]
> This still works just the same as expected — have a look at it [running live on GitHub](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/building-blocks/loops/while.html) (also view the [full source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/building-blocks/loops/while.html)).

The [`do...while`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/do...while) loop is very similar, but provides a variation on the while structure:

```js-nolint
initializer
do {
  // code to run

  final-expression
} while (condition)
```

In this case, the initializer again comes first, before the loop starts. The keyword directly precedes the curly braces containing the code to run and the final expression.

The main difference between a `do...while` loop and a `while` loop is that _the code inside a `do...while` loop is always executed at least once_. That's because the condition comes after the code inside the loop. So we always run that code, then check to see if we need to run it again. In `while` and `for` loops, the check comes first, so the code might never be executed.

Let's rewrite our cat listing example again to use a `do...while` loop:

```js
const cats = ["Pete", "Biggles", "Jasmine"];

let myFavoriteCats = "My cats are called ";

let i = 0;

do {
  if (i === cats.length - 1) {
    myFavoriteCats += `and ${cats[i]}.`;
  } else {
    myFavoriteCats += `${cats[i]}, `;
  }

  i++;
} while (i < cats.length);

console.log(myFavoriteCats); // "My cats are called Pete, Biggles, and Jasmine."
```

> [!NOTE]
> Again, this works just the same as expected — have a look at it [running live on GitHub](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/building-blocks/loops/do-while.html) (also view the [full source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/building-blocks/loops/do-while.html)).

> [!WARNING]
> With any kind of loop, you must make sure that the initializer is incremented or, depending on the case, decremented, so the condition eventually becomes false.
> If not, the loop will go on forever, and either the browser will force it to stop, or it will crash. This is called an **infinite loop**.

## Implementing a launch countdown

In this exercise, we want you to print out a simple launch countdown to the output box, from 10 down to Blastoff.

To complete the exercise:

1. Click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.
2. Add code to loop from 10 down to 0. We've provided you with an initializer — `let i = 10;`.
3. For each iteration, create a new paragraph and append it to the output `<div>`, which we've selected using `const output = document.querySelector('.output');`. We've provided you with three code lines inside comment that need to be used somewhere inside the loop:
   1. `const para = document.createElement('p');` — creates a new paragraph.
   2. `output.appendChild(para);` — appends the paragraph to the output `<div>`.
   3. `para.textContent =` — makes the text inside the paragraph equal to whatever you put on the right-hand side, after the equals sign.
4. For the different iteration numbers listed below, write code to insert the required text inside the paragraph (you'll need a conditional statement and multiple `para.textContent =` lines):
   1. If the number is 10, print "Countdown 10" to the paragraph.
   2. If the number is 0, print "Blast off!" to the paragraph.
   3. For any other number, print just the number to the paragraph.
5. Remember to include an iterator! However, in this example we are counting down after each iteration, not up, so you **don't** want `i++` — how do you iterate downwards?

> [!NOTE]
> If you start typing the loop (for example `(while(i>=0)`), the browser might get stuck in an infinite loop because you have not yet entered the end condition. So be careful with this. You can start writing your code in a comment to deal with this issue and remove the comment after you finish.

## Filling in a guest list

In this exercise, we want you to take a list of names stored in an array and put them into a guest list. But it's not quite that easy — we don't want to let Phil and Lola in because they are greedy and rude, and always eat all the food! We have two lists, one for guests to admit, and one for guests to refuse.

To complete the exercise:

1. Click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.
2. Write a loop that will iterate through the `people` array.
3. During each loop iteration, check if the current array item is equal to "Phil" or "Lola" using a conditional statement:
   1. If it is, concatenate the array item to the end of the `refused` paragraph's `textContent`, followed by a comma and a space.
   2. If it isn't, concatenate the array item to the end of the `admitted` paragraph's `textContent`, followed by a comma and a space.

We've already provided you with:

- `refused.textContent +=` — the beginnings of a line that will concatenate something to the end of `refused.textContent`.
- `admitted.textContent +=` — the beginnings of a line that will concatenate something to the end of `admitted.textContent`.

Extra bonus question — after completing the above tasks successfully, you will be left with two lists of names, separated by commas, but they will be untidy — there will be a comma at the end of each one. Can you work out how to write lines that slice the last comma off in each case, and add a full stop to the end?

## Which loop type should you use?

If you're iterating through an array or some other object that supports it, and don't need access to the index position of each item, then `for...of` is the best choice. It's easier to read and there's less to go wrong.

For other uses, `for`, `while`, and `do...while` loops are largely interchangeable.
They can all be used to solve the same problems, and which one you use will largely depend on your personal preference — which one you find easiest to remember or most intuitive.
We would recommend `for`, at least to begin with, as it is probably the easiest for remembering everything — the initializer, condition, and final-expression all have to go neatly into the parentheses, so it is easy to see where they are and check that you aren't missing them.

Let's have a look at them all again.

First `for...of`:

```js-nolint
for (const item of array) {
  // code to run
}
```

`for`:

```js-nolint
for (initializer; condition; final-expression) {
  // code to run
}
```

`while`:

```js-nolint
initializer
while (condition) {
  // code to run

  final-expression
}
```

and finally `do...while`:

```js-nolint
initializer
do {
  // code to run

  final-expression
} while (condition)
```

## Summary

This article has revealed to you the basic concepts behind, and different options available when looping code in JavaScript.
You should now be clear on why loops are a good mechanism for dealing with repetitive code and raring to use them in your own examples!

## Everybody loves math

Okay, maybe not. Some of us like math, some of us have hated math ever since we had to learn multiplication tables and long division in school, and some of us sit somewhere in between the two. But none of us can deny that math is a fundamental part of life that we can't get very far without. This is especially true when we are learning to program JavaScript (or any other language for that matter) — so much of what we do relies on processing numerical data, calculating new values, and so on, that you won't be surprised to learn that JavaScript has a full-featured set of math functions available.

This article discusses only the basic parts that you need to know now.

### Types of numbers

In programming, even the humble decimal number system that we all know so well is more complicated than you might think. We use different terms to describe different types of decimal numbers, for example:

- **Integers** are numbers without a fractional part. They can either be positive or negative, e.g., 10, 400, or -5.
- **Floating point numbers** (floats) have decimal points and decimal places, for example 12.5, and 56.7786543.

We even have different types of number systems! Decimal is base 10 (meaning it uses 0–9 in each digit), but we also have things like:

- **Binary** — The lowest level language of computers; 0s and 1s.
- **Octal** — Base 8, uses 0–7 in each digit.
- **Hexadecimal** — Base 16, uses 0–9 and then a–f in each digit. You may have encountered these numbers before when setting [colors in CSS](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Values_and_units#hexadecimal_rgb_values).

**Before you start to get worried about your brain melting, stop right there!** For a start, we are just going to stick to decimal numbers throughout this course; you'll rarely come across a need to start thinking about other types, if ever.

The second bit of good news is that unlike some other programming languages, JavaScript only has one data type for numbers, both integers and decimals — you guessed it, {{jsxref("Number")}}. This means that whatever type of numbers you are dealing with in JavaScript, you handle them in exactly the same way.

> [!NOTE]
> Actually, JavaScript has a second number type, {{Glossary("BigInt")}}, used for very, very large integers. But for the purposes of this course, we'll just worry about `Number` values.

### It's all numbers to me

Let's quickly play with some numbers to reacquaint ourselves with the basic syntax we need. Enter the commands listed below into your [developer tools JavaScript console](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools).

1. First of all, let's declare a couple of variables and initialize them with an integer and a float, respectively, then type the variable names back in to check that everything is in order:

   ```js
   const myInt = 5;
   const myFloat = 6.667;
   myInt;
   myFloat;
   ```

2. Number values are typed in without quote marks — try declaring and initializing a couple more variables containing numbers before you move on.
3. Now let's check that both our original variables are of the same datatype. There is an operator called {{jsxref("Operators/typeof", "typeof")}} in JavaScript that does this. Enter the below two lines as shown:

   ```js
   typeof myInt;
   typeof myFloat;
   ```

   You should get `"number"` returned in both cases — this makes things a lot easier for us than if different numbers had different data types, and we had to deal with them in different ways. Phew!

### Useful Number methods

The [`Number`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number) object, an instance of which represents all standard numbers you'll use in your JavaScript, has a number of useful methods available on it for you to manipulate numbers. We don't cover these in detail in this article because we wanted to keep it as an introduction and only cover the real basic essentials for now; however, once you've read through this module a couple of times it is worth going to the object reference pages and learning more about what's available.

For example, to round your number to a fixed number of decimal places, use the [`toFixed()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed) method. Type the following lines into your browser's [console](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/web_console/index.html):

```js
const lotsOfDecimal = 1.7665849587;
lotsOfDecimal;
const twoDecimalPlaces = lotsOfDecimal.toFixed(2);
twoDecimalPlaces;
```

### Converting to number data types

Sometimes you might end up with a number that is stored as a string type, which makes it difficult to perform calculations with it. This most commonly happens when data is entered into a [form](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms) input, and the [input type is text](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/text). There is a way to solve this problem — passing the string value into the [`Number()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/Number) constructor to return a number version of the same value.

For example, try typing these lines into your console:

```js
let myNumber = "74";
myNumber += 3;
```

You end up with the result 743, not 77, because `myNumber` is actually defined as a string. You can test this by typing in the following:

```js
typeof myNumber;
```

To fix the calculation, you can do this:

```js
let myNumber = "74";
myNumber = Number(myNumber) + 3;
```

The result is then 77, as initially expected.

## Arithmetic operators

Arithmetic operators are used for performing mathematical calculations in JavaScript:

<table class="standard-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Operator</th>
      <th scope="col">Name</th>
      <th scope="col">Purpose</th>
      <th scope="col">Example</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>+</code></td>
      <td>Addition</td>
      <td>Adds two numbers together.</td>
      <td><code>6 + 9</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>-</code></td>
      <td>Subtraction</td>
      <td>Subtracts the right number from the left.</td>
      <td><code>20 - 15</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
      <td>Multiplication</td>
      <td>Multiplies two numbers together.</td>
      <td><code>3 * 7</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>/</code></td>
      <td>Division</td>
      <td>Divides the left number by the right.</td>
      <td><code>10 / 5</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>%</code></td>
      <td>Remainder (sometimes called modulo)</td>
      <td>
        <p>
          Returns the remainder left over after you've divided the left number
          into a number of integer portions equal to the right number.
        </p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>
          <code>8 % 3</code> (returns 2, as three goes into 8 twice, leaving 2
          left over).
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>**</code></td>
      <td>Exponent</td>
      <td>
        Raises a <code>base</code> number to the <code>exponent</code> power,
        that is, the <code>base</code> number multiplied by itself,
        <code>exponent</code> times.
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>5 ** 2</code> (returns <code>25</code>, which is the same as
        <code>5 * 5</code>).
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

> [!NOTE]
> You'll sometimes see numbers involved in arithmetic referred to as {{Glossary("Operand", "operands")}}.

> [!NOTE]
> You may sometimes see exponents expressed using the older {{jsxref("Math.pow()")}} method, which works in a very similar way. For example, in `Math.pow(7, 3)`, `7` is the base and `3` is the exponent, so the result of the expression is `343`. `Math.pow(7, 3)` is equivalent to `7**3`.

We probably don't need to teach you how to do basic math, but we would like to test your understanding of the syntax involved. Try entering the examples below into your [developer tools JavaScript console](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools) to familiarize yourself with the syntax.

1. First try entering some simple examples of your own, such as

   ```js
   10 + 7;
   9 * 8;
   60 % 3;
   ```

2. You can also try declaring and initializing some numbers inside variables, and try using those in the sums — the variables will behave exactly like the values they hold for the purposes of the sum. For example:

   ```js
   const num1 = 10;
   const num2 = 50;
   9 * num1;
   num1 ** 3;
   num2 / num1;
   ```

3. Last for this section, try entering some more complex expressions, such as:

   ```js
   5 + 10 * 3;
   (num2 % 9) * num1;
   num2 + num1 / 8 + 2;
   ```

Parts of this last set of calculations might not give you quite the result you were expecting; the section below might well give the answer as to why.

### Operator precedence

Let's look at the last example from above, assuming that `num2` holds the value 50 and `num1` holds the value 10 (as originally stated above):

```js
num2 + num1 / 8 + 2;
```

As a human being, you may read this as _"50 plus 10 equals 60"_, then _"8 plus 2 equals 10"_, and finally _"60 divided by 10 equals 6"_.

But the browser does _"10 divided by 8 equals 1.25"_, then _"50 plus 1.25 plus 2 equals 53.25"_.

This is because of **operator precedence** — some operators are applied before others when calculating the result of a calculation (referred to as an _expression_, in programming). Operator precedence in JavaScript is the same as is taught in math classes in school — multiply and divide are always done first, then add and subtract (the calculation is always evaluated from left to right).

If you want to override operator precedence, you can put parentheses around the parts that you want to be explicitly dealt with first. So to get a result of 6, we could do this:

```js
(num2 + num1) / (8 + 2);
```

Try entering the previous line into the console to test this out.

> [!NOTE]
> A full list of all JavaScript operators and their precedence can be found in [Operator precedence](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_precedence).

## Increment and decrement operators

Sometimes you'll want to repeatedly add or subtract one to or from a numeric variable value. This can be conveniently done using the increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators. We used `++` in our "Guess the number" game back in our [first splash into JavaScript](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/A_first_splash) article, when we added 1 to our `guessCount` variable to keep track of how many guesses the user has left after each turn.

```js
guessCount++;
```

Let's try playing with these in your console. For a start, note that you can't apply these directly to a number, which might seem strange, but we are assigning a variable a new updated value, not operating on the value itself. The following will return an error:

```js example-bad
3++;
```

So, you can only increment an existing variable. Try this:

```js
let num1 = 4;
num1++;
```

Okay, strangeness number 2! When you do this, you'll see a value of 4 returned — this is because the browser returns the current value, _then_ increments the variable. You can see that it's been incremented if you return the variable value again:

```js
num1;
```

The same is true of `--` : try the following

```js
let num2 = 6;
num2--;
num2;
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can make the browser do it the other way round — increment/decrement the variable _then_ return the value — by putting the operator at the start of the variable instead of the end. Try the above examples again, but this time use `++num1` and `--num2`.

## Assignment operators

Assignment operators are operators that assign a value to a variable. We have already used the most basic one, `=`, many times — it assigns the variable on the left the value stated on the right:

```js
let x = 3; // x contains the value 3
let y = 4; // y contains the value 4
x = y; // x now contains the same value y contains, 4
```

But there are some more complex types, which provide useful shortcuts to keep your code neater and more efficient. The most common are listed below:

<table class="standard-table no-markdown">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Operator</th>
      <th scope="col">Name</th>
      <th scope="col">Purpose</th>
      <th scope="col">Example</th>
      <th scope="col">Shortcut for</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>+=</code></td>
      <td>Addition assignment</td>
      <td>
        Adds the value on the right to the variable value on the left, then
        returns the new variable value
      </td>
      <td><code>x += 4;</code></td>
      <td><code>x = x + 4;</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>-=</code></td>
      <td>Subtraction assignment</td>
      <td>
        Subtracts the value on the right from the variable value on the left,
        and returns the new variable value
      </td>
      <td><code>x -= 3;</code></td>
      <td><code>x = x - 3;</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>*=</code></td>
      <td>Multiplication assignment</td>
      <td>
        Multiplies the variable value on the left by the value on the right, and
        returns the new variable value
      </td>
      <td><code>x *= 3;</code></td>
      <td><code>x = x * 3;</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>/=</code></td>
      <td>Division assignment</td>
      <td>
        Divides the variable value on the left by the value on the right, and
        returns the new variable value
      </td>
      <td><code>x /= 5;</code></td>
      <td><code>x = x / 5;</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Try typing some of the above examples into your console, to get an idea of how they work. In each case, see if you can guess what the value is before you type in the second line.

Note that you can quite happily use other variables on the right-hand side of each expression, for example:

```js
let x = 3; // x contains the value 3
let y = 4; // y contains the value 4
x *= y; // x now contains the value 12
```

> [!NOTE]
> There are lots of [other assignment operators available](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_operators#assignment_operators), but these are the basic ones you should learn now.

## Sizing a canvas box

In this exercise, you will manipulate some numbers and operators to change the size of a box. The box is drawn using a browser API called the {{domxref("Canvas API", "", "", "true")}}. There is no need to worry about how this works — just concentrate on the math for now. The width and height of the box (in pixels) are defined by the variables `x` and `y`, which are initially both given a value of 50.

```html hidden live-sample___canvas-exercise
<canvas id="canvas" width="400" height="200"></canvas>
<p></p>
```

```js live-sample___canvas-exercise
const canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
const para = document.querySelector("p");
const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

// Edit the following two lines ONLY
let x = 50;
let y = 50;

ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
ctx.fillStyle = "green";
ctx.fillRect(10, 10, x, y);
para.textContent = `The rectangle is ${x}px wide and ${y}px high.`;
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("canvas-exercise", '100%', 300)}}

Open the above example in the MDN Playground by clicking the **"Play"** button, then follow the list of instructions below to make the box grow/shrink to certain sizes, using certain operators and/or values in each case:

- Change the line that calculates `x` so the box is still `50px` wide, but the 50 is calculated using the numbers 43 and 7 and an arithmetic operator.
- Change the line that calculates `y` so the box is `75px` high, but the 75 is calculated using the numbers 25 and 3 and an arithmetic operator.
- Change the line that calculates `x` so the box is `100px` wide, but the 100 is calculated using three numbers and the subtraction and division operators.
- Change the line that calculates `y` so the box is `200px` high, but the 200 is calculated using the numbers 2 and `x`, and the multiplication operator.

Don't worry if you mess the code up. You can always press the Reset button and start again.

## Comparison operators

Sometimes we will want to run true/false tests, then act accordingly depending on the result of that test — to do this we use **comparison operators**.

| Operator | Name                     | Purpose                                                                      | Example       |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `===`    | Strict equality          | Tests whether the left and right values are identical to one another         | `5 === 2 + 4` |
| `!==`    | Strict-non-equality      | Tests whether the left and right values are **not** identical to one another | `5 !== 2 + 3` |
| `<`      | Less than                | Tests whether the left value is smaller than the right one.                  | `10 < 6`      |
| `>`      | Greater than             | Tests whether the left value is greater than the right one.                  | `10 > 20`     |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to    | Tests whether the left value is smaller than or equal to the right one.      | `3 <= 2`      |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to | Tests whether the left value is greater than or equal to the right one.      | `5 >= 4`      |

> [!NOTE]
> You may see some people using `==` and `!=` in their tests for equality and non-equality. These are valid operators in JavaScript, but they differ from `===`/`!==`. The former versions test whether the values are the same but not whether the values' datatypes are the same. The latter, strict versions test the equality of both the values and their datatypes. The strict versions tend to result in fewer errors, so we recommend you use them.

If you try entering some of these values in a console, you'll see that they all return `true`/`false` values — those booleans we mentioned in the last article. These are very useful, as they allow us to make decisions in our code, and they are used every time we want to make a choice of some kind. For example, booleans can be used to:

- Display the correct text label on a button depending on whether a feature is turned on or off
- Display a game over message if a game is over or a victory message if the game has been won
- Display the correct seasonal greeting depending on what holiday season it is
- Zoom a map in or out depending on what zoom level is selected

We'll look at how to code such logic when we look at conditional statements in a future article. For now, let's look at a quick example:

```html live-sample___conditional
<button>Start machine</button>
<p>The machine is stopped.</p>
```

```js live-sample___conditional
const btn = document.querySelector("button");
const txt = document.querySelector("p");

btn.addEventListener("click", updateBtn);

function updateBtn() {
  if (btn.textContent === "Start machine") {
    btn.textContent = "Stop machine";
    txt.textContent = "The machine has started!";
  } else {
    btn.textContent = "Start machine";
    txt.textContent = "The machine is stopped.";
  }
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("conditional", '100%', 100)}}

You can see the equality operator being used just inside the `updateBtn()` function. In this case, we are not testing if two mathematical expressions have the same value — we are testing whether the text content of a button contains a certain string — but it is still the same principle at work. If the button is currently saying "Start machine" when it is pressed, we change its label to "Stop machine", and update the label as appropriate. If the button is currently saying "Stop machine" when it is pressed, we swap the display back again.

> [!NOTE]
> Such a control that swaps between two states is generally referred to as a **toggle**. It toggles between one state and another — light on, light off, etc.

## Summary

In this article, we have covered the fundamental information you need to know about numbers in JavaScript, for now. You'll see numbers used again and again, all the way through your JavaScript learning, so it's a good idea to get this out of the way now. If you are one of those people that doesn't enjoy math, you can take comfort in the fact that this chapter was pretty short.

In the next article, we'll give you some tests that you can use to check how well you've understood and retained this information.

# Making network requests with JavaScript

{{PreviousMenuNext("Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Image_gallery","Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/JSON", "Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting")}}

Another very common task in modern websites and applications is making network requests to retrieve individual data items from the server to update sections of a webpage without having to load an entire new page. This seemingly small detail has had a huge impact on the performance and behavior of sites, so in this article, we'll explain the concept and look at technologies that make it possible: in particular, the [Fetch API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

## What is the problem here?

A web page consists of an HTML page and (usually) various other files, such as stylesheets, scripts, and images. The basic model of page loading on the Web is that your browser makes one or more HTTP requests to the server for the files needed to display the page, and the server responds with the requested files. If you visit another page, the browser requests the new files, and the server responds with them.

![Traditional page loading](traditional-loading.svg)

This model works perfectly well for many sites. But consider a website that's very data-driven. For example, a library website like the [Vancouver Public Library](https://www.vpl.ca/). Among other things you could think of a site like this as a user interface to a database. It might let you search for a particular genre of book, or might show you recommendations for books you might like, based on books you've previously borrowed. When you do this, it needs to update the page with the new set of books to display. But note that most of the page content — including items like the page header, sidebar, and footer — stays the same.

The trouble with the traditional model here is that we'd have to fetch and load the entire page, even when we only need to update one part of it. This is inefficient and can result in a poor user experience.

So instead of the traditional model, many websites use JavaScript APIs to request data from the server and update the page content without a page load. So when the user searches for a new product, the browser only requests the data which is needed to update the page — the set of new books to display, for instance.

![Using fetch to update pages](fetch-update.svg)

The main API here is the [Fetch API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API). This enables JavaScript running in a page to make an [HTTP](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) request to a server to retrieve specific resources. When the server provides them, the JavaScript can use the data to update the page, typically by using [DOM manipulation APIs](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/DOM_scripting). The data requested is often [JSON](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/JSON), which is a good format for transferring structured data, but can also be HTML or just text.

This is a common pattern for data-driven sites such as Amazon, YouTube, eBay, and so on. With this model:

- Page updates are a lot quicker and you don't have to wait for the page to refresh, meaning that the site feels faster and more responsive.
- Less data is downloaded on each update, meaning less wasted bandwidth. This may not be such a big issue on a desktop on a broadband connection, but it's a major issue on mobile devices and in countries that don't have ubiquitous fast internet service.

> [!NOTE]
> In the early days, this general technique was known as [Asynchronous](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Asynchronous) JavaScript and XML ([AJAX](/en-US/docs/Glossary/AJAX)), because it tended to request XML data. This is normally not the case these days (you'd be more likely to request JSON), but the result is still the same, and the term "AJAX" is still often used to describe the technique.

To speed things up even further, some sites also store assets and data on the user's computer when they are first requested, meaning that on subsequent visits they use the local versions instead of downloading fresh copies every time the page is first loaded. The content is only reloaded from the server when it has been updated.

## The Fetch API

In this section we'll walk through a couple of examples of the Fetch API.

The examples below are of a certain level of complexity, and show how to use the Fetch API in some real world contexts. If you have never used fetch before, you might want to start by working through Scrimba's [First fetch](https://scrimba.com/frontend-path-c0j/~0lu?via=mdn) <sup>[_MDN learning partner_](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Learning_content#partner_links_and_embeds)</sup> interactive tutorial, which provides a very simple intro walkthrough.

### Fetching text content

For this example, we'll request data out of a few different text files and use them to populate a content area.

This series of files will act as our fake database; in a real application, we'd be more likely to use a server-side language like PHP, Python, or Node to request our data from a database. Here, however, we want to keep it simple and concentrate on the client-side part of this.

To begin this example, make a local copy of [fetch-start.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/apis/fetching-data/fetch-start.html) and the four text files — [verse1.txt](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/apis/fetching-data/verse1.txt), [verse2.txt](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/apis/fetching-data/verse2.txt), [verse3.txt](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/apis/fetching-data/verse3.txt), and [verse4.txt](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/apis/fetching-data/verse4.txt) — in a new directory on your computer. In this example, we will fetch a different verse of the poem (which you may well recognize) when it's selected in the drop-down menu.

Just inside the {{htmlelement("script")}} element, add the following code. This stores references to the {{htmlelement("select")}} and {{htmlelement("pre")}} elements and adds a listener to the `<select>` element, so that when the user selects a new value, the new value is passed to the function named `updateDisplay()` as a parameter.

```js
const verseChoose = document.querySelector("select");
const poemDisplay = document.querySelector("pre");

verseChoose.addEventListener("change", () => {
  const verse = verseChoose.value;
  updateDisplay(verse);
});
```

Let's define our `updateDisplay()` function. First of all, put the following beneath your previous code block — this is the empty shell of the function.

```js-nolint
function updateDisplay(verse) {

}
```

We'll start our function by constructing a relative URL pointing to the text file we want to load, as we'll need it later. The value of the {{htmlelement("select")}} element at any time is the same as the text inside the selected {{htmlelement("option")}} (unless you specify a different value in a value attribute) — so for example "Verse 1". The corresponding verse text file is "verse1.txt", and is in the same directory as the HTML file, therefore just the file name will do.

However, web servers tend to be case-sensitive, and the file name doesn't have a space in it. To convert "Verse 1" to "verse1.txt" we need to convert the 'V' to lower case, remove the space, and add ".txt" on the end. This can be done with {{jsxref("String.replace", "replace()")}}, {{jsxref("String.toLowerCase", "toLowerCase()")}}, and [template literal](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals). Add the following lines inside your `updateDisplay()` function:

```js
verse = verse.replace(" ", "").toLowerCase();
const url = `${verse}.txt`;
```

Finally we're ready to use the Fetch API:

```js
// Call `fetch()`, passing in the URL.
fetch(url)
  // fetch() returns a promise. When we have received a response from the server,
  // the promise's `then()` handler is called with the response.
  .then((response) => {
    // Our handler throws an error if the request did not succeed.
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error: ${response.status}`);
    }
    // Otherwise (if the response succeeded), our handler fetches the response
    // as text by calling response.text(), and immediately returns the promise
    // returned by `response.text()`.
    return response.text();
  })
  // When response.text() has succeeded, the `then()` handler is called with
  // the text, and we copy it into the `poemDisplay` box.
  .then((text) => {
    poemDisplay.textContent = text;
  })
  // Catch any errors that might happen, and display a message
  // in the `poemDisplay` box.
  .catch((error) => {
    poemDisplay.textContent = `Could not fetch verse: ${error}`;
  });
```

There's quite a lot to unpack in here.

First, the entry point to the Fetch API is a global function called {{domxref("Window/fetch", "fetch()")}}, that takes the URL as a parameter (it takes another optional parameter for custom settings, but we're not using that here).

Next, `fetch()` is an asynchronous API which returns a {{jsxref("Promise")}}. If you don't know what that is, read the module on [asynchronous JavaScript](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Async_JS), and in particular the lesson on [promises](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Async_JS/Promises), then come back here. You'll find that article also talks about the `fetch()` API!

So because `fetch()` returns a promise, we pass a function into the {{jsxref("Promise/then", "then()")}} method of the returned promise. This method will be called when the HTTP request has received a response from the server. In the handler, we check that the request succeeded, and throw an error if it didn't. Otherwise, we call {{domxref("Response/text", "response.text()")}}, to get the response body as text.

It turns out that `response.text()` is _also_ asynchronous, so we return the promise it returns, and pass a function into the `then()` method of this new promise. This function will be called when the response text is ready, and inside it we will update our `<pre>` block with the text.

Finally, we chain a {{jsxref("Promise/catch", "catch()")}} handler at the end, to catch any errors thrown in either of the asynchronous functions we called or their handlers.

One problem with the example as it stands is that it won't show any of the poem when it first loads. To fix this, add the following two lines at the bottom of your code (just above the closing `</script>` tag) to load verse 1 by default, and make sure the {{htmlelement("select")}} element always shows the correct value:

```js
updateDisplay("Verse 1");
verseChoose.value = "Verse 1";
```

#### Serving your example from a server

Modern browsers will not run HTTP requests if you just run the example from a local file. This is because of security restrictions (for more on web security, read [Website security](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side/First_steps/Website_security)).

To get around this, we need to test the example by running it through a local web server. To find out how to do this, see [How do you set up a local testing server?](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/set_up_a_local_testing_server).

### The can store

In this example we have created a sample site called The Can Store — it's a fictional supermarket that only sells canned goods. You can find this [example live on GitHub](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/apis/fetching-data/can-store/), and [see the source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/tree/main/javascript/apis/fetching-data/can-store).

![A fake e-commerce site showing search options in the left hand column, and product search results in the right-hand column.](can-store.png)

By default, the site displays all the products, but you can use the form controls in the left-hand column to filter them by category, or search term, or both.

There is quite a lot of complex code that deals with filtering the products by category and search terms, manipulating strings so the data displays correctly in the UI, etc. We won't discuss all of it in the article, but you can find extensive comments in the code (see [can-script.js](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/apis/fetching-data/can-store/can-script.js)).

We will, however, explain the Fetch code.

The first block that uses Fetch can be found at the start of the JavaScript:

```js
fetch("products.json")
  .then((response) => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error: ${response.status}`);
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then((json) => initialize(json))
  .catch((err) => console.error(`Fetch problem: ${err.message}`));
```

The `fetch()` function returns a promise. If this completes successfully, the function inside the first `.then()` block contains the `response` returned from the network.

Inside this function we:

- check that the server didn't return an error (such as [`404 Not Found`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/404)). If it did, we throw the error.
- call {{domxref("Response.json","json()")}} on the response. This will retrieve the data as a [JSON object](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/JSON). We return the promise returned by `response.json()`.

Next we pass a function into the `then()` method of that returned promise. This function will be passed an object containing the response data as JSON, which we pass into the `initialize()` function. It is `initialize()` which starts the process of displaying all the products in the user interface.

To handle errors, we chain a `.catch()` block onto the end of the chain. This runs if the promise fails for some reason. Inside it, we include a function that is passed as a parameter, an `err` object. This `err` object can be used to report the nature of the error that has occurred, in this case we do it with a simple `console.error()`.

However, a complete website would handle this error more gracefully by displaying a message on the user's screen and perhaps offering options to remedy the situation, but we don't need anything more than a simple `console.error()`.

You can test the failure case yourself:

<!-- cSpell:ignore produc -->

1. Make a local copy of the example files.
2. Run the code through a web server (as described above, in [Serving your example from a server](#serving_your_example_from_a_server)).
3. Modify the path to the file being fetched, to something like 'produc.json' (make sure it is misspelled).
4. Now load the index file in your browser (via `localhost:8000`) and look in your browser developer console. You'll see a message similar to "Fetch problem: HTTP error: 404".

The second Fetch block can be found inside the `fetchBlob()` function:

```js
fetch(url)
  .then((response) => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error: ${response.status}`);
    }
    return response.blob();
  })
  .then((blob) => showProduct(blob, product))
  .catch((err) => console.error(`Fetch problem: ${err.message}`));
```

This works in much the same way as the previous one, except that instead of using {{domxref("Response.json","json()")}}, we use {{domxref("Response.blob","blob()")}}. In this case we want to return our response as an image file, and the data format we use for that is [Blob](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob) (the term is an abbreviation of "Binary Large Object" and can basically be used to represent large file-like objects, such as images or video files).

Once we've successfully received our blob, we pass it into our `showProduct()` function, which displays it.

## The XMLHttpRequest API

Sometimes, especially in older code, you'll see another API called [`XMLHttpRequest`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) (often abbreviated as "XHR") used to make HTTP requests. This predated Fetch, and was really the first API widely used to implement AJAX. We recommend you use Fetch if you can: it's a simpler API and has more features than `XMLHttpRequest`. We won't go through an example that uses `XMLHttpRequest`, but we will show you what the `XMLHttpRequest` version of our first can store request would look like:

```js
const request = new XMLHttpRequest();

try {
  request.open("GET", "products.json");

  request.responseType = "json";

  request.addEventListener("load", () => initialize(request.response));
  request.addEventListener("error", () => console.error("XHR error"));

  request.send();
} catch (error) {
  console.error(`XHR error ${request.status}`);
}
```

There are five stages to this:

1. Create a new `XMLHttpRequest` object.
2. Call its [`open()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/open) method to initialize it.
3. Add an event listener to its [`load`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequestEventTarget/load_event) event, which fires when the response has completed successfully. In the listener we call `initialize()` with the data.
4. Add an event listener to its [`error`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequestEventTarget/error_event) event, which fires when the request encounters an error
5. Send the request.

We also have to wrap the whole thing in the [try...catch](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch) block, to handle any errors thrown by `open()` or `send()`.

Hopefully you think the Fetch API is an improvement over this. In particular, see how we have to handle errors in two different places.

In this article, we'll look at fundamental JavaScript object syntax, and revisit some JavaScript features that we've already seen earlier in the course, reiterating the fact that many of the features you've already dealt with are objects.

## Object basics

An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality.
These usually consist of several variables and functions (which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects).
Let's work through an example to understand what they look like.

To begin with, make a local copy of our [oojs.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/oojs/introduction/oojs.html) file. This contains very little — a {{HTMLElement("script")}} element for us to write our source code into. We'll use this as a basis for exploring basic object syntax. While working with this example you should have your [developer tools JavaScript console](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools#the_javascript_console) open and ready to type in some commands.

As with many things in JavaScript, creating an object often begins with defining and initializing a variable. Try entering the following line below the JavaScript code that's already in your file, then saving and refreshing:

```js
const person = {};
```

Now open your browser's [JavaScript console](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools#the_javascript_console), enter `person` into it, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>/<kbd>Return</kbd>. You should get a result similar to one of the below lines:

```plain
[object Object]
Object { }
{ }
```

Congratulations, you've just created your first object. Job done! But this is an empty object, so we can't really do much with it. Let's update the JavaScript object in our file to look like this:

```js
const person = {
  name: ["Bob", "Smith"],
  age: 32,
  bio: function () {
    console.log(`${this.name[0]} ${this.name[1]} is ${this.age} years old.`);
  },
  introduceSelf: function () {
    console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name[0]}.`);
  },
};
```

After saving and refreshing, try entering some of the following into the JavaScript console on your browser devtools:

```js
person.name;
person.name[0];
person.age;
person.bio();
// "Bob Smith is 32 years old."
person.introduceSelf();
// "Hi! I'm Bob."
```

You have now got some data and functionality inside your object, and are now able to access them with some nice simple syntax!

So what is going on here? Well, an object is made up of multiple members, each of which has a name (e.g., `name` and `age` above), and a value (e.g., `['Bob', 'Smith']` and `32`). Each name/value pair must be separated by a comma, and the name and value in each case are separated by a colon. The syntax always follows this pattern:

```js
const objectName = {
  member1Name: member1Value,
  member2Name: member2Value,
  member3Name: member3Value,
};
```

The value of an object member can be pretty much anything — in our person object we've got a number, an array, and two functions. The first two items are data items, and are referred to as the object's **properties**. The last two items are functions that allow the object to do something with that data, and are referred to as the object's **methods**.

When the object's members are functions there's a simpler syntax. Instead of `bio: function ()` we can write `bio()`. Like this:

```js
const person = {
  name: ["Bob", "Smith"],
  age: 32,
  bio() {
    console.log(`${this.name[0]} ${this.name[1]} is ${this.age} years old.`);
  },
  introduceSelf() {
    console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name[0]}.`);
  },
};
```

From now on, we'll use this shorter syntax.

An object like this is referred to as an **object literal** — we've literally written out the object contents as we've come to create it. This is different compared to objects instantiated from classes, which we'll look at later on.

It is very common to create an object using an object literal when you want to transfer a series of structured, related data items in some manner, for example sending a request to the server to be put into a database. Sending a single object is much more efficient than sending several items individually, and it is easier to work with than an array, when you want to identify individual items by name.

## Dot notation

Above, you accessed the object's properties and methods using **dot notation**. The object name (person) acts as the **namespace** — it must be entered first to access anything inside the object. Next you write a dot, then the item you want to access — this can be the name of a simple property, an item of an array property, or a call to one of the object's methods, for example:

```js
person.age;
person.bio();
```

### Objects as object properties

An object property can itself be an object. For example, try changing the `name` member from

```js
const person = {
  name: ["Bob", "Smith"],
};
```

to

```js
const person = {
  name: {
    first: "Bob",
    last: "Smith",
  },
  // …
};
```

To access these items you just need to chain the extra step onto the end with another dot. Try these in the JS console:

```js
person.name.first;
person.name.last;
```

If you do this, you'll also need to go through your method code and change any instances of

```js
name[0];
name[1];
```

to

```js
name.first;
name.last;
```

Otherwise, your methods will no longer work.

## Bracket notation

Bracket notation provides an alternative way to access object properties.
Instead of using [dot notation](#dot_notation) like this:

```js
person.age;
person.name.first;
```

You can instead use square brackets:

```js
person["age"];
person["name"]["first"];
```

This looks very similar to how you access the items in an array, and it is basically the same thing — instead of using an index number to select an item, you are using the name associated with each member's value.
It is no wonder that objects are sometimes called **associative arrays** — they map strings to values in the same way that arrays map numbers to values.

Dot notation is generally preferred over bracket notation because it is more succinct and easier to read.
However there are some cases where you have to use square brackets.
For example, if an object property name is held in a variable, then you can't use dot notation to access the value, but you can access the value using bracket notation.

In the example below, the `logProperty()` function can use `person[propertyName]` to retrieve the value of the property named in `propertyName`.

```js
const person = {
  name: ["Bob", "Smith"],
  age: 32,
};

function logProperty(propertyName) {
  console.log(person[propertyName]);
}

logProperty("name");
// ["Bob", "Smith"]
logProperty("age");
// 32
```

## Setting object members

So far we've only looked at retrieving (or **getting**) object members — you can also **set** (update) the value of object members by declaring the member you want to set (using dot or bracket notation), like this:

```js
person.age = 45;
person["name"]["last"] = "Cratchit";
```

Try entering the above lines, and then getting the members again to see how they've changed, like so:

```js
person.age;
person["name"]["last"];
```

Setting members doesn't just stop at updating the values of existing properties and methods; you can also create completely new members. Try these in the JS console:

```js
person["eyes"] = "hazel";
person.farewell = function () {
  console.log("Bye everybody!");
};
```

You can now test out your new members:

```js
person["eyes"];
person.farewell();
// "Bye everybody!"
```

One useful aspect of bracket notation is that it can be used to set not only member values dynamically, but member names too. Let's say we wanted users to be able to store custom value types in their people data, by typing the member name and value into two text inputs. We could get those values like this:

```js
const myDataName = nameInput.value;
const myDataValue = nameValue.value;
```

We could then add this new member name and value to the `person` object like this:

```js
person[myDataName] = myDataValue;
```

To test this, try adding the following lines into your code, just below the closing curly brace of the `person` object:

```js
const myDataName = "height";
const myDataValue = "1.75m";
person[myDataName] = myDataValue;
```

Now try saving and refreshing, and entering the following into your text input:

```js
person.height;
```

Adding a property to an object using the method above isn't possible with dot notation, which can only accept a literal member name, not a variable value pointing to a name.

## What is "this"?

You may have noticed something slightly strange in our methods. Look at this one for example:

```js
const person = {
  // …
  introduceSelf() {
    console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name[0]}.`);
  },
};
```

You are probably wondering what "this" is. The `this` keyword typically refers to the current object the code is being executed in. In the context of an object method, `this` refers to the object that the method was called on.

Let's illustrate what we mean with a simplified pair of person objects:

```js
const person1 = {
  name: "Chris",
  introduceSelf() {
    console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}.`);
  },
};

const person2 = {
  name: "Deepti",
  introduceSelf() {
    console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}.`);
  },
};
```

In this case, `person1.introduceSelf()` outputs "Hi! I'm Chris."; `person2.introduceSelf()` outputs "Hi! I'm Deepti." This happens because when the method is called, `this` refers to the object on which the method is called, which allows the same method definition to work for multiple objects.

This isn't hugely useful when you are writing out object literals by hand, as using the object's name (`person1` and `person2`) leads to the exact same result, but it will be essential when we start using **constructors** to create more than one object from a single object definition, and that's the subject of the next section.

## Introducing constructors

Using object literals is fine when you only need to create one object, but if you have to create more than one, as in the previous section, they're seriously inadequate. We have to write out the same code for every object we create, and if we want to change some properties of the object - like adding a `height` property - then we have to remember to update every object.

We would like a way to define the "shape" of an object — the set of methods and the properties it can have — and then create as many objects as we like, just updating the values for the properties that are different.

The first version of this is just a function:

```js
function createPerson(name) {
  const obj = {};
  obj.name = name;
  obj.introduceSelf = function () {
    console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}.`);
  };
  return obj;
}
```

This function creates and returns a new object each time we call it. The object will have two members:

- a property `name`
- a method `introduceSelf()`.

Note that `createPerson()` takes a parameter `name` to set the value of the `name` property, but the value of the `introduceSelf()` method will be the same for all objects created using this function. This is a very common pattern for creating objects.

Now we can create as many objects as we like, reusing the definition:

```js
const salva = createPerson("Salva");
salva.introduceSelf();
// "Hi! I'm Salva."

const frankie = createPerson("Frankie");
frankie.introduceSelf();
// "Hi! I'm Frankie."
```

This works fine but is a bit long-winded: we have to create an empty object, initialize it, and return it. A better way is to use a **constructor**. A constructor is just a function called using the {{jsxref("operators/new", "new")}} keyword. When you call a constructor, it will:

- create a new object
- bind `this` to the new object, so you can refer to `this` in your constructor code
- run the code in the constructor
- return the new object.

Constructors, by convention, start with a capital letter and are named for the type of object they create. So we could rewrite our example like this:

```js
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.introduceSelf = function () {
    console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}.`);
  };
}
```

To call `Person()` as a constructor, we use `new`:

```js
const salva = new Person("Salva");
salva.introduceSelf();
// "Hi! I'm Salva."

const frankie = new Person("Frankie");
frankie.introduceSelf();
// "Hi! I'm Frankie."
```

## You've been using objects all along

As you've been going through these examples, you have probably been thinking that the dot notation you've been using is very familiar. That's because you've been using it throughout the course! Every time we've been working through an example that uses a built-in browser API or JavaScript object, we've been using objects, because such features are built using exactly the same kind of object structures that we've been looking at here, albeit more complex ones than in our own basic custom examples.

So when you used string methods like:

```js
myString.split(",");
```

You were using a method available on a [`String`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) object. Every time you create a string in your code, that string is automatically created as an instance of `String`, and therefore has several common methods and properties available on it.

When you accessed the document object model using lines like this:

```js
const myDiv = document.createElement("div");
const myVideo = document.querySelector("video");
```

You were using methods available on a [`Document`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document) object. For each webpage loaded, an instance of `Document` is created, called `document`, which represents the entire page's structure, content, and other features such as its URL. Again, this means that it has several common methods and properties available on it.

The same is true of pretty much any other built-in object or API you've been using — [`Array`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array), [`Math`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math), and so on.

Note that built in objects and APIs don't always create object instances automatically. As an example, the [Notifications API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API) — which allows modern browsers to fire system notifications — requires you to instantiate a new object instance using the constructor for each notification you want to fire. Try entering the following into your JavaScript console:

```js
const myNotification = new Notification("Hello!");
```

## Summary

You should now have a good idea of how to work with objects in JavaScript — including creating your own simple objects. You should also appreciate that objects are very useful as structures for storing related data and functionality — if you tried to keep track of all the properties and methods in our `person` object as separate variables and functions, it would be inefficient and frustrating, and we'd run the risk of clashing with other variables and functions that have the same names. Objects let us keep the information safely locked away in their own package, out of harm's way.

In the next article, we'll give you some tests that you can use to check how well you've understood and retained all this information.

# Function return values

{{PreviousMenuNext("Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Build_your_own_function","Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Test_your_skills/Functions", "Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting")}}

There's one last essential concept about functions for us to discuss — return values. Some functions don't return a significant value, but others do. It's important to understand what their values are, how to use them in your code, and how to make functions return useful values. We'll cover all of these below.

## What are return values?

**Return values** are just what they sound like — the values that a function returns when it completes. You've already met return values several times, although you may not have thought about them explicitly.

Let's return to a familiar example (from a [previous article](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Functions#built-in_browser_functions) in this series):

```js
const myText = "The weather is cold";
const newString = myText.replace("cold", "warm");
console.log(newString); // Should print "The weather is warm"
// the replace() string function takes a string,
// replaces one substring with another, and returns
// a new string with the replacement made
```

The [`replace()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace) function is invoked on the `myText` string, and is passed two parameters:

- The substring to find (`"cold"`).
- The string to replace it with (`"warm"`).

When the function completes (finishes running), it returns a value, which is a new string with the replacement made. In the code above, the result of this return value is saved in the variable `newString`.

If you look at the [`replace()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace) function MDN reference page, you'll see a section called [return value](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace#return_value). It is very useful to know and understand what values are returned by functions, so we try to include this information wherever possible.

Some functions don't return any value. (In these cases, our reference pages list the return value as [`void`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/void) or [`undefined`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined).) For example, in the [`displayMessage()`](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/building-blocks/functions/function-stage-4.html#L50) function we built in the previous article, no specific value is returned when the function is invoked. It just makes a box appear somewhere on the screen — that's it!

Generally, a return value is used where the function is an intermediate step in a calculation of some kind. You want to get to a final result, which involves some values that need to be calculated by a function. After the function calculates the value, it can return the result so it can be stored in a variable; and you can use this variable in the next stage of the calculation.

## How to return a value

To return a value from a custom function, you need to use the [`return`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/return) keyword. We saw this in action recently in our [random-canvas-circles.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/building-blocks/loops/random-canvas-circles.html) example. Our `draw()` function draws 100 random circles somewhere on an HTML {{htmlelement("canvas")}}:

```js
function draw() {
  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.fillStyle = "rgb(255 0 0 / 50%)";
    ctx.arc(random(WIDTH), random(HEIGHT), random(50), 0, 2 * Math.PI);
    ctx.fill();
  }
}
```

Inside each loop iteration, three calls are made to the `random()` function, to generate a random value for the current circle's _x-coordinate_, _y-coordinate_, and _radius_, respectively. The `random()` function takes one parameter — a whole number — and returns a random whole number between `0` and that number. It looks like this:

```js
function random(number) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * number);
}
```

This could be written as follows:

```js
function random(number) {
  const result = Math.floor(Math.random() * number);
  return result;
}
```

But the first version is quicker to write, and more compact.

We are returning the result of the calculation `Math.floor(Math.random() * number)` each time the function is called. This return value appears at the point the function was called, and the code continues.

So when you execute the following:

```js
ctx.arc(random(WIDTH), random(HEIGHT), random(50), 0, 2 * Math.PI);
```

If the three `random()` calls returned the values `500`, `200`, and `35`, respectively, the line would actually be run as if it were this:

```js
ctx.arc(500, 200, 35, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
```

The function calls on the line are run first, and their return values are substituted for the function calls, before the line itself is then executed.

## Implementing function return values

Let's have a go at writing some functions featuring return values.

1. Make a local copy of the [function-library.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/building-blocks/functions/function-library.html) file from GitHub. This is a simple HTML page containing a text {{htmlelement("input")}} field and a paragraph. There's also a {{htmlelement("script")}} element, in which we have stored a reference to both HTML elements in two variables. This page will allow you to enter a number into the text box, and display different numbers related to it below.

2. Add some useful functions to this `<script>` element below the two existing lines:

   ```js
   function squared(num) {
     return num * num;
   }

   function cubed(num) {
     return num * num * num;
   }

   function factorial(num) {
     if (num < 0) return undefined;
     if (num === 0) return 1;
     let x = num - 1;
     while (x > 1) {
       num *= x;
       x--;
     }
     return num;
   }
   ```

   The `squared()` and `cubed()` functions are fairly obvious — they return the square or cube of the number that was given as a parameter. The `factorial()` function returns the [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) of the given number.

3. Include a way to print out information about the number entered into the text input by adding the following event handler below the existing functions:

   ```js
   input.addEventListener("change", () => {
     const num = parseFloat(input.value);
     if (isNaN(num)) {
       para.textContent = "You need to enter a number!";
     } else {
       para.textContent = `${num} squared is ${squared(num)}. `;
       para.textContent += `${num} cubed is ${cubed(num)}. `;
       para.textContent += `${num} factorial is ${factorial(num)}. `;
     }
   });
   ```

4. Save your code, load it in a browser, and try it out.

Here are some explanations for the `addEventListener()` function in step 3 above:

- By adding a `change` event listener, this function runs whenever the `change` event fires on the text input — that is when a new value is entered into the text `input`, and submitted (enter a value, then un-focus the input by pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Return</kbd>). When this anonymous function runs, the value in the `input` is stored in the `num` constant.
- The `if` statement prints an error message if the entered value is not a number. The condition checks if the expression `isNaN(num)` returns `true`. The [`isNaN()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/isNaN) function tests whether the `num` value is not a number — if so, it returns `true`, and if not, it returns `false`.
- If the condition returns `false`, the `num` value is a number and the function prints out a sentence inside the paragraph element that states the square, cube, and factorial values of the number. The sentence calls the `squared()`, `cubed()`, and `factorial()` functions to calculate the required values.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have trouble getting the example to work, check your code against the [finished version on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/building-blocks/functions/function-library-finished.html) ([see it running live](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/building-blocks/functions/function-library-finished.html) also).

### Add some functions of your own!

At this point, we'd like you to have a go at writing out a couple of functions of your own and adding them to the library. How about the square or cube root of the number? Or the circumference of a circle with a given radius?

Some extra function-related tips:

- Look at another example of writing _error handling_ into functions. It is generally a good idea to check that any necessary parameters are validated, and that any optional parameters have some kind of default value provided. This way, your program will be less likely to throw errors.
- Think about the idea of creating a _function library_. As you go further into your programming career, you'll start doing the same kinds of things over and over again. It is a good idea to create your own library of utility functions to do these sorts of things. You can copy them over to new code, or even just apply them to HTML pages wherever you need them.

## Summary

So there we have it — functions are fun, very useful, and although there's a lot to talk about in regards to their syntax and functionality, they are fairly understandable.

In the next article, we'll give you some tests that you can use to check how well you've understood and retained all the information we gave you on functions in the last few articles.

- [Callback functions in JavaScript](https://www.impressivewebs.com/callback-functions-javascript/) — a common JavaScript pattern is to pass a function into another function _as an argument_. It is then called inside the first function. This is a little beyond the scope of this course, but worth studying before too long.

## Project brief

You have been provided with a few text strings and JavaScript functions; you need to write the necessary JavaScript to turn this into a working program, which does the following:

- Generates a silly story when the "Generate random story" button is pressed.
- Replaces the default name "Bob" in the story with a custom name, only if a custom name is entered into the "Enter custom name" text field before the generate button is pressed.
- Converts the default US weight and temperature quantities and units in the story into UK equivalents if the UK radio button is checked before the generate button is pressed.
- Generates a new random silly story every time the button is pressed.

### Initial variables and functions

In the JavaScript, below the "COMPLETE VARIABLE DEFINITIONS AND RANDOM FUNCTION" comment, you've got three constants that store references to:

- The "Enter custom name" text field: `customName`.
- The "Generate random story" button: `generateBtn`.
- The {{htmlelement("p")}} element at the bottom of the HTML body that the story will be copied into: `story`.

In addition, you've got a function called `randomValueFromArray()` that takes an array as input and returns one of the items stored inside the array at random.

Below the "RAW TEXT STRINGS" comment, you've got some commented text strings that will act as input into our program. We'd like you to uncomment these strings and store them inside constants like so:

1. Store the first set of three strings inside an array called `characters`.
2. Store the second set of three strings inside an array called `places`.
3. Store the third set of three strings inside an array called `events`.

### Completing the `returnRandomStoryString()` function

Below the "PARTIAL RETURN RANDOM STRING FUNCTION" comment you've got a partially-completed `returnRandomStoryString()` containing a long, commented string of text and a `return` statement that returns a value called `storyText`.

To complete this function:

1. Uncomment the long string of text and store it inside a variable called `storyText`. This should be a template literal.
2. Add three constants called `randomCharacter`, `randomPlace`, and `randomEvent` just above the template literal. These should be set equal to three `randomValueFromArray()` calls, which should return a random string from the `characters`, `places`, and `events` arrays, respectively.
3. In the template literal, replace the instances of `:insertx:`, `:inserty:`, and `:insertz:` with embedded expressions containing `randomCharacter`, `randomPlace`, and `randomEvent`, respectively.

### Completing the `generateStory()` function

Below the "EVENT LISTENER AND PARTIAL GENERATE FUNCTION DEFINITION" comment, you've got a couple of code items:

- A line that adds a `click` event listener to the `generateBtn` variable so that when the button it represents is clicked, the `generateStory()` function is run.
- A partially-completed `generateStory()` function definition. For the remainder of the challenge, you'll be filling in lines inside this function to complete it and make it work properly.

Follow these steps to complete the function:

1. Create a new variable called `newStory`, and set its value to equal a `returnRandomStoryString()` call. This function is needed so we can create a new random story each time the button is pressed. If we set `newStory` directly to `storyText`, we'd only be able to generate a new story once.
2. Inside the first `if` block, add a string replacement method call to replace the name `Bob` found in the `newStory` string with the `name` variable. In this block we are saying "If a value has been entered into the `customName` text input, replace `Bob` in the story with that custom name."
3. Inside the second `if` block, we are checking to see if the `uk` radio button has been selected. If so, we want to convert the weight and temperature values in the story from pounds and Fahrenheit into stones and Celsius. What you need to do is as follows:
   1. Look up the formulas for converting pounds to stone, and Fahrenheit to Celsius.
   2. Inside the line that defines the `weight` constant, replace `300` with a calculation that converts 300 pounds into stones. Concatenate `" stone"` onto the end of the result of the overall `Math.round()` call.
   3. Inside the line that defines the `temperature` variable, replace `94` with a calculation that converts 94 Fahrenheit into Celsius. Concatenate `" Celsius"` onto the end of the result of the overall `Math.round()` call.
   4. Just under the two variable definitions, add two more string replacement lines that replace `300 pounds` with the contents of the `weight` variable, and `94 Fahrenheit` with the contents of the `temperature` variable.
4. Finally, in the second-to-last line of the function, make the `textContent` property of the `story` variable (which references the paragraph) equal to `newStory`.

## Hints and tips

- You don't need to edit the HTML and CSS in any way.
- [`Math.round()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/round) is a built-in JavaScript method that rounds the result of a calculation to the nearest whole number.
- There are three instances of strings that need to be replaced. You could use the `replace()` method, or some other solution.

## Example

Your finished app should work like the following live example:

{{EmbedLiveSample("silly-story-finish", "100%", 500)}}

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

The finished JavaScript should look something like this:

```js live-sample___silly-story-finish
// 1. COMPLETE VARIABLE DEFINITIONS AND RANDOM FUNCTION

const customName = document.getElementById("custom-name");
const generateBtn = document.querySelector(".generate");
const story = document.querySelector(".story");

function randomValueFromArray(array) {
  const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length);
  return array[random];
}

// 2. RAW TEXT STRINGS

const characters = ["Willy the Goblin", "Big Daddy", "Father Christmas"];
const places = ["the soup kitchen", "Disneyland", "the White House"];
const events = [
  "spontaneously combusted",
  "melted into a puddle on the sidewalk",
  "turned into a slug and slithered away",
];

// 3. PARTIAL RETURN RANDOM STRING FUNCTION

function returnRandomStoryString() {
  const randomCharacter = randomValueFromArray(characters);
  const randomPlace = randomValueFromArray(places);
  const randomEvent = randomValueFromArray(events);

  let storyText = `It was 94 Fahrenheit outside, so ${randomCharacter} went for a walk. When they got to ${randomPlace}, they stared in horror for a few moments, then ${randomEvent}. Bob saw the whole thing, but was not surprised — ${randomCharacter} weighs 300 pounds, and it was a hot day.`;

  return storyText;
}

// 4. EVENT LISTENER AND PARTIAL GENERATE FUNCTION DEFINITION

generateBtn.addEventListener("click", generateStory);

function generateStory() {
  let newStory = returnRandomStoryString();

  if (customName.value !== "") {
    const name = customName.value;
    newStory = newStory.replace("Bob", name);
  }

  if (document.getElementById("uk").checked) {
    const weight = `${Math.round(300 / 14)} stone`;
    const temperature = `${Math.round((94 - 32) * (5 / 9))} Celsius`;
    newStory = newStory.replace("300 pounds", weight);
    newStory = newStory.replace("94 Fahrenheit", temperature);
  }

  story.textContent = newStory;
  story.style.visibility = "visible";
}
```

# Handling text — strings in JavaScript

{{PreviousMenuNext("Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Test_your_skills/Math", "Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Useful_string_methods", "Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting")}}

Next, we'll turn our attention to strings — this is what pieces of text are called in programming. In this article, we'll look at all the common things that you really ought to know about strings when learning JavaScript, such as creating strings, escaping quotes in strings, and joining strings together.

## The power of words

Words are very important to humans — they are a large part of how we communicate. Since the web is a largely text-based medium designed to allow humans to communicate and share information, it is useful for us to have control over the words that appear on it. {{glossary("HTML")}} provides structure and meaning to text, {{glossary("CSS")}} allows us to precisely style it, and JavaScript offers many features for manipulating strings. These include creating custom welcome messages and prompts, showing the right text labels when needed, sorting terms into the desired order, and much more.

Pretty much all of the programs we've shown you so far in the course have involved some string manipulation.

## Declaring strings

Strings are dealt with similarly to numbers at first glance, but when you dig deeper you'll start to see some notable differences. Let's start by entering some basic lines into the [browser developer console](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools) to familiarize ourselves.

To start with, enter the following lines:

```js
const string = "The revolution will not be televised.";
console.log(string);
```

Just like we did with numbers, we are declaring a variable, initializing it with a string value, and then returning the value. The only difference here is that when writing a string, you need to surround the value with quotes.

If you don't do this, or miss one of the quotes, you'll get an error. Try entering the following lines:

```js example-bad
const badString1 = This is a test;
const badString2 = 'This is a test;
const badString3 = This is a test';
```

These lines don't work because any text without quotes around it is interpreted as a variable name, property name, reserved word, or similar. If the browser doesn't recognize the unquoted text, then an error is raised (e.g., "missing; before statement"). If the browser can detect where a string starts but not its end (owing to the missing second quote), it may report an "unterminated string literal" error, or, in the console, jump to a new line and expect you to finish the string there. If your program is raising such errors, then go back and check all your strings to make sure you have no missing quotation marks.

The following will work if you previously defined the variable `string` — try it now:

```js
const badString = string;
console.log(badString);
```

`badString` is now set to have the same value as `string`.

### Single quotes, double quotes, and backticks

In JavaScript, you can choose single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), or backticks (`` ` ``) to wrap your strings in. All of the following will work:

```js-nolint
const single = 'Single quotes';
const double = "Double quotes";
const backtick = `Backtick`;

console.log(single);
console.log(double);
console.log(backtick);
```

You must use the same character for the start and end of a string, or you will get an error:

```js-nolint example-bad
const badQuotes = 'This is not allowed!";
```

Strings declared using single quotes and strings declared using double quotes are the same, and which you use is down to personal preference — although it is good practice to choose one style and use it consistently in your code.

Strings declared using backticks are a special kind of string called a [_template literal_](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals). Template literals mostly behave the same as normal strings, but they have some special properties:

- You can [embed JavaScript](#embedding_javascript) in them.
- You can declare template literals over [multiple lines](#multiline_strings).

## Embedding JavaScript

Inside a template literal, you can wrap JavaScript variables or expressions inside `${ }`, and the result will be included in the string:

```js
const name = "Chris";
const greeting = `Hello, ${name}`;
console.log(greeting); // "Hello, Chris"
```

You can use the same technique to join together two variables:

```js
const one = "Hello, ";
const two = "how are you?";
const joined = `${one}${two}`;
console.log(joined); // "Hello, how are you?"
```

Joining strings together like this is called _concatenation_.

### Concatenation in context

Let's have a look at concatenation being used in action:

```html live-sample___string-concat
<button>Press me</button>
<div id="greeting"></div>
```

```js live-sample___string-concat
const button = document.querySelector("button");

function greet() {
  const name = prompt("What is your name?");
  const greeting = document.querySelector("#greeting");
  greeting.textContent = `Hello ${name}, nice to see you!`;
}

button.addEventListener("click", greet);
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('string-concat', , '50', , , , , 'allow-modals')}}

Here, we are using the {{domxref("window.prompt()", "window.prompt()")}} function, which prompts the user to answer a question via a popup dialog box and then stores the text they enter inside a given variable — in this case `name`. We then display a string that inserts the name into a generic greeting message.

### Concatenation using "+"

You can use `${}` only with template literals, not normal strings. You can concatenate normal strings using the `+` operator:

```js
const greeting2 = "Hello";
const name2 = "Bob";
console.log(greeting2 + ", " + name2); // "Hello, Bob"
```

However, template literals usually give you more readable code:

```js
const greeting3 = "Howdy";
const name3 = "Ramesh";
console.log(`${greeting3}, ${name3}`); // "Howdy, Ramesh"
```

### Including expressions in strings

You can include JavaScript expressions in template literals, as well as just variables, and the results will be included in the result:

```js
const song = "Fight the Youth";
const score = 9;
const highestScore = 10;
const output = `I like the song ${song}. I gave it a score of ${
  (score / highestScore) * 100
}%.`;
console.log(output); // "I like the song Fight the Youth. I gave it a score of 90%."
```

## Multiline strings

Template literals respect the line breaks in the source code, so you can write strings that span multiple lines like this:

```js
const newline = `One day you finally knew
what you had to do, and began,`;
console.log(newline);

/*
One day you finally knew
what you had to do, and began,
*/
```

To have the equivalent output using a normal string you'd have to include line break characters (`\n`) in the string:

```js
const newline2 = "One day you finally knew\nwhat you had to do, and began,";
console.log(newline2);

/*
One day you finally knew
what you had to do, and began,
*/
```

See our [Template literals](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) reference page for more examples and details of advanced features.

## Including quotes in strings

Since we use quotes to indicate the start and end of strings, how can we include actual quotes in strings? We know that this won't work:

```js-nolint example-bad
const badQuotes = "She said "I think so!"";
```

One common option is to use one of the other characters to declare the string:

```js-nolint
const goodQuotes1 = 'She said "I think so!"';
const goodQuotes2 = `She said "I'm not going in there!"`;
```

Another option is to _escape_ the problem quotation mark. Escaping characters means that we do something to them to make sure they are recognized as text, not part of the code. In JavaScript, we do this by putting a backslash just before the character. Try this:

```js-nolint
const bigmouth = 'I\'ve got no right to take my place…';
console.log(bigmouth);
```

You can use the same technique to insert other special characters. See [Escape sequences](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#escape_sequences) for more details.

## Numbers vs. strings

What happens when we try to concatenate a string and a number? Let's try it in our console:

```js
const coolBandName = "Front ";
const number = 242;
console.log(coolBandName + number); // "Front 242"
```

You might expect this to return an error, but it works just fine. How numbers should be displayed as strings is fairly well-defined, so the browser automatically converts the number to a string and concatenates the two strings.

If you have a numeric variable that you want to convert to a string or a string variable that you want to convert to a number, you can use the following two constructs:

- The {{jsxref("Number/Number", "Number()")}} function converts anything passed to it into a number if it can. Try the following:

  ```js
  const myString = "123";
  const myNum = Number(myString);
  console.log(typeof myNum);
  // number
  ```

- Conversely, the {{jsxref("String/String", "String()")}} function converts its argument to a string. Try this:

  ```js
  const myNum2 = 123;
  const myString2 = String(myNum2);
  console.log(typeof myString2);
  // string
  ```

These constructs can be really useful in some situations. For example, if a user enters a number into a form's text field, it's a string. However, if you want to add this number to something, you'll need it to be a number, so you could pass it through `Number()` to handle this. We did exactly this in our [Number Guessing Game](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/introduction-to-js-1/first-splash/number-guessing-game.html), in the `checkGuess` function.

## Summary

So that's the very basics of strings covered in JavaScript. In the next article, we'll build on this, looking at some of the built-in methods available to strings in JavaScript and how we can use them to manipulate our strings into just the form we want.

# Test your skills: Arrays

{{PreviousMenuNext("Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Arrays", "Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Silly_story_generator", "Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting")}}

The aim of this skill test is to help you assess whether you've understood our [Arrays](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Arrays) article.

> [!NOTE]
> To get help, read our [Test your skills](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development#test_your_skills) usage guide. You can also reach out to us using one of our [communication channels](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels).

## Interactive challenge

First of all, we are giving you a fun, interactive arrays challenge created by our [learning partner](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Learning_content#partner_links_and_embeds), [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/home).

Watch the embedded scrim, and complete the task on the timeline (the little ghost icon) by following the instructions and editing the code. When you are done, you can resume watching the scrim to check how the teacher's solution matches up with yours.

<mdn-scrim-inline url="https://scrimba.com/learn-javascript-c0v/~05e" scrimtitle="Render images from an array" survey="true"></scrim-inline>

> [!NOTE]
> This task is somewhat of a stretch goal, given that it relies on JavaScript features you've not yet explicitly covered during the course. Give it your best shot, and search online for information on anything you are not sure about.

## Task 1

This task gives you some basic array practice:

1. Create an array of three items, and store it in a variable called `myArray`. The items can be anything you want — how about your favorite foods or bands?
2. Next, modify the first two items in the array using bracket notation and assignment.
3. Finally, add a new item to the beginning of the array.

<!-- Code shared across examples -->

```html hidden live-sample___arrays-1 live-sample___arrays-2 live-sample___arrays-3 live-sample___arrays-4

```

```css hidden live-sample___arrays-1 live-sample___arrays-2 live-sample___arrays-3 live-sample___arrays-4
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

p {
  color: purple;
  margin: 0.5em 0;
}
```

<!-- Example-specific code -->

```js live-sample___arrays-1
// Add your code here

// Don't edit the code below here!

const section = document.querySelector("section");
const para1 = document.createElement("p");
para1.textContent = `Array: ${myArray}`;
section.appendChild(para1);
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample("arrays-1", "100%", 60) }}

Your finished JavaScript should look something like this:

```js
const myArray = ["cats", "dogs", "chickens"];

myArray[0] = "horses";
myArray[1] = "pigs";

myArray.unshift("crocodiles");

// Don't edit the code below here!
// ...
```

</details>

## Task 2

Now let's move on to another task. Here you are provided with a string to work with.

To complete the task:

1. Convert the string into an array, removing the `+` characters in the process. Save the result in a variable called `myArray`.
2. Store the length of the array in a variable called `arrayLength`.
3. Store the last item in the array in a variable called `lastItem`.

```js live-sample___arrays-2
const myString = "Ryu+Ken+Chun-Li+Cammy+Guile+Sakura+Sagat+Juri";

// Add your code here

// Don't edit the code below here!

const section = document.querySelector("section");
const para1 = document.createElement("p");
para1.textContent = `Array: ${myArray}`;
const para2 = document.createElement("p");
para2.textContent = `The length of the array is ${arrayLength}.`;
const para3 = document.createElement("p");
para3.textContent = `The last item in the array is "${lastItem}".`;
section.appendChild(para1);
section.appendChild(para2);
section.appendChild(para3);
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample("arrays-2", "100%", 60) }}

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

Your finished JavaScript should look something like this:

```js
const myString = "Ryu+Ken+Chun-Li+Cammy+Guile+Sakura+Sagat+Juri";

let myArray = myString.split("+");

let arrayLength = myArray.length;

let lastItem = myArray[arrayLength - 1];

// Don't edit the code below here!
// ...
```

</details>

## Task 3

For this array task, we provide you with a starting array, and you will work in somewhat the opposite direction. You need to:

1. Remove the last item in the array.
2. Add two new names to the end of the array.
3. Iterate over each item in the array and add its index number after the name inside parentheses, for example `Ryu (0)`. Note that we don't teach how to do this in the Arrays article, so you'll have to do some research.
4. Finally, join the array items together in a single string called `myString`, with a separator of `"-"`.

```js live-sample___arrays-3
const myArray = [
  "Ryu",
  "Ken",
  "Chun-Li",
  "Cammy",
  "Guile",
  "Sakura",
  "Sagat",
  "Juri",
];

// Add your code here

// Don't edit the code below here!

const section = document.querySelector("section");
const para1 = document.createElement("p");
para1.textContent = myString;
section.appendChild(para1);
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample("arrays-3", "100%", 60) }}

<details>

Your finished JavaScript should look something like this:

```js
const myArray = [
  "Ryu",
  "Ken",
  "Chun-Li",
  "Cammy",
  "Guile",
  "Sakura",
  "Sagat",
  "Juri",
];

myArray.pop();

myArray.push("Zangief");
myArray.push("Ibuki");

myArray.forEach((element, index) => {
  const newElement = `${element} (${index})`;
  myArray[index] = newElement;
});

const myString = myArray.join(" - ");

// Don't edit the code below here!
// ...
```

</details>

## Task 4

For this array task, we provide you with a starting array listing the names of some birds.

To complete the task:

1. Find the index of the `"Eagles"` item, and use that to remove the `"Eagles"` item.
2. Make a new array from this one, called `eBirds`, that contains only birds from the original array whose names begin with the letter "E". Note that {{jsxref("String.prototype.startsWith()", "startsWith()")}} is a great way to check whether a string starts with a given character.

If it works, you should see `"Emus,Egrets"` appear in the page.

```js live-sample___arrays-4
const birds = ["Parrots", "Falcons", "Eagles", "Emus", "Caracaras", "Egrets"];

// Add your code here

// Don't edit the code below here!

const section = document.querySelector("section");
const para1 = document.createElement("p");
para1.textContent = eBirds;
section.appendChild(para1);
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample("arrays-4", "100%", 60) }}

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

Your finished JavaScript should look something like this:

```js
const birds = ["Parrots", "Falcons", "Eagles", "Emus", "Caracaras", "Egrets"];

const eaglesIndex = birds.indexOf("Eagles");
birds.splice(eaglesIndex, 1);

function startsWithE(bird) {
  return bird.startsWith("E");
}
const eBirds = birds.filter(startsWithE);

// Don't edit the code below here!
// ...
```

The aim of this skill test is to help you assess whether you've understood our [Making decisions in your code — conditionals](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Conditionals) article.

## Conditionals 1

In this task you are provided with two variables:

- `season` — contains a string that says what the current season is.
- `response` — begins uninitialized, but is later used to store a response that will be printed to the output panel.

To complete the task:

1. Create a conditional that checks whether `season` contains the string "summer", and if so assigns a string to `response` that gives the user an appropriate message about the season. If not, it should assign a generic string to `response` that tells the user we don't know what season it is.
2. Add another conditional that checks whether `season` contains the string "winter", and again assigns an appropriate string to `response`.

if (season === "summer") {
  response = "It's probably nice and warm where you are; enjoy the sun!";
} else if (season === "winter") {
  response = "I hope you are not too cold. Put some warm clothes on!";
} else {
  response =
    "I don't know what the season is where you are. Hope you are well.";
}

// Don't edit the code below here!
// ...
```

</details>

## Conditionals 2

For this task you are given three variables:

- `machineActive`: Contains an indicator of whether the answer machine is switched on or not (`true`/`false`).
- `score`: Contains your score in an imaginary game. This score is fed into the answer machine, which provides a response to indicate how well you did.
- `response`: Begins uninitialized, but is later used to store a response that will be printed to the output panel.

To complete the task:

1. Create an `if...else` structure that checks whether the machine is switched on and puts a message into the `response` variable if it isn't, telling the user to switch the machine on.
2. Inside the first `if...else`, nest another `if...else` that puts appropriate messages into the `response` variable depending on what the value of `score` is — if the machine is turned on. The different conditional tests (and resulting responses) are as follows:
   - Score of less than 0 or more than 100 — "This is not possible, an error has occurred."
   - Score of 0 to 19 — "That was a terrible score — total fail!"
   - Score of 20 to 39 — "You know some things, but it's a pretty bad score. Needs improvement."
   - Score of 40 to 69 — "You did a passable job, not bad!"
   - Score of 70 to 89 — "That's a great score, you really know your stuff."
   - Score of 90 to 100 — "What an amazing score! Did you cheat? Are you for real?"

After you've entered your code, try changing `machineActive` to `true`, and `score` to a few different values to see if it works.
Please note that, for the scope of this exercise, the `Your score is __` string will remain on the screen regardless of the `machineActive` variable's value.

```js live-sample___conditionals-2
let response;
let score = 75;
let machineActive = false;

// Add your code here

// Don't edit the code below here!

const section = document.querySelector("section");
const para1 = document.createElement("p");
const para2 = document.createElement("p");
para1.textContent = `Your score is ${score}`;
para2.textContent = response;
section.appendChild(para1);
section.appendChild(para2);
```

Your finished JavaScript should look something like this:

```js
let response;
let score = 75;
let machineActive = false;

if (machineActive) {
  if (score < 0 || score > 100) {
    response = "This is not possible, an error has occurred.";
  } else if (score >= 0 && score < 20) {
    response = "That was a terrible score — total fail!";
  } else if (score >= 20 && score < 40) {
    response =
      "You know some things, but it's a pretty bad score. Needs improvement.";
  } else if (score >= 40 && score < 70) {
    response = "You did a passable job, not bad!";
  } else if (score >= 70 && score < 90) {
    response = "That's a great score, you really know your stuff.";
  } else if (score >= 90 && score <= 100) {
    response = "What an amazing score! Did you cheat? Are you for real?";
  }
} else {
  response = "The machine is turned off. Turn it on to process your score.";
}

// Don't edit the code below here!
// ...
```

</details>

## Conditionals 3

For the final task you are given four variables:

- `machineActive`: Contains an indicator of whether the login machine is switched on or not (`true`/`false`).
- `pwd`: Contains the user's login password.
- `machineResult`: Begins uninitialized, but is later used to store a response that will be printed to the output panel, letting the user know whether the machine is switched on.
- `pwdResult`: Begins uninitialized, but is later used to store a response that will be printed to the output panel, letting the user know whether their login attempt was successful.

To complete the task:

1. Create an `if...else` structure that checks whether the machine is switched on and puts a message into the `machineResult` variable telling the user whether it is on or off.
2. If the machine is on, we also want a second conditional to run that checks whether the `pwd` is equal to `cheese`. If so, it should assign a string to `pwdResult` telling the user they logged in successfully. If not, it should assign a different string to `pwdResult` telling the user their login attempt was not successful. We'd like you to do this in a single line, using something that isn't an `if...else` structure.

```js live-sample___conditionals-3
let machineActive = true;
let pwd = "cheese";

let machineResult;
let pwdResult;

// Add your code here

// Don't edit the code below here!

const section = document.querySelector("section");
const para1 = document.createElement("p");
const para2 = document.createElement("p");
para1.textContent = machineResult;
para2.textContent = pwdResult;
section.appendChild(para1);
section.appendChild(para2);
```

  pwdResult =
    pwd === "cheese"
      ? "Login successful."
      : "Password incorrect; login failed.";
} else {
  machineResult = "Machine is inactive. Activate and try logging in again.";
}

## DOM manipulation: considered useful

Some of the questions below require you to write some [DOM](/en-US/docs/Glossary/DOM) manipulation code to complete them — such as creating new HTML elements, setting their text contents to equal specific string values, and nesting them inside existing elements on the page — all via JavaScript.

We haven't explicitly taught this yet in the course, but you'll have seen some examples that make use of it, and we'd like you to do some research into what DOM APIs you need to successfully answer the questions. A good starting place is our [DOM scripting introduction](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/DOM_scripting) tutorial.

## Events 1

Our first events-related task involves a {{htmlelement("button")}} that, when clicked, updates its text label. The HTML should not be changed; just the JavaScript.

To complete the task, create an event listener that causes the text inside the button (`btn`) to change when it is clicked on, and change back when it is clicked again.

```css hidden live-sample___events-1
p {
  color: purple;
  margin: 0.5em 0;
}

* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

button {
  display: block;
  margin: 20px 0 20px 20px;
}

canvas {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```

```html hidden live-sample___events-1
<button class="off">Machine is off</button>
```

```js live-sample___events-1
const btn = document.querySelector("button");

// Add your code here
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample("events-1", "100%", 80) }}

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

Your finished JavaScript should look something like this:

```js
const btn = document.querySelector("button");

btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  if (btn.className === "on") {
    btn.textContent = "Machine is off";
    btn.className = "off";
  } else {
    btn.textContent = "Machine is on";
    btn.className = "on";
  }
});
```

</details>

## Events 2

Now we'll look at keyboard events.

To complete this task, create an event listener that moves the circle around the provided canvas when the WASD keys are pressed on the keyboard. The circle is drawn with the function `drawCircle()`, which takes the following parameters as inputs:

- `x` — the x coordinate of the circle.
- `y` — the y coordinate of the circle.
- `size` — the radius of the circle.

> [!WARNING]
> When testing your code, you will have to focus on the canvas before trying out your keyboard commands (for example, click on it, or tab to it with the keyboard). Otherwise they won't work.

```html hidden live-sample___events-2
<canvas width="480" height="320" tabindex="0"> </canvas>
```

```css hidden live-sample___events-2
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

canvas {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```

```js live-sample___events-2
const canvas = document.querySelector("canvas");
const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

function drawCircle(x, y, size) {
  ctx.fillStyle = "white";
  ctx.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.fillStyle = "black";
  ctx.arc(x, y, size, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
  ctx.fill();
}

let x = 50;
let y = 50;
const size = 30;

drawCircle(x, y, size);
// Don't edit the code above here!

// Add your code here
```

window.addEventListener("keydown", (e) => {
  switch (e.key) {

      x -= 5;
      break;
    case "d":
      x += 5;
      break;
    case "w":
      y -= 5;
      break;
    case "s":
      y += 5;
      break;
  }

  drawCircle(x, y, size);
});
```

</details>

## Events 3

In the next events-related task tests your knowledge of event bubbling. We'd like you to set an event listener on the `<button>`s' parent element (`<div class="button-bar"> … </div>`) which, when invoked by clicking any of the buttons, will set the background of the `button-bar` to the color contained in the button's `data-color` attribute.

We want you to solve this without looping through all the buttons and giving each one their own event listener.

```html hidden live-sample___events-3
<div class="button-bar">
  <button data-color="red">Red</button>
  <button data-color="yellow">Yellow</button>
  <button data-color="green">Green</button>
  <button data-color="purple">Purple</button>
</div>
```

```css hidden live-sample___events-3
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

html,
body,
.button-bar {
  height: 100%;
}

.button-bar {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-around;
}

button {
  padding: 5px 10px;
}

## DOM manipulation: considered useful

Some of the questions below require you to write some [DOM](/en-US/docs/Glossary/DOM) manipulation code to complete them — such as creating new HTML elements, setting their text contents to equal specific string values, and nesting them inside existing elements on the page — all via JavaScript.

We haven't explicitly taught this yet in the course, but you'll have seen some examples that make use of it, and we'd like you to do some research into what DOM APIs you need to successfully answer the questions. A good starting place is our [DOM scripting introduction](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/DOM_scripting) tutorial.

## Interactive challenge

First of all, we are giving you a fun, interactive challenge involving function return values, created by our [learning partner](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Learning_content#partner_links_and_embeds), [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/home).

Watch the embedded scrim, and complete the task on the timeline (the little ghost icon) by following the instructions and editing the code. When you are done, you can resume watching the scrim to check how the teacher's solution matches up with yours.

<mdn-scrim-inline url="https://scrimba.com/learn-javascript-c0v/~02h" scrimtitle="Returning values in functions" survey="true"></scrim-inline>

## Task 1

To complete our first functions task:

1. Define a function—`chooseName()`—that prints a random name from the provided array (`names`) into the provided paragraph (`para`).
2. Call the `chooseName()` function once.

<!-- Code shared across examples -->

```html hidden live-sample___functions-1 live-sample___functions-3 live-sample___functions-4
<p></p>
```

```css hidden live-sample___functions-1 live-sample___functions-3 live-sample___functions-4
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

p {
  color: purple;
  margin: 0.5em 0;
}
```

<!-- Example-specific code -->

```js live-sample___functions-1
const names = [
  "Chris",
  "Li Kang",
  "Anne",
  "Francesca",
  "Mustafa",
  "Tina",
  "Bert",
  "Jada",
];
const para = document.querySelector("p");

// Don't edit the code above here!

// Add your code here
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample("functions-1", "100%", 60) }}

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

Your finished JavaScript should look something like this:

```js
// ...
// Don't edit the code above here!

function chooseName() {
  const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * names.length);
  const choice = names[randomNumber];
  para.textContent = choice;
}

chooseName();
```

</details>

## Task 2

This task requires you to create a function that draws a rectangle on the provided `<canvas>` (reference variable `canvas`, context available in `ctx`), based on the five provided input variables:

- `x` — the x coordinate of the rectangle.
- `y` — the y coordinate of the rectangle.
- `width` — the width of the rectangle.
- `height` — the height of the rectangle.
- `color` — the color of the rectangle.

```html hidden live-sample___functions-2
<canvas width="240" height="160"></canvas>
```

```css hidden live-sample___functions-2
canvas {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```

```js live-sample___functions-2
const canvas = document.querySelector("canvas");
const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
const x = 50;
const y = 60;
const width = 100;
const height = 75;
const color = "blue";

// Don't edit the code above here!

// Add your code here
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample("functions-2", "100%", 180) }}

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

Your finished JavaScript should look something like this:

```js
// ...
// Don't edit the code above here!

function drawSquare(x, y, width, height, color) {
  ctx.fillStyle = "white";
  ctx.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
  ctx.fillStyle = color;
  ctx.fillRect(x, y, width, height);
}

drawSquare(x, y, width, height, color);
```

</details>

## Task 3

In this task, you return to the problem posed in Task 1, with the aim of making three improvements to it.

To complete the task:

1. Refactor the code that generates the random number into a separate function called `random()`, which takes as parameters two generic bounds that the random number should be between, and returns the result.
2. Update the `chooseName()` function so that it makes use of the random number function, takes the array to choose from as a parameter (making it more flexible), and returns the result.
3. Print the returned result into the paragraph (`para`)'s `textContent`.

```js live-sample___functions-3
const names = [
  "Chris",
  "Li Kang",
  "Anne",
  "Francesca",
  "Mustafa",
  "Tina",
  "Bert",
  "Jada",
];
const para = document.querySelector("p");

// Don't edit the code above here!

// Update the code below here

function chooseName() {
  const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * names.length);
  const choice = names[randomNumber];
  para.textContent = choice;
}

chooseName();
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample("functions-3", "100%", 60) }}

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

Your finished JavaScript should look something like this:

```js
// ...
// Don't edit the code above here!

function random(min, max) {
  const num = Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min)) + min;
  return num;
}

function chooseItem(array) {
  const choice = array[random(0, array.length)];
  return choice;
}

para.textContent = chooseItem(names);
```

</details>

## Task 4

In this task, we have an array of names, and we're using {{jsxref("Array.filter()")}} to get an array containing only the names shorter than 5 characters. The filter is currently being passed a named function `isShort()`. This checks the length of the name, returning `true` if the name is less than 5 characters long, and `false` otherwise.

To complete the task, update the code so that the functionality inside `isShort()` is instead included directly inside the `filter()` call as an arrow function. See how compact you can make it.

```js live-sample___functions-4
const names = [
  "Chris",
  "Li Kang",
  "Anne",
  "Francesca",
  "Mustafa",
  "Tina",
  "Bert",
  "Jada",
];
const para = document.querySelector("p");

// Don't edit the code above here!

// Update the code below here

function isShort(name) {
  return name.length < 5;
}

const shortNames = names.filter(isShort);
para.textContent = shortNames;
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample("functions-4", "100%", 60) }}

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

Your finished JavaScript should look something like this:

```js
// ...
// Don't edit the code above here!

// Update the code below here

const shortNames = names.filter((name) => name.length < 5);
para.textContent = shortNames;
```

## JSON 1

The one and only task in this article concerns accessing JSON data and using it in your page. JSON data about some mother cats and their kittens is available in [sample.json](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/oojs/tasks/json/sample.json). The JSON is loaded into the page as a text string and made available in the `catString` parameter of the `displayCatInfo()` function.

To complete the task, fill in the missing parts of the `displayCatInfo()` function to store:

- The names of the three mother cats, separated by commas, in the `motherInfo` variable.
- The total number of kittens, and how many are male and female, in the `kittenInfo` variable.

The values of these variables are then printed to the screen inside paragraphs.

Some hints/questions:

- The JSON data is provided as text inside the `displayCatInfo()` function. You'll need to parse it into JSON before you can get any data out of it.
- You'll probably want to use an outer loop to loop through the cats and add their names to the `motherInfo` variable string, and an inner loop to loop through all the kittens, add up the total of all/male/female kittens, and add those details to the `kittenInfo` variable string.
- The last mother cat name should have an "and" before it, and a full stop after it. How do you make sure this can work, no matter how many cats are in the JSON?
- Why are the `para1.textContent = motherInfo;` and `para2.textContent = kittenInfo;` lines inside the `displayCatInfo()` function, and not at the end of the script? This has something to do with async code.

```html hidden live-sample___json-1
<p class="one"></p>
<p class="two"></p>
```

```css hidden live-sample___json-1
p {
  color: purple;
  margin: 0.5em 0;

A good starting place is our [DOM scripting introduction](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/DOM_scripting) tutorial.

## Loops 1

In our first looping task we want you to write a basic loop that iterates through all the items in the provided `myArray` and prints them out on the screen inside list items ([`<li>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/li) elements). They should be appended to the provided `list`.

<!-- Code shared across examples -->

```

```css hidden live-sample___loops-1 live-sample___loops-2 live-sample___loops-3
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

p {
  color: purple;
  margin: 0.5em 0;
}
```

<!-- Example-specific code -->

```js live-sample___loops-1
const myArray = ["tomatoes", "chick peas", "onions", "rice", "black beans"];
const list = document.createElement("ul");
const section = document.querySelector("section");
section.appendChild(list);

// Don't edit the code above here!

// Add your code here
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample("loops-1", "100%", 60) }}

<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

Your finished JavaScript should look something like this:

```js
// ...
// Don't edit the code above here!

for (let item of myArray) {
  const listItem = document.createElement("li");
  listItem.textContent = item;
  list.appendChild(listItem);
}
```

</details>

## Loops 2

In this next task, we want you to write a simple program that, given a name, searches an array of [objects](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Object) containing names and phone numbers and, if it finds the name, outputs the name and phone number into a paragraph.

You are given three variables to begin with:

- `name`: Contains a name to search for.
- `para`: Contains a reference to a paragraph, which will be used to report the results.
- `phonebook`: Contains the phonebook entries to search.

> [!NOTE]
> If you haven't read about objects yet, don't worry! For now, all you need to know is how to access a member-value pair. You can read up on objects in the [JavaScript object basics](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Object_basics) tutorial.

To complete the task:

1. Write a loop that iterates through the (`phonebook`) array and searches for the provided `name`. You should use a type of loop that you've not used in the previous task.
2. If the `name` is found, write it and the associated `number` into the `textContent` of the provided paragraph (`para`), in the form "&lt;name>'s number is &lt;number>." After that, exit the loop before it has run its course.
3. If none of the objects contain the `name`, print "Name not found in the phonebook" into the `textContent` of the provided paragraph.

```js live-sample___loops-2
const name = "Mustafa";
const para = document.createElement("p");

const phonebook = [
  { name: "Chris", number: "1549" },
  { name: "Li Kang", number: "9634" },
  { name: "Anne", number: "9065" },
  { name: "Francesca", number: "3001" },
  { name: "Mustafa", number: "6888" },
  { name: "Tina", number: "4312" },
  { name: "Bert", number: "7780" },
  { name: "Jada", number: "2282" },
];

const section = document.querySelector("section");
section.appendChild(para);

// Don't edit the code above here!

// Add your code here
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample("loops-2", "100%", 60) }}

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

Your finished JavaScript should look something like this:

```js
// ...
// Don't edit the code above here!

for (let i = 0; i < phonebook.length; i++) {
  if (phonebook[i].name === name) {
    para.textContent = `${phonebook[i].name}'s number is ${phonebook[i].number}.`;
    break;
  }

  if (i === phonebook.length - 1) {
    para.textContent = "Name not found in the phonebook";
  }
}
```

</details>

## Loops 3

In this final task, you will test every number from `500` down to `2` to see which ones are prime numbers, using the provided test function, printing out the primes.

You are provided with the following:

- `i`: Starts off with a value of `500`; intended to be used as an iterator.
- `para`: Contains a reference to a paragraph, which will be used to report the results.
- `isPrime()`: A function that, when passed a number, returns `true` if the number is a prime number, and `false` if not.

To complete the task:

1. Write a loop that iterates through every number from `500` down to `2` (1 is not counted as a prime number), and runs the provided `isPrime()` function on each one.
2. For each number that isn't a prime number, continue on to the next loop iteration. For each one that _is_ a prime number, add it to the paragraph's `textContent` along with some kind of separator.

You should use a type of loop that you've not used in the previous two tasks.

```js live-sample___loops-3
let i = 500;
const para = document.createElement("p");
const section = document.querySelector("section");
function isPrime(num) {
  for (let i = 2; i < num; i++) {
    if (num % i === 0) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}
// Don't edit the code above here!

// Add your code here

// Don't edit the code below here!

section.appendChild(para);
```

Your finished JavaScript should look something like this:

```js
// ...
// Don't edit the code above here!

do {
  if (isPrime(i)) {
    para.textContent += `${i}, `;
  }
  i--;
} while (i > 1);

// Don't edit the code below here!
// ...
```

# Test your skills: Math

{{PreviousMenuNext("Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Math", "Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Strings", "Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting")}}

The aim of the tests on this page is to help you assess whether you've understood the [Basic math in JavaScript — numbers and operators](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Math) article.

> [!NOTE]
> To get help, read our [Test your skills](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development#test_your_skills) usage guide. You can also reach out to us using one of our [communication channels](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels).

## Math 1

Let's start out by testing your knowledge of basic math operators.
You will create four numeric values, add two together, subtract one from another, then multiply the results.
Finally, you'll write a test to prove that this value is an even number.

To complete the task:

1. Create four variables that contain numbers. Call the variables something sensible.
2. Add the first two variables together and store the result in another variable.
3. Subtract the fourth variable from the third and store the result in another variable.
4. Multiply the results from steps **2** and **3** and store the result in a variable called `finalResult`.
5. Check if `finalResult` is an even number using one of the [arithmetic operators](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Math#arithmetic_operators). Store the result (`0` for even, `1` for odd) in a variable called `evenOddResult`.

To pass this test, `finalResult` should have a value of `48` and `evenOddResult` should have a value of `0`.

// Don't edit the code below here!

const section = document.querySelector("section");
const para1 = document.createElement("p");
const finalResultCheck =
  finalResult === 48 ? `Yes, well done!` : `No, it is ${finalResult}`;
para1.textContent = `Is the finalResult 48? ${finalResultCheck}`;
const para2 = document.createElement("p");
const evenOddResultCheck =
  evenOddResult === 0
    ? "The final result is even!"
    : "The final result is odd. Hrm.";
para2.textContent = evenOddResultCheck;
section.appendChild(para1);
section.appendChild(para2);
```

<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

Your finished JavaScript should look something like this:

```js
// ...
// Don't edit the code above here!

const number1 = 4;
const number2 = 8;
const number3 = 12;
const number4 = 8;

const additionResult = number1 + number2;
const subtractionResult = number3 - number4;

finalResult = additionResult * subtractionResult;

evenOddResult = finalResult % 2;

// Don't edit the code below here!
// ...
```

</details>

## Math 2

In the second task, you are provided with two calculations with the results stored in the variables `result` and `result2`.
You need to take the calculations, multiply them, and format the result to two decimal places.

To complete the task:

1. Multiply `result` and `result2` and assign the result back to `result` (use assignment shorthand).
2. Format `result` so that it has two decimal places and store it in a variable called `finalResult`.
3. Check the data type of `finalResult` using `typeof`. If it's a `string`, convert it to a `number` type and store the result in a variable called `finalNumber`.

To pass this test, `finalNumber` should have a result of `4633.33`. You might need to consider operator precedence and add or modify some parentheses to the input expressions to get the correct output.

```js live-sample___math-2
// Final result should be 4633.33

let result = 7 + 13 / 9 + 7;
let result2 = (100 / 2) * 6;

// Add your code here

// Don't edit the code below here!

const section = document.querySelector("section");
const para1 = document.createElement("p");
para1.textContent = `Your finalResult is ${finalResult}`;
const para2 = document.createElement("p");
const finalNumberCheck =
  isNaN(finalNumber) === false
    ? "finalNumber is a number type. Well done!"
    : `Oops! finalNumber is not a number.`;
para2.textContent = finalNumberCheck;
section.appendChild(para1);
section.appendChild(para2);
```

result *= result2;

const finalResult = result.toFixed(2);

const finalNumber = Number(finalResult);

// Don't edit the code below here!
// ...
```

</details>

## Math 3

In the final task for this article, we want you to write some tests.

To complete the task:

1. There are three groups, each consisting of a statement and two variables. For each one, write a test that proves or disproves the statement made.
2. Store the results of those tests in variables called `weightComparison`, `heightComparison`, and `pwdMatch`, respectively.

```js live-sample___math-3
// Statement 1: The elephant weighs less than the mouse
const eleWeight = 1000;
const mouseWeight = 2;
// Statement 2: The Ostrich is taller than the duck
const ostrichHeight = 2;
const duckHeight = 0.3;
// Statement 3: The two passwords match
const pwd1 = "stromboli";
const pwd2 = "stROmBoLi";

// Don't edit the code above here!

// Add your code here

// Don't edit the code below here!

const section = document.querySelector("section");
const para1 = document.createElement("p");
const para2 = document.createElement("p");
const para3 = document.createElement("p");
const weightTest = weightComparison
  ? "True — elephants do weigh less than mice!?"
  : "False — of course an elephant is heavier than a mouse!";
const heightTest = heightComparison
  ? "True — an ostrich is indeed taller than a duck!"
  : "False — apparently a duck is taller than an ostrich!?";
const pwdTest = pwdMatch
  ? "True — the passwords match."
  : "False — the passwords do not match; please check them";
para1.textContent = weightTest;
section.appendChild(para1);
para2.textContent = heightTest;
section.appendChild(para2);
para3.textContent = pwdTest;
section.appendChild(para3);
```

const heightComparison = ostrichHeight > duckHeight;
const pwdMatch = pwd1 === pwd2;

// Don't edit the code below here!
// ...
```

## Object basics 1

In this task you are provided with an object literal, and we want you to do some work on it.

To complete the task:

1. Store the value of the `name` property inside the `catName` variable, using bracket notation.
2. Run the `greeting()` method using dot notation (it will log the greeting to the console).
3. Update the `color` property value to `black`.

  color: "white",
  greeting: function () {
    console.log("Meow!");
  },
};

para2.textContent = `The cat's color is ${cat.color}.`;
section.appendChild(para1);
section.appendChild(para2);
```

// Don't edit the code below here!
// ...
```

</details>

## Object basics 2

In our next task, we want you to have a go at creating your own object literal to represent one of your favorite bands.

To complete the task:

1. Create an object literal called `band`, which contains the following properties:
   - `name`: A string representing the band name.
   - `nationality`: A string representing the country the band comes from.
   - `genre`: What type of music the band plays.
   - `members`: A number representing the number of members the band has.
   - `formed`: A number representing the year the band formed.
   - `split`: A number representing the year the band split up, or `false` if they are still together.
   - `albums`: An array representing the albums released by the band. Each array item should be an object containing the following members:
     - `name`: A string representing the name of the album.
     - `released`: A number representing the year the album was released.
       > [!NOTE]
       > Include at least two albums in the `albums` array.
2. Write a string to the variable `bandInfo`, which will contain a small biography detailing their name, nationality, years active, and style, and the title and release date of their first album.

```js live-sample___objects-2
let bandInfo;

// Don't edit the code above here!

// Add your code here

// Don't edit the code below here!

const section = document.querySelector("section");
let para1 = document.createElement("p");
para1.textContent = bandInfo;
section.appendChild(para1);
```

const band = {
  name: "Black Sabbath",
  nationality: "British",
  genre: "heavy metal",
  members: 4,
  formed: 1968,
  split: 2025,
  albums: [
    {
      name: "Black Sabbath",
      released: 1970,
    },
    {
      name: "Paranoid",
      released: 1970,
    },
    {
      name: "Master of Reality",
      released: 1971,
    },
    {
      name: "Vol. 4",
      released: 1972,
    },
  ],
};

bandInfo = `The ${band.nationality} ${band.genre} band ${band.name} were active between ${band.formed} and ${band.split}. Their first album, ${band.albums[0].name}, was released in ${band.albums[0].released}.`;

// Don't edit the code below here!
// ...
```

</details>

## Object basics 3

In this task, we want you to return to the `cat` object literal from Object basics 1.

To complete the task:

1. Rewrite the `greeting()` method so that it logs `"Hello, said Bertie the Cymric."` to the browser's console, but in a way that will work across _any_ cat object of the same structure, regardless of its name or breed.
2. Write your own object called `cat2`, which has the same structure and `greeting()` method, but a different `name`, `breed`, and `color`.
3. Call both `greeting()` methods to check that they log appropriate greetings to the console.

```js live-sample___objects-3
const cat = {
  name: "Bertie",
  breed: "Cymric",
  color: "white",
  greeting: function () {
    console.log("Meow!");
  },
};

// Don't edit the code above here!

// Add your code here
```

Your finished JavaScript should look something like this:

```js
// ...
// Don't edit the code above here!

const cat2 = {
  name: "Elfie",
  breed: "Aphrodite Giant",
  color: "ginger",
  greeting: function () {
    console.log(`Hello, said ${this.name} the ${this.breed}.`);
  },
};

cat.greeting();
cat2.greeting();
```

</details>

## Object basics 4

In the code you wrote for Task 3, the `greeting()` method and properties are defined twice, once for each cat. This isn't ideal: specifically, it violates a principle in programming called [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) or "Don't Repeat Yourself". In this task we want you to improve the code so the object members are only defined once.

To complete the task:

1. Create a JavaScript class that defines cat instances
2. Use your class along with the `new` keyword to create the `cat` and `cat2` instances.

```js live-sample___objects-4
const cat = {
  name: "Bertie",
  breed: "Cymric",
  color: "white",
  greeting: function () {
    console.log(`Hello, said ${this.name} the ${this.breed}.`);
  },
};

const cat2 = {
  name: "Elfie",
  breed: "Aphrodite Giant",
  color: "ginger",
  greeting: function () {
    console.log(`Hello, said ${this.name} the ${this.breed}.`);
  },
};

// Don't edit the code below here!

cat.greeting();
cat2.greeting();
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample("objects-4", "100%", 60) }}

<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

Your finished JavaScript should look something like this:

```js
class Cat {
  constructor(name, breed, color) {
    this.name = name;
    this.breed = breed;
    this.color = color;
  }
  greeting() {
    console.log(`Hello, said ${this.name} the ${this.breed}.`);
  }
}

const cat = new Cat("Bertie", "Cymric", "white");
const cat2 = new Cat("Elfie", "Aphrodite Giant", "ginger");

// Don't edit the code below here!

## Strings 1

In our first strings task, we start off small. You already have half of a famous quote inside a variable called `quoteStart`, and we want you to complete it.

To complete the task:

1. Look up the other half of the quote, and add it to the example inside a variable called `quoteEnd`.
2. Concatenate the two strings together to make a single string containing the complete quote. Save the result inside a variable called `finalQuote`.
3. You'll find that you get an error at this point. Can you fix the problem with `quoteStart`, so that the full quote displays correctly?

}
```

<!-- Example-specific code -->

const quoteStart = 'Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap ';

// Add your code here

// Don't edit the code below here!

const section = document.querySelector("section");
const para1 = document.createElement("p");
para1.textContent = finalQuote;
section.appendChild(para1);
```

Your finished JavaScript should look something like this:

```js-nolint
// You need to escape the quote
const quoteStart = 'Don\'t judge each day by the harvest you reap ';

const quoteEnd = "but by the seeds that you plant.";

const finalQuote = `${quoteStart}${quoteEnd}`;

// Don't edit the code below here!
// ...
```

</details>

## Strings 2

In this task you are provided with two variables, `quote` and `substring`, which contain two strings.

To complete the task:

1. Retrieve the length of the quote, and store it in a variable called `quoteLength`.
2. Find the index position where `substring` appears in `quote`, and store that value in a variable called `index`.
3. Use a combination of the variables you have and available string properties/methods to trim down the original quote to "I do not like green eggs and ham.", and store it in a variable called `revisedQuote`.

```js live-sample___strings-2
const quote = "I do not like green eggs and ham. I do not like them, Sam-I-Am.";
const substring = "green eggs and ham";

// Don't edit the code above here!

// Add your code here

// Don't edit the code below here!

const section = document.querySelector("section");
section.innerHTML = " ";
const para1 = document.createElement("p");
para1.textContent = `The quote is ${quoteLength} characters long.`;
const para2 = document.createElement("p");
para2.textContent = revisedQuote;
section.appendChild(para1);
section.appendChild(para2);
```

Your finished JavaScript should look something like this:

```js
// ...
// Don't edit the code above here!

const quoteLength = quote.length;
const index = quote.indexOf(substring);
const revisedQuote = quote.slice(0, index + substring.length + 1);

// Don't edit the code below here!
// ...
```

</details>

## Strings 3

In the next string task, you are given the same quote that you ended up with in the previous task, but it is somewhat broken! We want you to fix and update it.

To complete the task:

1. Change the casing to correct sentence case (all lowercase, except for upper case first letter). Store the new quote in a variable called `fixedQuote`.
2. In `fixedQuote`, replace "green eggs and ham" with another food that you really don't like.
3. There is one more small fix to do — add a period to the end of the quote, and save the final version in a variable called `finalQuote`.

```js live-sample___strings-3
const quote = "I dO nOT lIke gREen eGgS anD HAM";

// Don't edit the code above here!

// Add your code here

// Don't edit the code below here!

const section = document.querySelector("section");
const para1 = document.createElement("p");
para1.textContent = finalQuote;
section.appendChild(para1);
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample("strings-3", "100%", 60) }}

<details>

Your finished JavaScript should look something like this:

```js
// ...
// Don't edit the code above here!

let fixedQuote = quote.toLowerCase();
const firstLetter = fixedQuote.slice(0, 1);
fixedQuote = fixedQuote.replace(firstLetter, firstLetter.toUpperCase());
fixedQuote = fixedQuote.replace("green eggs and ham", "pickled onions");
const finalQuote = `${fixedQuote}.`;

// Don't edit the code below here!
// ...
```

</details>

## Strings 4

In the final string task, we have given you the name of a theorem, two numeric values, and an incomplete string (the bits that need adding are marked with asterisks (`*`)). We want you to change the value of the string.

To complete the task:

1. Change the string from a regular string literal into a template literal.
2. Replace the four asterisks with four template literal embedded expressions. These should be:
   1. The name of the theorem.
   2. The two number values we have.
   3. The length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, assuming the two other side lengths are the same as the two values we have. You'll need to look up how to calculate this from what you have. Do the calculation inside the placeholder.

```js live-sample___strings-4
const theorem = "Pythagorean theorem";

const a = 5;
const b = 8;

// Don't edit the code above here!

// Edit the string literal
const myString =
  "Using *, we can work out that if the two shortest sides of a right-angled triangle have lengths of * and *, the length of the hypotenuse is *.";

// Don't edit the code below here!

const section = document.querySelector("section");
const para1 = document.createElement("p");
para1.textContent = myString;
section.appendChild(para1);
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample("strings-4", "100%", 60) }}

<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

Your finished JavaScript should look something like this:

```js
// ...
// Don't edit the code above here!

const myString = `Using ${theorem}, we can work out that if the two shortest sides of a right-angled triangle have lengths of ${a} and ${b},
  the length of the hypotenuse is ${Math.sqrt(a ** 2 + b ** 2)}.`;

// Don't edit the code below here!
// ...

# Useful string methods

Now that we've looked at the very basics of strings, let's move up a gear and start thinking about what useful operations we can do on strings with built-in methods, such as finding the length of a text string, joining and splitting strings, substituting one character in a string for another, and more.

## Strings as objects

Most values can be used as if they are objects in JavaScript. When you create a string, for example by using

```js
const string = "This is my string";
```

although the variable itself isn't an object, it still has a large number of properties and methods available to it, by virtue of being usable as an object when accessing properties. You can see this if you go to the {{jsxref("String")}} object page and look down the list on the side of the page!

**Now, before your brain starts melting, don't worry!** You really don't need to know about most of these early on in your learning journey. But there are a few that you'll potentially use quite often that we'll look at here.

Let's enter some examples into the [browser developer console](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools).

## Finding the length of a string

This is easy — you use the {{jsxref("String.prototype.length", "length")}} property. Try entering the following lines:

```js
const browserType = "mozilla";
browserType.length;
```

This should return the number 7, because "mozilla" is 7 characters long. This is useful for many reasons; for example, you might want to find the lengths of a series of names so you can display them in order of length, or let a user know that a username they have entered into a form field is too long if it is over a certain length.

## Retrieving a specific string character

On a related note, you can return any character inside a string by using **square bracket notation** — this means you include square brackets (`[]`) on the end of your variable name. Inside the square brackets, you include the number of the character you want to return, so for example to retrieve the first letter you'd do this:

```js
browserType[0];
```

Remember: computers count from 0, not 1!

To retrieve the last character of _any_ string, we could use the following line, combining this technique with the `length` property we looked at above:

```js
browserType[browserType.length - 1];
```

The length of the string "mozilla" is 7, but because the count starts at 0, the last character's position is 6; using `length-1` gets us the last character.

## Testing if a string contains a substring

Sometimes you'll want to find if a smaller string is present inside a larger one (we generally say _if a substring is present inside a string_). This can be done using the {{jsxref("String.prototype.includes()", "includes()")}} method, which takes a single {{glossary("parameter")}} — the substring you want to search for.

It returns `true` if the string contains the substring, and `false` otherwise.

```js
const browserType = "mozilla";

if (browserType.includes("zilla")) {
  console.log("Found zilla!");
} else {
  console.log("No zilla here!");
}
```

Often you'll want to know if a string starts or ends with a particular substring. This is a common enough need that there are two special methods for this: {{jsxref("String.prototype.startsWith()", "startsWith()")}} and {{jsxref("String.prototype.endsWith()", "endsWith()")}}:

```js
const browserType = "mozilla";

if (browserType.startsWith("zilla")) {
  console.log("Found zilla!");
} else {
  console.log("No zilla here!");
}
```

```js
const browserType = "mozilla";

if (browserType.endsWith("zilla")) {
  console.log("Found zilla!");
} else {
  console.log("No zilla here!");
}
```

## Finding the position of a substring in a string

You can find the position of a substring inside a larger string using the {{jsxref("String.prototype.indexOf()", "indexOf()")}} method. This method takes two {{glossary("parameter", "parameters")}} – the substring that you want to search for, and an optional parameter that specifies the starting point of the search.

If the string contains the substring, `indexOf()` returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring. If the string does not contain the substring, `indexOf()` returns `-1`.

```js
const tagline = "MDN - Resources for developers, by developers";
console.log(tagline.indexOf("developers")); // 20
```

Starting at `0`, if you count the number of characters (including the whitespace) from the beginning of the string, the first occurrence of the substring `"developers"` is at index `20`.

```js
console.log(tagline.indexOf("x")); // -1
```

This, on the other hand, returns `-1` because the character `x` is not present in the string.

So now that you know how to find the first occurrence of a substring, how do you go about finding subsequent occurrences? You can do that by passing in a value that's greater than the index of the previous occurrence as the second parameter to the method.

```js
const firstOccurrence = tagline.indexOf("developers");
const secondOccurrence = tagline.indexOf("developers", firstOccurrence + 1);

console.log(firstOccurrence); // 20
console.log(secondOccurrence); // 35
```

Here we're telling the method to search for the substring `"developers"` starting at index `21` (`firstOccurrence + 1`), and it returns the index `35`.

## Extracting a substring from a string

You can extract a substring from a string using the {{jsxref("String.prototype.slice()", "slice()")}} method. You pass it:

- the index at which to start extracting
- the index at which to stop extracting. This is exclusive, meaning that the character at this index is not included in the extracted substring.

For example:

```js
const browserType = "mozilla";
console.log(browserType.slice(1, 4)); // "ozi"
```

The character at index `1` is `"o"`, and the character at index 4 is `"l"`. So we extract all characters starting at `"o"` and ending just before `"l"`, giving us `"ozi"`.

If you know that you want to extract all of the remaining characters in a string after a certain character, you don't have to include the second parameter. Instead, you only need to include the character position from where you want to extract the remaining characters in a string. Try the following:

```js
browserType.slice(2); // "zilla"
```

This returns `"zilla"` — this is because the character position of 2 is the letter `"z"`, and because you didn't include a second parameter, the substring that was returned was all of the remaining characters in the string.

> [!NOTE]
> `slice()` has other options too; study the {{jsxref("String.prototype.slice()", "slice()")}} page to see what else you can find out.

## Changing case

The string methods {{jsxref("String.prototype.toLowerCase()", "toLowerCase()")}} and {{jsxref("String.prototype.toUpperCase()", "toUpperCase()")}} take a string and convert all the characters to lower- or uppercase, respectively. This can be useful for example if you want to normalize all user-entered data before storing it in a database.

Let's try entering the following lines to see what happens:

```js
const radData = "My NaMe Is MuD";
console.log(radData.toLowerCase());
console.log(radData.toUpperCase());
```

## Updating parts of a string

You can replace one substring inside a string with another substring using the {{jsxref("String.prototype.replace()", "replace()")}} method.

In this example, we're providing two parameters — the string we want to replace, and the string we want to replace it with:

```js
const browserType = "mozilla";
const updated = browserType.replace("moz", "van");

console.log(updated); // "vanilla"
console.log(browserType); // "mozilla"
```

Note that `replace()`, like many string methods, doesn't change the string it was called on, but returns a new string. If you want to update the original `browserType` variable, you would have to do something like this:

```js
let browserType = "mozilla";
browserType = browserType.replace("moz", "van");

console.log(browserType); // "vanilla"
```

Also note that we now have to declare `browserType` using `let`, not `const`, because we are reassigning it.

Be aware that `replace()` in this form only changes the first occurrence of the substring. If you want to change all occurrences, you can use {{jsxref("String.prototype.replaceAll()", "replaceAll()")}}:

```js
let quote = "To be or not to be";
quote = quote.replaceAll("be", "code");

console.log(quote); // "To code or not to code"
```

## Learning challenges

In this section, we'll get you to try your hand at writing some string manipulation code. In each exercise below, we have an array of strings, and a loop that processes each value in the array and displays it in a bulleted list. You don't need to understand arrays or loops right now — these will be explained in future articles. All you need to do in each case is write the code that will output the strings in the format that we want them in.

Open each example inside the MDN Playground using the **"Play"** button at the top of the live example, then follow the instructions to solve the problem. If you get stuck, you can view the solutions below the live example in each case.

You can use the "Reset" button in the MDN Playground to reset the code if you make a mistake and can't get it working again.

### Filtering greeting messages

In the first exercise, we'll start you off simple — we have an array of greeting card messages, but we want to sort them to list just the Christmas messages. We want you to fill in a conditional test inside the `if ()` structure to test each string and only print it in the list if it is a Christmas message.

Think about how you could test whether the message in each case is a Christmas message. What string is present in all of those messages, and what method could you use to test whether it is present?

```html hidden live-sample___string-methods-1
<ul></ul>
```

```js live-sample___string-methods-1
const list = document.querySelector("ul");
const greetings = [
  "Happy Birthday!",
  "Merry Christmas my love",
  "A happy Christmas to all the family",
  "You're all I want for Christmas",
  "Get well soon",
];

for (const greeting of greetings) {
  // Your conditional test needs to go inside the parentheses
  // in the line below, replacing what's currently there
  if (greeting) {
    const listItem = document.createElement("li");
    listItem.textContent = greeting;
    list.appendChild(listItem);
  }
}
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample("string-methods-1", "100%", 150) }}

Your finished JavaScript should look like this:

```js
const list = document.querySelector("ul");
const greetings = [
  "Happy Birthday!",
  "Merry Christmas my love",
  "A happy Christmas to all the family",
  "You're all I want for Christmas",
  "Get well soon",
];

for (const greeting of greetings) {
  if (greeting.includes("Christmas")) {
    const listItem = document.createElement("li");
    listItem.textContent = greeting;
    list.appendChild(listItem);
  }
}
```

</details>

### Fixing capitalization

This exercise features the names of cities in the United Kingdom, but the capitalization is all messed up. We want you to change them so that they are all lowercase, except for a capital first letter. A good way to do this is to:

1. Convert the whole of the string contained in the `city` variable to lowercase and store it in a new variable.
2. Grab the first letter of the string in this new variable and store it in another variable.
3. Using this latest variable as a substring, replace the first letter of the lowercase string with the first letter of the lowercase string changed to upper case. Store the result of this replacement procedure in another new variable.
4. Change the value of the `result` variable to equal to the final result, not the `city`.

> [!NOTE]
> A hint — the parameters of the string methods don't have to be string literals; they can also be variables, or even variables with a method being called on them.

```html hidden live-sample___string-methods-2
<ul></ul>
```

```js live-sample___string-methods-2
const list = document.querySelector("ul");
const cities = ["lonDon", "ManCHESTer", "BiRmiNGHAM", "liVERpoOL"];

for (const city of cities) {
  // write your code just below here

  const result = city;
  const listItem = document.createElement("li");
  listItem.textContent = result;
  list.appendChild(listItem);
}
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample("string-methods-2", "100%", 150) }}

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

Your finished JavaScript should look like this:

```js
const list = document.querySelector("ul");
const cities = ["lonDon", "ManCHESTer", "BiRmiNGHAM", "liVERpoOL"];

for (const city of cities) {
  const lower = city.toLowerCase();
  const firstLetter = lower.slice(0, 1);
  const capitalized = lower.replace(firstLetter, firstLetter.toUpperCase());
  const result = capitalized;
  const listItem = document.createElement("li");
  listItem.textContent = result;
  list.appendChild(listItem);
}
```

</details>

### Making new strings from old parts

In this last exercise, the array contains strings of information about train stations in the North of England. The strings are data items that contain the three-letter station code, followed by some machine-readable data, followed by a semicolon, followed by the human-readable station name. For example:

```plain
MAN675847583748sjt567654;Manchester Piccadilly
```

We want to extract the station code and name, and put them together in a string with the following structure:

```plain
MAN: Manchester Piccadilly
```

We'd recommend doing it like this:

1. Extract the three-letter station code and store it in a new variable.
2. Find the character index number of the semicolon.
3. Extract the human-readable station name using the semicolon character index number as a reference point, and store it in a new variable.
4. Concatenate the two new variables and a string literal to make the final string.
5. Change the value of the `result` variable to the final string, not the `station`.

```html hidden live-sample___string-methods-3
<ul></ul>
```

```js live-sample___string-methods-3
const list = document.querySelector("ul");
const stations = [
  "MAN675847583748sjt567654;Manchester Piccadilly",
  "GNF576746573fhdg4737dh4;Greenfield",
  "LIV5hg65hd737456236dch46dg4;Liverpool Lime Street",
  "SYB4f65hf75f736463;Stalybridge",
  "HUD5767ghtyfyr4536dh45dg45dg3;Huddersfield",
];

for (const station of stations) {
  // write your code just below here

  const result = station;
  const listItem = document.createElement("li");
  listItem.textContent = result;
  list.appendChild(listItem);
}
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample("string-methods-3", "100%", 150) }}

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

Your finished JavaScript should look like this:

```js
const list = document.querySelector("ul");
const stations = [
  "MAN675847583748sjt567654;Manchester Piccadilly",
  "GNF576746573fhdg4737dh4;Greenfield",
  "LIV5hg65hd737456236dch46dg4;Liverpool Lime Street",
  "SYB4f65hf75f736463;Stalybridge",
  "HUD5767ghtyfyr4536dh45dg45dg3;Huddersfield",
];

for (const station of stations) {
  const code = station.slice(0, 3);
  const semiColon = station.indexOf(";");
  const name = station.slice(semiColon + 1);
  const result = `${code}: ${name}`;
  const listItem = document.createElement("li");
  listItem.textContent = result;
  list.appendChild(listItem);
}
```

## Summary

You can't escape the fact that being able to handle words and sentences in programming is very important — particularly in JavaScript, as websites are all about communicating with people. This article has given you the basics that you need to know about manipulating strings for now. This should serve you well as you go into more complex topics in the future.

In the next article, we'll give you some tests that you can use to check how well you've understood and retained the information we've provided about strings and string methods.

After reading the last couple of articles you should now know what JavaScript is, what it can do for you, how you use it alongside other web technologies, and what its main features look like from a high level. In this article, we will get down to the real basics, looking at how to work with the most basic building blocks of JavaScript — Variables.

## Tools you need

Throughout this article, you'll be asked to type in lines of code to test your understanding of the content. If you are using a desktop browser, the best place to type your sample code is your browser's JavaScript console (see [What are browser developer tools](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools) for more information on how to access this tool).

## What is a variable?

A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a sentence.

### Variable example

Let's look at an example:

```html
<button id="button_A">Press me</button>
<h3 id="heading_A"></h3>
```

```js
const buttonA = document.querySelector("#button_A");
const headingA = document.querySelector("#heading_A");

let count = 1;

buttonA.onclick = () => {
  buttonA.textContent = "Try again!";
  headingA.textContent = `${count} clicks so far`;
  count += 1;
};
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Variable_example', '100%', 120) }}

In this example pressing the button runs some code. First, it changes the text on the button itself. Second, it shows a message of the number of times the button has been pressed. The number is stored in a variable. Each time the user presses the button, the number in the variable will increment by one.

### Without a variable

To understand why this is so useful, let's think about how we'd write this example without using a variable to store the count. It would end up looking something like this:

```html example-bad
<button id="button_B">Press me</button>
<h3 id="heading_B"></h3>
```

```js example-bad
const buttonB = document.querySelector("#button_B");
const headingB = document.querySelector("#heading_B");

buttonB.onclick = () => {
  buttonB.textContent = "Try again!";
  headingB.textContent = "1 click so far";
};
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Without_a_variable', '100%', 120) }}

You may not fully understand the syntax we are using (yet!), but you should be able to get the idea. Without a variable, we don't have a way of knowing how many times the button has been clicked. The message to the user will quickly be irrelevant when no information can be remembered.

Variables just make sense, and as you learn more about JavaScript they will start to become second nature.

One special thing about variables is that they can contain just about anything — not just strings and numbers. Variables can also contain complex data and even entire functions to do amazing things. You'll learn more about this as you go along.

> [!NOTE]
> We say variables contain values. This is an important distinction to make. Variables aren't the values themselves; they are containers for values. You can think of them being like little cardboard boxes that you can store things in.

![A screenshot of three 3-dimensional cardboard boxes demonstrating examples of JavaScript variables. Each box contains hypothetical values that represent various JavaScript data types. The sample values are "Bob", true and 35 respectively.](boxes.png)

## Declaring a variable

To use a variable, you've first got to create it — more accurately, we call this declaring the variable. To do this, we type the keyword `let` followed by the name you want to call your variable:

```js
let myName;
let myAge;
```

Here we're creating two variables called `myName` and `myAge`. Try typing these lines into your web browser's console. After that, try creating a variable (or two) with your own name choices.

> [!NOTE]
> In JavaScript, all code instructions should end with a semicolon (`;`) — your code may work correctly for single lines, but probably won't when you are writing multiple lines of code together. Try to get into the habit of including it.

You can test whether these values now exist in the execution environment by typing just the variable's name, e.g.

```js
myName;
myAge;
```

They currently have no value; they are empty containers. When you enter the variable names, you should get a value of `undefined` returned. If they don't exist, you'll get an error message — try typing in

```js
scoobyDoo;
```

> [!NOTE]
> Don't confuse a variable that exists but has no defined value with a variable that doesn't exist at all — they are very different things. In the box analogy you saw above, not existing would mean there's no box (variable) for a value to go in. No value defined would mean that there is a box, but it has no value inside it.

## Initializing a variable

Once you've declared a variable, you can initialize it with a value. You do this by typing the variable name, followed by an equals sign (`=`), followed by the value you want to give it. For example:

```js
myName = "Chris";
myAge = 37;
```

Try going back to the console now and typing in these lines. You should see the value you've assigned to the variable returned in the console to confirm it, in each case. Again, you can return your variable values by typing their name into the console — try these again:

```js
myName;
myAge;
```

You can declare and initialize a variable at the same time, like this:

```js
let myDog = "Rover";
```

This is probably what you'll do most of the time, as it is quicker than doing the two actions on two separate lines.

## A note about var

You'll probably also see a different way to declare variables, using the `var` keyword:

```js
var myName;
var myAge;
```

Back when JavaScript was first created, this was the only way to declare variables. The design of `var` is confusing and error-prone. So `let` was created in modern versions of JavaScript, a new keyword for creating variables that works somewhat differently to `var`, fixing its issues in the process.

A couple of simple differences are explained below. We won't go into all the differences now, but you'll start to discover them as you learn more about JavaScript (if you really want to read about them now, feel free to check out our [let reference page](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let)).

For a start, if you write a multiline JavaScript program that declares and initializes a variable, you can actually declare a variable with `var` after you initialize it and it will still work. For example:

```js
myName = "Chris";

function logName() {
  console.log(myName);
}

logName();

var myName;
```

> [!NOTE]
> This won't work when typing individual lines into a JavaScript console, just when running multiple lines of JavaScript in a web document.

This works because of **hoisting** — read [var hoisting](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var#hoisting) for more detail on the subject.

Hoisting no longer works with `let`. If we changed `var` to `let` in the above example, it would fail with an error. This is a good thing — declaring a variable after you initialize it results in confusing, harder to understand code.

Secondly, when you use `var`, you can declare the same variable as many times as you like, but with `let` you can't. The following would work:

```js
var myName = "Chris";
var myName = "Bob";
```

But the following would throw an error on the second line:

```js example-bad
let myName = "Chris";
let myName = "Bob";
```

You'd have to do this instead:

```js
let myName = "Chris";
myName = "Bob";
```

Again, this is a sensible language decision. There is no reason to redeclare variables — it just makes things more confusing.

For these reasons and more, we recommend that you use `let` in your code, rather than `var`. Unless you are explicitly writing support for ancient browsers, there is no longer any reason to use `var` as all modern browsers have supported `let` since 2015.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are trying this code in your browser's console, prefer to copy & paste each of the code blocks here as a whole. There's a [feature in Chrome's console](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NP_FnHr4WCZRp7exgUklvNiXrH3nujcfwvp2pzMQ8-0/edit#heading=h.7y5hynxk52e9) where variable re-declarations with `let` and `const` are allowed:
>
> ```plain
> > let myName = "Chris";
>   let myName = "Bob";
> // As one input: SyntaxError: Identifier 'myName' has already been declared
>
> > let myName = "Chris";
> > let myName = "Bob";
> // As two inputs: both succeed
> ```

## Updating a variable

Once a variable has been initialized with a value, you can change (or update) that value by giving it a different value. Try entering the following lines into your console:

```js
myName = "Bob";
myAge = 40;
```

### An aside on variable naming rules

You can call a variable pretty much anything you like, but there are limitations. Generally, you should stick to just using Latin characters (0-9, a-z, A-Z) and the underscore character.

- You shouldn't use other characters because they may cause errors or be hard to understand for an international audience.
- Don't use underscores at the start of variable names — this is used in certain JavaScript constructs to mean specific things, so may get confusing.
- Don't use numbers at the start of variables. This isn't allowed and causes an error.
- A safe convention to stick to is {{Glossary("camel_case", "lower camel case")}}, where you stick together multiple words, using lower case for the whole first word and then capitalize subsequent words. We've been using this for our variable names in the article so far.
- Make variable names intuitive, so they describe the data they contain. Don't just use single letters/numbers, or big long phrases.
- Variables are case sensitive — so `myage` is a different variable from `myAge`.
- One last point: you also need to avoid using JavaScript reserved words as your variable names — by this, we mean the words that make up the actual syntax of JavaScript! So, you can't use words like `var`, `function`, `let`, and `for` as variable names. Browsers recognize them as different code items, and so you'll get errors.

> [!NOTE]
> You can find a fairly complete list of reserved keywords to avoid at [Lexical grammar — keywords](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#keywords).

Good name examples:

```plain example-good
age
myAge
init
initialColor
finalOutputValue
audio1
audio2
```

Bad name examples:

```plain example-bad
1
a
_12
myage
MYAGE
var
Document
skjfndskjfnbdskjfb
thisisareallylongvariablenameman
```

Try creating a few more variables now, with the above guidance in mind.

## Variable types

There are a few different types of data we can store in variables. In this section we'll describe these in brief, then in future articles, you'll learn about them in more detail.

### Numbers

You can store numbers in variables, either whole numbers like 30 (also called integers) or decimal numbers like 2.456 (also called floats or floating point numbers). You don't need to declare variable types in JavaScript, unlike some other programming languages. When you give a variable a number value, you don't include quotes:

```js
let myAge = 17;
```

### Strings

Strings are pieces of text. When you give a variable a string value, you need to wrap it in single or double quote marks; otherwise, JavaScript tries to interpret it as another variable name.

```js
let dolphinGoodbye = "So long and thanks for all the fish";
```

### Booleans

Booleans are true/false values — they can have two values, `true` or `false`. These are generally used to test a condition, after which code is run as appropriate. So for example, a simple case would be:

```js
let iAmAlive = true;
```

Whereas in reality it would be used more like this:

```js
let test = 6 < 3;
```

This is using the "less than" operator (`<`) to test whether 6 is less than 3. As you might expect, it returns `false`, because 6 is not less than 3! You will learn a lot more about such operators later on in the course.

### Arrays

An array is a single object that contains multiple values enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas. Try entering the following lines into your console:

```js
let myNameArray = ["Chris", "Bob", "Jim"];
let myNumberArray = [10, 15, 40];
```

Once these arrays are defined, you can access each value by their location within the array. Try these lines:

```js
myNameArray[0]; // should return 'Chris'
myNumberArray[2]; // should return 40
```

The square brackets specify an index value corresponding to the position of the value you want returned. You might have noticed that arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed: the first element is at index 0.

### Objects

In programming, an object is a structure of code that models a real-life object. You can have an object that represents a box and contains information about its width, length, and height, or you could have an object that represents a person, and contains data about their name, height, weight, what language they speak, how to say hello to them, and more.

Try entering the following line into your console:

```js
let dog = { name: "Spot", breed: "Dalmatian" };
```

To retrieve the information stored in the object, you can use the following syntax:

```js
dog.name;
```

## Dynamic typing

JavaScript is a "dynamically typed language", which means that, unlike some other languages, you don't need to specify what data type a variable will contain (numbers, strings, arrays, etc.).

For example, if you declare a variable and give it a value enclosed in quotes, the browser treats the variable as a string:

```js
let myString = "Hello";
```

Even if the value enclosed in quotes is just digits, it is still a string — not a number — so be careful:

```js
let myNumber = "500"; // oops, this is still a string
typeof myNumber;
myNumber = 500; // much better — now this is a number
typeof myNumber;
```

Try entering the four lines above into your console one by one, and see what the results are. You'll notice that we are using a special operator called [`typeof`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof) — this returns the data type of the variable you type after it. The first time it is called, it should return `string`, as at that point the `myNumber` variable contains a string, `'500'`. Have a look and see what it returns the second time you call it.

## Constants in JavaScript

As well as variables, you can declare constants. These are like variables, except that:

- you must initialize them when you declare them.
- you can't assign them a new value after you've initialized them.

For example, using `let` you can declare a variable without initializing it:

```js
let count;
```

If you try to do this using `const` you will see an error:

```js example-bad
const count;
```

Similarly, with `let` you can initialize a variable, and then assign it a new value (this is also called _reassigning_ the variable):

```js
let count = 1;
count = 2;
```

If you try to do this using `const` you will see an error:

```js example-bad
const count = 1;
count = 2;
```

Note that although a constant in JavaScript must always name the same value, you can change the content of the value that it names. This isn't a useful distinction for simple types like numbers or booleans, but consider an object:

```js
const bird = { species: "Kestrel" };
console.log(bird.species); // "Kestrel"
```

You can update, add, or remove properties of an object declared using `const`, because even though the content of the object has changed, the constant is still pointing to the same object:

```js
bird.species = "Striated Caracara";
console.log(bird.species); // "Striated Caracara"
```

## When to use const and when to use let

If you can't do as much with `const` as you can with `let`, why would you prefer to use it rather than `let`? In fact `const` is very useful. If you use `const` to name a value, it tells anyone looking at your code that this name will never be assigned to a different value. Any time they see this name, they will know what it refers to.

In this course, we adopt the following principle about when to use `let` and when to use `const`:

_Use `const` when you can, and use `let` when you have to._

This means that if you can initialize a variable when you declare it, and don't need to reassign it later, make it a constant.

## Summary

By now you should know a reasonable amount about JavaScript variables and how to create them. In the next article, we'll give you some tests that you can use to check how well you've understood and retained this information.

## A high-level definition

JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.
It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which ([HTML](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content) and [CSS](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics)) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.

![The three layers of standard web technologies; HTML, CSS and JavaScript](cake.png)

- {{glossary("HTML")}} is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.
- {{glossary("CSS")}} is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.
- {{glossary("JavaScript")}} is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

The three layers build on top of one another nicely. Let's take a button as an example. We can mark it up using HTML to give it structure and purpose:

```html live-sample___string-concat-name
<button type="button">Player 1: Chris</button>
```

![Button showing Player 1: Chris with no styling](just-html.png)

Then we can add some CSS into the mix to get it looking nice:

```css live-sample___string-concat-name
button {
  font-family: "Helvetica Neue", "Helvetica", sans-serif;
  letter-spacing: 1px;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  border: 2px solid rgb(200 200 0 / 60%);
  background-color: rgb(0 217 217 / 60%);
  color: rgb(100 0 0 / 100%);
  box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgb(0 0 200 / 40%);
  border-radius: 10px;
  padding: 3px 10px;
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

![Button showing Player 1: Chris with styling](html-and-css.png)

And finally, we can add some JavaScript to implement dynamic behavior:

```js live-sample___string-concat-name
function updateName() {
  const name = prompt("Enter a new name");
  button.textContent = `Player 1: ${name}`;
}

const button = document.querySelector("button");

button.addEventListener("click", updateName);
```

You can click "Play" to see and edit the example in the MDN Playground.
Try clicking on the text label to see what happens.

{{EmbedLiveSample('string-concat-name', , '80', , , , , 'allow-modals')}}

JavaScript can do a lot more than that — let's explore what in more detail.

## So what can it really do?

The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common programming features that allow you to do things like:

- Store useful values inside variables. In the above example for instance, we ask for a new name to be entered then store that name in a variable called `name`.
- Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming). In the above example we take the string "Player 1: " and join it to the `name` variable to create the complete text label, e.g., "Player 1: Chris".
- Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page. We used a {{domxref("Element/click_event", "click")}} event in our example above to detect when the label is clicked and then run the code that updates the text label.
- And much more!

What is even more exciting however is the functionality built on top of the client-side JavaScript language. So-called **Application Programming Interfaces** (**APIs**) provide you with extra superpowers to use in your JavaScript code.

APIs are ready-made sets of code building blocks that allow a developer to implement programs that would otherwise be hard or impossible to implement.
They do the same thing for programming that ready-made furniture kits do for home building — it is much easier to take ready-cut panels and screw them together to make a bookshelf than it is to work out the design yourself, go and find the correct wood, cut all the panels to the right size and shape, find the correct-sized screws, and _then_ put them together to make a bookshelf.

They generally fall into two categories.

![Two categories of API; 3rd party APIs are shown to the side of the browser and browser APIs are in the browser](browser.png)

**Browser APIs** are built into your web browser, and are able to expose data from the surrounding computer environment, or do useful complex things. For example:

- The [DOM (Document Object Model) API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) allows you to manipulate HTML and CSS, creating, removing and changing HTML, dynamically applying new styles to your page, etc.
  Every time you see a popup window appear on a page, or some new content displayed (as we saw above in our simple demo) for example, that's the DOM in action.
- The [Geolocation API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) retrieves geographical information.
  This is how [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) is able to find your location and plot it on a map.
- The [Canvas](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) and [WebGL](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) APIs allow you to create animated 2D and 3D graphics.
  People are doing some amazing things using these web technologies — see [Chrome Experiments](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/chrome) and [webglsamples](https://webglsamples.org/).
- [Audio and Video APIs](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Audio_and_video_delivery) like {{domxref("HTMLMediaElement")}} and [WebRTC](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API) allow you to do really interesting things with multimedia, such as play audio and video right in a web page, or grab video from your web camera and display it on someone else's computer (try our simple [Snapshot demo](https://chrisdavidmills.github.io/snapshot/) to get the idea).

**Third party APIs** are not built into the browser by default, and you generally have to grab their code and information from somewhere on the Web. For example:

- The [Bluesky API](https://docs.bsky.app/) allows you to do things like displaying your latest posts on your website.
- The [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) and [OpenStreetMap API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API) allows you to embed custom maps into your website, and other such functionality.

> [!NOTE]
> These APIs are advanced, and we'll not be covering any of these in this module. You can find out much more about these in our [Client-side web APIs module](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_APIs).

There's a lot more available, too! However, don't get over excited just yet. You won't be able to build the next Facebook, Google Maps, or Instagram after studying JavaScript for 24 hours — there are a lot of basics to cover first. And that's why you're here — let's move on!

## What is JavaScript doing on your page?

Here we'll actually start looking at some code, and while doing so, explore what actually happens when you run some JavaScript in your page.

Let's briefly recap the story of what happens when you load a web page in a browser (first talked about in our [What is CSS?](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/What_is_CSS#how_is_css_applied_to_html) article). When you load a web page in your browser, you are running your code (the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) inside an execution environment (the browser tab). This is like a factory that takes in raw materials (the code) and outputs a product (the web page).

![HTML, CSS and JavaScript code come together to create the content in the browser tab when the page is loaded](execution.png)

A very common use of JavaScript is to dynamically modify HTML and CSS to update a user interface, via the Document Object Model API (as mentioned above).

### Browser security

Each browser tab has its own separate bucket for running code in (these buckets are called "execution environments" in technical terms) — this means that in most cases the code in each tab is run completely separately, and the code in one tab cannot directly affect the code in another tab — or on another website.
This is a good security measure — if this were not the case, then pirates could start writing code to steal information from other websites, and other such bad things.

> [!NOTE]
> There are ways to send code and data between different websites/tabs in a safe manner, but these are advanced techniques that we won't cover in this course.

### JavaScript running order

When the browser encounters a block of JavaScript, it generally runs it in order, from top to bottom.
This means that you need to be careful what order you put things in.
For example, let's return to the block of JavaScript we saw in our first example:

```js
function updateName() {
  const name = prompt("Enter a new name");
  button.textContent = `Player 1: ${name}`;
}

const button = document.querySelector("button");

button.addEventListener("click", updateName);
```

Here, we first define a code block called `updateName()` (these types of reusable code blocks are called **functions**), which asks the user for a new name and inserts that name into the text of a button. We then store a reference to a button using `document.querySelector` and attach an event listener to it using `addEventListener` so that when the button is clicked, the `updateName()` function is run.

If you were to swap the order of the `const button = ...` and `button.addEventListener(...)` lines, the code would no longer work — instead, you'd get an error returned in the [browser developer console](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools) — `Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'button' before initialization`.
This means that the `button` object has not been initialized yet, so we can't add an event listener to it.

> [!NOTE]
> It is not always true that JavaScript runs exactly in order from top to bottom, due to behaviors like [hoisting](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting), but for now, bear in mind that generally items need to be defined before you can use them. This is a common source of errors.

### Interpreted versus compiled code

You might hear the terms **interpreted** and **compiled** in the context of programming.
In interpreted languages, the code is run from top to bottom and the result of running the code is immediately returned.
You don't have to transform the code into a different form before the browser runs it.
The code is received in its programmer-friendly text form and processed directly from that.

Compiled languages on the other hand are transformed (compiled) into another form before they are run by the computer.
For example, C/C++ are compiled into machine code that is then run by the computer.
The program is executed from a binary format, which was generated from the original program source code.

JavaScript is a lightweight interpreted programming language.
The web browser receives the JavaScript code in its original text form and runs the script from that.
From a technical standpoint, most modern JavaScript interpreters actually use a technique called **just-in-time compiling** to improve performance; the JavaScript source code gets compiled into a faster, binary format while the script is being used, so that it can be run as quickly as possible.
However, JavaScript is still considered an interpreted language, since the compilation is handled at run time, rather than ahead of time.

There are advantages to both types of language, but we won't discuss them right now.

### Server-side versus client-side code

You might also hear the terms **server-side** and **client-side** code, especially in the context of web development.
Client-side code is code that is run on the user's computer — when a web page is viewed, the page's client-side code is downloaded, then run and displayed by the browser.
In this module we are explicitly talking about **client-side JavaScript**.

Server-side code on the other hand is run on the server, then its results are downloaded and displayed in the browser.
Examples of popular server-side web languages include PHP, Python, Ruby, C#, and even JavaScript!
JavaScript can also be used as a server-side language, for example in the popular Node.js environment — you can find out more about server-side JavaScript in our [Dynamic Websites – Server-side programming](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side) topic.

### Dynamic versus static code

The word **dynamic** is used to describe both client-side JavaScript, and server-side languages — it refers to the ability to update the display of a web page/app to show different things in different circumstances, generating new content as required.
Server-side code dynamically generates new content on the server, e.g., pulling data from a database, whereas client-side JavaScript dynamically generates new content inside the browser on the client, e.g., creating a new HTML table, filling it with data requested from the server, then displaying the table in a web page shown to the user.
The meaning is slightly different in the two contexts, but related, and both approaches (server-side and client-side) usually work together.

A web page with no dynamically updating content is referred to as **static** — it just shows the same content all the time.

## How do you add JavaScript to your page?

JavaScript is applied to your HTML page in a similar manner to CSS.
Whereas CSS uses {{htmlelement("link")}} elements to apply external stylesheets and {{htmlelement("style")}} elements to apply internal stylesheets to HTML, JavaScript only needs one friend in the world of HTML — the {{htmlelement("script")}} element. Let's learn how this works.

> [!NOTE]
> Scrimba's [Setting up our JavaScript file](https://scrimba.com/learn-javascript-c0v/~03?via=mdn) <sup>[_MDN learning partner_](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Learning_content#partner_links_and_embeds)</sup> interactive tutorial walks through a couple of different ways to add JavaScript to your HTML.

### Internal JavaScript

1. First of all, make a local copy of our example file [apply-javascript.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/introduction-to-js-1/what-is-js/apply-javascript.html). Save it in a directory somewhere sensible.
2. Open the file in your web browser and in your text editor. You'll see that the HTML creates a simple web page containing a clickable button.
3. Next, go to your text editor and add the following at the bottom of your body — just before your closing `</body>` tag:

   ```html
   <script>
     // JavaScript goes here
   </script>
   ```

   Note that the code in your web documents is generally loaded and executed in the order it appears on the page. By placing the JavaScript at the bottom, we ensure that all HTML elements are loaded. (See also [Script loading strategies](#script_loading_strategies) below.)

4. Now we'll add some JavaScript inside our {{htmlelement("script")}} element to make the page do something more interesting — add the following code just below the "// JavaScript goes here" line:

   ```js
   function createParagraph() {
     const para = document.createElement("p");
     para.textContent = "You clicked the button!";
     document.body.appendChild(para);
   }

   const buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button");

   for (const button of buttons) {
     button.addEventListener("click", createParagraph);
   }
   ```

5. Save your file and refresh the browser — now you should see that when you click the button, a new paragraph is generated and placed below.

> [!NOTE]
> If your example doesn't seem to work, go through the steps again and check that you did everything right.
> Did you save your local copy of the starting code as a `.html` file?
> Did you add your {{htmlelement("script")}} element just before the `</body>` tag?
> Did you enter the JavaScript exactly as shown? **JavaScript is case sensitive, and very fussy, so you need to enter the syntax exactly as shown, otherwise it may not work.**

> [!NOTE]
> You can see this version on GitHub as [apply-javascript-internal.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/introduction-to-js-1/what-is-js/apply-javascript-internal.html) ([see it live too](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/introduction-to-js-1/what-is-js/apply-javascript-internal.html)).

### External JavaScript

This works great, but what if we wanted to put our JavaScript in an external file? Let's explore this now.

1. First, create a new file in the same directory as your sample HTML file. Call it `script.js` — make sure it has that .js filename extension, as that's how it is recognized as JavaScript.
2. Remove your current {{htmlelement("script")}} element at the bottom of the `</body>` and add the following just before the closing `</head>` tag (that way the browser can start loading the file sooner than when it's at the bottom):

   ```html
   <script type="module" src="script.js"></script>
   ```

3. Inside `script.js`, add the following script:

   ```js
   function createParagraph() {
     const para = document.createElement("p");
     para.textContent = "You clicked the button!";
     document.body.appendChild(para);
   }

   const buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button");

   for (const button of buttons) {
     button.addEventListener("click", createParagraph);
   }
   ```

4. Save and refresh your browser. You'll discover that clicking the button has no effect, and if you check your browser's console, you'll see an error along the lines of `Cross-origin request blocked`. That's because like many external resources, JavaScript modules need to be loaded from the [same origin](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) as the HTML, and `file://` URLs don't qualify. There are two solutions to fix this problem:
   - Our recommended solution is to [set up a local testing server](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/set_up_a_local_testing_server). With the server program running and serving the `apply-javascript-external.html` and `script.js` files on port `8000`, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.
   - If you cannot run a local server, you can also use `<script defer src="script.js"></script>` instead of `<script type="module" src="script.js"></script>`. See [Script loading strategies](#script_loading_strategies) below for more information. But note that features we use in other parts of the tutorial may require a local HTTP server anyway.
5. Now the website works just the same as before, but now we've got our JavaScript in an external file.
   This is generally a good thing in terms of organizing your code and making it reusable across multiple HTML files.
   Plus, the HTML is easier to read without huge chunks of script dumped in it.

> [!NOTE]
> You can see this version on GitHub as [apply-javascript-external.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/introduction-to-js-1/what-is-js/apply-javascript-external.html) and [script.js](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/introduction-to-js-1/what-is-js/script.js) ([see it live too](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/introduction-to-js-1/what-is-js/apply-javascript-external.html)).

### Inline JavaScript handlers

Note that sometimes you'll come across bits of actual JavaScript code living inside HTML.
It might look something like this:

```js example-bad
function createParagraph() {
  const para = document.createElement("p");
  para.textContent = "You clicked the button!";
  document.body.appendChild(para);
}
```

```html example-bad
<button onclick="createParagraph()">Click me!</button>
```

You can try this version of our demo below.

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Inline_JavaScript_handlers', '100%', 150) }}

This demo has exactly the same functionality as in the previous two sections, except that the {{htmlelement("button")}} element includes an inline `onclick` handler to make the function run when the button is pressed.

**Please don't do this, however.** It is bad practice to pollute your HTML with JavaScript, and it is inefficient — you'd have to include the `onclick="createParagraph()"` attribute on every button you want the JavaScript to apply to.

### Using addEventListener instead

Instead of including JavaScript in your HTML, use a pure JavaScript construct.
The `querySelectorAll()` function allows you to select all the buttons on a page.
You can then loop through the buttons, assigning a handler for each using `addEventListener()`.
The code for this is shown below:

```js
const buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button");

for (const button of buttons) {
  button.addEventListener("click", createParagraph);
}
```

This might be a bit longer than the `onclick` attribute, but it will work for all buttons — no matter how many are on the page, nor how many are added or removed.
The JavaScript does not need to be changed.

> [!NOTE]
> Try editing your version of `apply-javascript.html` and add a few more buttons into the file.
> When you reload, you should find that all of the buttons when clicked will create a paragraph.
> Neat, huh?

### Script loading strategies

All the HTML on a page is loaded in the order in which it appears.
If you are using JavaScript to manipulate elements on the page (or more accurately, the [Document Object Model](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/DOM_scripting#the_document_object_model)), your code won't work if the JavaScript is loaded and parsed before the HTML you are trying to do something to.

There are a few different strategies to make sure your JavaScript only runs after the HTML is parsed:

- In the internal JavaScript example above, the script element is placed at the bottom of the body of the document, and therefore only run after the rest of the HTML body is parsed.
- In the external JavaScript example above, the script element is placed in the head of the document, before the HTML body is parsed. But because we're using `<script type="module">`, the code is treated as a [module](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) and the browser waits for all HTML to be processed before executing JavaScript modules. (You could also place external scripts at the bottom of the body. But if there is a lot of HTML and the network is slow, it may take a lot of time before the browser can even start fetching and loading the script, so placing external scripts in the head is usually better.)
- If you still want to use non-module scripts in the document head, which could block the whole page from displaying, and could cause errors because it executes before the HTML is parsed:
  - For external scripts, you should add the `defer` (or if you don't need the HTML to be ready, the `async`) attribute on the {{htmlelement("script")}} element.
  - For internal scripts, you should wrap the code in a [`DOMContentLoaded` event listener](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/DOMContentLoaded_event).

  This is beyond the scope of the tutorial at this point, but unless you need to support very old browsers, you don't have to do this and can just use `<script type="module">` instead.

## Comments

As with HTML and CSS, it is possible to write comments into your JavaScript code that will be ignored by the browser, and exist to provide instructions to your fellow developers on how the code works (and you, if you come back to your code after six months and can't remember what you did).
Comments are very useful, and you should use them often, particularly for larger applications.
There are two types:

- A single line comment is written after a double forward slash (`//`), e.g.

  ```js
  // I am a comment
  ```

- A multi-line comment is written between the strings `/*` and `*/`, e.g.

  ```js
  /*
    I am also
    a comment
  */
  ```

So for example, we could annotate our last demo's JavaScript with comments like so:

```js
// Function: creates a new paragraph and appends it to the bottom of the HTML body.

function createParagraph() {
  const para = document.createElement("p");
  para.textContent = "You clicked the button!";
  document.body.appendChild(para);
}

/*
  1. Get references to all the buttons on the page in an array format.
  2. Loop through all the buttons and add a click event listener to each one.

  When any button is pressed, the createParagraph() function will be run.
*/

const buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button");

for (const button of buttons) {
  button.addEventListener("click", createParagraph);
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> In general more comments are usually better than less, but you should be careful if you find yourself adding lots of comments to explain what variables are (your variable names perhaps should be more intuitive), or to explain very simple operations (maybe your code is overcomplicated).

## Summary

So there you go, your first step into the world of JavaScript.
We've begun with just theory, to start getting you used to why you'd use JavaScript and what kind of things you can do with it.
Along the way, you saw a few code examples and learned how JavaScript fits in with the rest of the code on your website, amongst other things.

JavaScript may seem a bit daunting right now, but don't worry — in this course, we will take you through it in simple steps that will make sense going forward.
In the next article, we will plunge straight into the practical, getting you to jump straight in and build your own JavaScript examples.

## Types of error

Generally speaking, when you do something wrong in code, there are two main types of error that you'll come across:

- **Syntax errors**: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through — you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually not too hard to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!
- **Logic errors**: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.

Okay, so it's not quite _that_ simple — there are some other differentiators as you drill down deeper. But the above classifications will do at this early stage in your career. We'll look at both of these types going forward.

## An erroneous example

To get started, let's return to our number guessing game — except this time we'll be exploring a version that has some deliberate errors introduced. Go to GitHub and make yourself a local copy of [number-game-errors.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/introduction-to-js-1/troubleshooting/number-game-errors.html) (see it [running live here](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/introduction-to-js-1/troubleshooting/number-game-errors.html)).

1. To get started, open the local copy inside your favorite text editor, and your browser.
2. Try playing the game — you'll notice that when you press the "Submit guess" button, it doesn't work!

> [!NOTE]
> You might well have your own version of the game example that doesn't work, which you might want to fix! We'd still like you to work through the article with our version, so that you can learn the techniques we are teaching here. Then you can go back and try to fix your example.

At this point, let's consult the developer console to see if it reports any syntax errors, then try to fix them. You'll learn how below.

## Fixing syntax errors

Earlier on in the course we got you to type some simple JavaScript commands into the [developer tools JavaScript console](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools) (if you can't remember how to open this in your browser, follow the previous link to find out how). What's even more useful is that the console gives you error messages whenever a syntax error exists inside the JavaScript being fed into the browser's JavaScript engine. Now let's go hunting.

1. Go to the tab that you've got `number-game-errors.html` open in, and open your JavaScript console. You should see an error message along the following lines: !["Number guessing game" demo page in Firefox. One error is visible in the JavaScript console: "X TypeError: guessSubmit.addeventListener is not a function [Learn More] (number-game-errors.html:87:19)".](not-a-function.png)
2. The first line of the error message is:

   ```plain
   Uncaught TypeError: guessSubmit.addeventListener is not a function
   number-game-errors.html:87:19
   ```

   - The first part, `Uncaught TypeError: guessSubmit.addeventListener is not a function`, is telling us something about what went wrong.
   - The second part, `number-game-errors.html:87:19`, is telling us where in the code the error came from: line 87, character 19 of the file "number-game-errors.html".

3. If we look at line 87 in our code editor, we'll find this line:

   ```js
   guessSubmit.addeventListener("click", checkGuess);
   ```

4. The error message says "guessSubmit.addeventListener is not a function", which means that the function we're calling is not recognized by the JavaScript interpreter. Often, this error message actually means that we've spelled something wrong. If you are not sure of the correct spelling of a piece of syntax, it is often good to look up the feature on MDN. The best way to do this currently is to search for "mdn _name-of-feature_" with your favorite search engine. Here's a shortcut to save you some time in this instance: [`addEventListener()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener).
5. So, looking at this page, the error appears to be that we've spelled the function name wrong! Remember that JavaScript is case-sensitive, so any slight difference in spelling or casing will cause an error. Changing `addeventListener` to `addEventListener` should fix this. Do this now.

> [!NOTE]

### Syntax errors round two

1. Save your page and refresh, and you should see the error has gone.
2. Now if you try to enter a guess and press the Submit guess button, you'll see another error! ![Screenshot of the same "Number guessing game" demo. This time, a different error is visible in the console, reading "X TypeError: lowOrHi is null".](variable-is-null.png)
3. This time the error being reported is:

   ```plain
   Uncaught TypeError: can't access property "textContent", lowOrHi is null
   ```

   Depending on the browser you are using, you might see a different message here. The message above is what Firefox will show you, but Chrome, for example, will show you this:

   ```plain
   Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'textContent')
   ```

   It's the same error, but different browsers describe it in a different way.

   > [!NOTE]
   > This error didn't come up as soon as the page was loaded because this error occurred inside a function (inside the `checkGuess() { }` block). As you'll learn in more detail in our later [functions article](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Functions), code inside functions runs in a separate scope than code outside functions. In this case, the code was not run and the error was not thrown until the `checkGuess()` function was run by line 87.

4. The line number given in the error is 79. Have a look at line 79, and you'll see the following code:

   ```js
   lowOrHi.textContent = "Last guess was too high!";
   ```

5. This line is trying to set the `textContent` property of the `lowOrHi` variable to a text string, but it's not working because `lowOrHi` does not contain what it's supposed to. Let's see why this is — try searching for other instances of `lowOrHi` in the code. The earliest instance you'll find is on line 51:

   ```js
   const lowOrHi = document.querySelector("lowOrHi");
   ```

6. At this point we are trying to make the variable contain a reference to an element in the document's HTML. Let's see what the variable contains after this line has been run. Add the following code on line 54:

   ```js
   console.log(lowOrHi);
   ```

   This code will print the value of `lowOrHi` to the console after we tried to set it in line 51. See {{domxref("console/log_static", "console.log()")}} for more information.

7. Save and refresh, and you should now see the `console.log()` result in your console. ![Screenshot of the same demo. One log statement is visible in the console, reading simply "null".](console-log-output.png) Sure enough, `lowOrHi`'s value is `null` at this point, and this matches up with the Firefox error message `lowOrHi is null`. So there is definitely a problem with line 51. The [`null`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/null) value means "nothing", or "no value". So our code to set `lowOrHi` to an element is going wrong.

8. Let's think about what the problem could be. Line 51 is using a [`document.querySelector()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector) method to get a reference to an element by selecting it with a CSS selector. Looking further up our file, we can find the paragraph in question:

   ```html
   <p class="lowOrHi"></p>
   ```

9. So we need a class selector here, which begins with a dot (`.`), but the selector being passed into the `querySelector()` method in line 51 has no dot. This could be the problem! Try changing `lowOrHi` to `.lowOrHi` in line 51.
10. Try saving and refreshing again, and your `console.log()` statement should return the `<p>` element we want. Phew! Another error fixed! You can delete your `console.log()` line now, or keep it to reference later on — your choice.

> [!NOTE]
> See our [TypeError: "x" is (not) "y"](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Unexpected_type) reference page for more details about this error.

### Syntax errors round three

1. Now if you try playing the game through again, you should get more success — the game should play through absolutely fine, until you end the game, either by guessing the right number, or by running out of guesses.
2. At that point, the game fails again, and the same error is spat out that we got at the beginning — "TypeError: resetButton.addeventListener is not a function"! However, this time it's listed as coming from line 95.
3. Looking at line number 95, it is easy to see that we've made the same mistake here. We again just need to change `addeventListener` to `addEventListener`. Do this now.

## A logic error

At this point, the game should play through fine, however after playing through a few times you'll undoubtedly notice that the game always chooses 1 as the "random" number you've got to guess. Definitely not quite how we want the game to play out!

There's definitely a problem in the game logic somewhere — the game is not returning an error; it just isn't playing right.

1. Search for the `randomNumber` variable, and the lines where the random number is first set. The instance that stores the random number that we want to guess at the start of the game should be around line number 47:

   ```js
   let randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random()) + 1;
   ```

2. And the one that generates the random number before each subsequent game is around line 114:

   ```js
   randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random()) + 1;
   ```

3. To check whether these lines are indeed the problem, let's turn to our friend `console.log()` again — insert the following line directly below each of the above two lines:

   ```js
   console.log(randomNumber);
   ```

4. Save and refresh, then play a few games — you'll see that `randomNumber` is equal to 1 at each point where it is logged to the console.

### Working through the logic

To fix this, let's consider how this line is working. First, we invoke [`Math.random()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random), which generates a random decimal number between 0 and 1, e.g., 0.5675493843.

```js
Math.random();
```

Next, we pass the result of invoking `Math.random()` through [`Math.floor()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/floor), which rounds the number passed to it down to the nearest whole number. We then add 1 to that result:

```js
Math.floor(Math.random()) + 1;
```

Rounding a random decimal number between 0 and 1 down will always return 0, so adding 1 to it will always return 1. We need to multiply the random number by 100 before we round it down. The following would give us a random number between 0 and 99:

```js
Math.floor(Math.random() * 100);
```

Hence us wanting to add 1, to give us a random number between 1 and 100:

```js
Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
```

Try updating both lines like this, then save and refresh — the game should now play like we are intending it to!

## Other common errors

There are other common errors you'll come across in your code. This section highlights most of them.

### The game is over after the first wrong guess

This could be another symptom of mixing up the assignment and strict equality operators. For example, if we were to change this line inside `checkGuess()`:

```js
} else if (guessCount === 10) {
```

to

```js
} else if (guessCount = 10) {
```

the test would always return `true`, causing the program to `setGameOver()` after the first wrong guess. Be careful!

### SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list

This one is pretty simple — it generally means that you've missed the closing parenthesis at the end of a function/method call.

> [!NOTE]
> See our [SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Missing_parenthesis_after_argument_list) reference page for more details about this error.

### SyntaxError: missing : after property id

This error usually relates to an incorrectly formed JavaScript object, but in this case we managed to get it by changing

```js
function checkGuess() {
```

to

```js
function checkGuess( {
```

This has caused the browser to think that we are trying to pass the contents of the function into the function as an argument. Be careful with those parentheses!

### SyntaxError: missing } after function body

This is easy — it generally means that you've missed one of your curly braces from a function or conditional structure. We got this error by deleting one of the closing curly braces near the bottom of the `checkGuess()` function.

### SyntaxError: expected expression, got '_string_' or SyntaxError: string literal contains an unescaped line break

These errors generally mean that you've left off a string value's opening or closing quote mark. In the first error above, _string_ would be replaced with the unexpected character(s) that the browser found instead of a quote mark at the start of a string. The second error means that the string has not been ended with a quote mark.

For all of these errors, think about how we tackled the examples we looked at in the walkthrough. When an error arises, look at the line number you are given, go to that line and see if you can spot what's wrong. Bear in mind that the error is not necessarily going to be on that line, and also that the error might not be caused by the exact same problem we cited above!

> [!NOTE]
> See our [SyntaxError: Unexpected token](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Unexpected_token) and [SyntaxError: string literal contains an unescaped line break](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/String_literal_EOL) reference pages for more details about these errors.

## Summary

So there we have it, the basics of figuring out errors in simple JavaScript programs. It won't always be that simple to work out what's wrong in your code, but at least this will save you a few hours of sleep and allow you to progress a bit faster when things don't turn out right, especially in the earlier stages of your learning journey.

There are many other elements in HTML for defining text semantics, which we didn't get to in the [Emphasis and importance](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Emphasis_and_importance) article. The elements described in this article are less known, but still useful to know about (and this is still not a complete list by any means). Here you'll learn about marking up quotations, computer code and other related text, subscript and superscript, contact information, and more.

## Quotations

HTML contains features available for marking up quotations; which element you use depends on whether you are marking up a block or inline quotation.

### Blockquotes

If a section of block level content (be it a paragraph, multiple paragraphs, a list, etc.) is quoted from somewhere else, you should wrap it inside a {{htmlelement("blockquote")}} element to signify this, and include a URL pointing to the source of the quote inside a [`cite`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/blockquote#cite) attribute. For example, the following markup is taken from the MDN `<blockquote>` element page:

```html
<p>
  The <strong>HTML <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> Element</strong> (or
  <em>HTML Block Quotation Element</em>) indicates that the enclosed text is an
  extended quotation.
</p>
```

To turn this into a block quote, we would just do this:

```html
<p>Here is a blockquote:</p>
<blockquote
  cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/blockquote">
  <p>
    The <strong>HTML <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> Element</strong> (or
    <em>HTML Block Quotation Element</em>) indicates that the enclosed text is
    an extended quotation.
  </p>
</blockquote>
```

Browser default styling will render this as an indented paragraph, as an indicator that it is a quote; the paragraph above the quotation is there to demonstrate that.

{{EmbedLiveSample('Blockquotes', '100%', '200px')}}

### Inline quotations

Inline quotations work in exactly the same way, except that they use the {{htmlelement("q")}} element. For example, the below bit of markup contains a quotation from the MDN `<q>` page:

```html
<p>
  The quote element — <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> — is
  <q
    cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/q">
    intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks.
  </q>
</p>
```

Browser default styling will render this as normal text put in quotes to indicate a quotation, like so:

{{EmbedLiveSample('Inline_quotations', '100%', '78px')}}

### Citations

The content of the [`cite`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/blockquote#cite) attribute sounds useful, but unfortunately browsers, screen readers, etc. don't really do much with it. There is no way to get the browser to display the contents of `cite`, without writing your own solution using JavaScript or CSS. If you want to make the source of the quotation available on the page you need to make it available in the text via a link or some other appropriate way.

There is a {{htmlelement("cite")}} element, but this is meant to contain the title of the resource being quoted, e.g., the name of the book. There is no reason, however, why you couldn't link the text inside `<cite>` to the quote source in some way:

```html-nolint
<p>
  According to the
  <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/blockquote">
    <cite>MDN blockquote page</cite></a>:
</p>

<blockquote
  cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/blockquote">
  <p>
    The <strong>HTML <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> Element</strong> (or
    <em>HTML Block Quotation Element</em>) indicates that the enclosed text is
    an extended quotation.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  The quote element — <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> — is
  <q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/q">
    intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks.
  </q>
  — <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/q"><cite>MDN q page</cite></a>.
</p>
```

Citations are styled in italic font by default.

### Who said that? Blockquote practice

Time for another task! In this example we'd like you to:

1. Click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.
2. Turn the middle paragraph into a blockquote, which includes a `cite` attribute.
3. Turn "The Need To Eliminate Negative Self Talk" in the third paragraph into an inline quote, and include a `cite` attribute.
4. Wrap the title of each source in `<cite>` tags and turn each one into a link to that source.

The citation sources you need are:

- `http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/c/confucius.html` for the Confucius quote
- `http://example.com/affirmationsforpositivethinking` for "The Need To Eliminate Negative Self Talk".

If you make a mistake, you can clear your work using the _Reset_ button in the MDN Playground. If you get really stuck, you can view the solution below the code block.

```html live-sample___advanced-text-1
<p>Hello and welcome to my motivation page. As Confucius' quotes site says:</p>
<p>It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.</p>
<p>

  Negative Self Talk (as mentioned in Affirmations for Positive Thinking.)
</p>
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('advanced-text-1', "100%", 200) }}

Your finished HTML should look like this:

  <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/c/confucius.html"
    ><cite>Confucius' quotes site</cite></a

  says:
</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/c/confucius.html">
  <p>It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  I also love the concept of positive thinking, and
  <q cite="http://example.com/affirmationsforpositivethinking"
    >The Need To Eliminate Negative Self Talk</q
  >
  (as mentioned in
  <a href="http://example.com/affirmationsforpositivethinking"
    ><cite>Affirmations for Positive Thinking</cite></a
  >.)
</p>
```

</details>

## Abbreviations

Another fairly common element you'll meet when looking around the Web is {{htmlelement("abbr")}} — this is used to wrap around an abbreviation or acronym. When including either, provide a full expansion of the term in plain text on first use, along with the `<abbr>` to mark up the abbreviation. This provides a hint to user agents on how to announce/display the content while informing all users what the abbreviation means.

If providing the expansion in addition to the abbreviation makes little sense, and the abbreviation or acronym is a fairly shortened term, provide the full expansion of the term as the value of the [`title`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/title) attribute:

### Abbreviation example

Let's look at an example.

```html
<p>
  We use <abbr>HTML</abbr>, Hypertext Markup Language, to structure our web
  documents.
</p>

<p>
  I think <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Green did it in the kitchen with
  the chainsaw.
</p>
```

These are rendered as follows:

{{EmbedLiveSample('Abbreviation_example', '100%', '90')}}

> [!NOTE]
> Earlier versions of html also included support for the {{htmlelement("acronym")}} element, but it was removed from the HTML spec in favor of using `<abbr>` to represent both abbreviations and acronyms. `<acronym>` should not be used.

### Let's mark up an abbreviation

For this learning task, we'd like you to mark up an abbreviation.

1. Click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.
2. Mark up the included abbreviations using appropriate HTML. Feel free also to replace it with one of your own, and try marking that up instead.

If you make a mistake, you can clear your work using the _Reset_ button in the MDN Playground. If you get really stuck, you can view the solution below the code block.

```html-nolint live-sample___advanced-text-2
<p>NASA sure does some exciting work.</p>

<p>The new user interface design LGTM!</p>
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('advanced-text-2', "100%", 90) }}

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

Your finished HTML should look something like the following code snippet:

```html
<p>
  <abbr>NASA</abbr> (the National Aeronautics and Space Administration) sure
  does some exciting work.
</p>

<p>The new user interface design <abbr title="Looks good to me">LGTM</abbr>!</p>
```

- Arguably, NASA should be expanded in text on first mention, as it is a useful bit of information for everyone to have available in the text.
- Acronyms like "LGTM", on the other hand, are purely written to save space and time so it wouldn't make sense to also write it out, hence putting the expansion in the `title` attribute. In a real application, you probably wouldn't do this by hand — you'd get some kind of script to add it automatically for known terms.

</details>

## Marking up contact details

HTML has an element for marking up contact details — {{htmlelement("address")}}. This wraps around your contact details, for example:

```html
<address>Chris Mills, Manchester, The Grim North, UK</address>
```

It could also include more complex markup, and other forms of contact information, for example:

```html
<address>
  <p>
    Chris Mills<br />
    Manchester<br />
    The Grim North<br />
    UK
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Tel: 01234 567 890</li>
    <li>Email: me@grim-north.co.uk</li>
  </ul>
</address>
```

Note that something like this would also be OK, if the linked page contained the contact information:

```html
<address>
  Page written by <a href="../authors/chris-mills/">Chris Mills</a>.
</address>
```

> [!NOTE]
> The {{htmlelement("address")}} element should only be used to provide contact information for the document contained by the nearest {{htmlelement("article")}} or {{htmlelement("body")}} element. It would be correct to use it in the footer of a site to include the contact information of the entire site, or inside an article for the contact details of the author, but not to mark up a list of addresses unrelated to the content of that page.

## Superscript and subscript

You will occasionally need to use superscript and subscript when marking up items like dates, chemical formulae, and mathematical equations so they have the correct meaning. The {{htmlelement("sup")}} and {{htmlelement("sub")}} elements handle this job. For example:

```html
<p>My birthday is on the 25<sup>th</sup> of May 2001.</p>
<p>
  Caffeine's chemical formula is
  C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.
</p>
<p>If x<sup>2</sup> is 9, x must equal 3 or -3.</p>
```

The output of this code looks like so:

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Superscript_and_subscript', '100%', 160) }}

## Representing computer code

There are a number of elements available for marking up computer code using HTML:

- {{htmlelement("code")}}: For marking up generic pieces of computer code.
- {{htmlelement("pre")}}: For retaining whitespace (generally code blocks) — if you use indentation or excess whitespace inside your text, browsers will ignore it and you will not see it on your rendered page. If you wrap the text in `<pre></pre>` tags however, your whitespace will be rendered identically to how you see it in your text editor.
- {{htmlelement("var")}}: For specifically marking up variable names.
- {{htmlelement("kbd")}}: For marking up keyboard (and other types of) input entered into the computer.
- {{htmlelement("samp")}}: For marking up the output of a computer program.

Let's look at examples of these elements and how they're used to represent computer code.
If you want to see the full file, take a look at the [other-semantics.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/introduction-to-html/advanced-text-formatting/other-semantics.html) sample file.
You can download the file and open it in your browser to see for yourself, but here is a snippet of the code:

```html
<pre><code>const para = document.querySelector('p');

para.onclick = function() {
  alert('Owww, stop poking me!');
}</code></pre>

<p>
  You shouldn't use presentational elements like <code>&lt;font&gt;</code> and
  <code>&lt;center&gt;</code>.
</p>

<p>
  In the above JavaScript example, <var>para</var> represents a paragraph
  element.
</p>

<p>Select all the text with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>.</p>

<pre>$ <kbd>ping mozilla.org</kbd>
<samp>PING mozilla.org (63.245.215.20): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 63.245.215.20: icmp_seq=0 ttl=40 time=158.233 ms</samp></pre>
```

The above code will look like so:

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Representing_computer_code','100%',350) }}

## Marking up times and dates

HTML also provides the {{htmlelement("time")}} element for marking up times and dates in a machine-readable format. For example:

```html
<time datetime="2016-01-20">20 January 2016</time>
```

Why is this useful? Well, there are many different ways that humans write down dates. The above date could be written as:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

- 20 January 2016
- 20th January 2016
- Jan 20 2016
- 20/01/16
- 01/20/16
- The 20th of next month
- <span lang="fr">20e Janvier 2016</span>
- <span lang="ja">2016 年 1 月 20 日</span>
- And so on.

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

But these different forms cannot be easily recognized by computers — what if you wanted to automatically grab the dates of all events in a page and insert them into a calendar? The {{htmlelement("time")}} element allows you to attach an unambiguous, machine-readable time/date for this purpose.

The basic example above just provides a simple machine readable date, but there are many other options that are possible, for example:

```html
<!-- Standard simple date -->
<time datetime="2016-01-20">20 January 2016</time>
<!-- Just year and month -->
<time datetime="2016-01">January 2016</time>
<!-- Just month and day -->
<time datetime="01-20">20 January</time>
<!-- Just time, hours and minutes -->
<time datetime="19:30">19:30</time>
<!-- You can do seconds and milliseconds too! -->
<time datetime="19:30:01.856">19:30:01.856</time>
<!-- Date and time -->
<time datetime="2016-01-20T19:30">7.30pm, 20 January 2016</time>
<!-- Date and time with timezone offset -->
<time datetime="2016-01-20T19:30+01:00">
  7.30pm, 20 January 2016 is 8.30pm in France
</time>
<!-- Calling out a specific week number -->
<time datetime="2016-W04">The fourth week of 2016</time>
```

## Summary

That marks the end of our study of less-common HTML text semantics. What you have seen during this course is not an exhaustive list of HTML text elements — we wanted to try to cover the essentials, and some of the more common ones you will see in the wild.

Next up, we'll give you some tests that you can use to check how well you've understood and retained the information we've provided on less-common HTML text features.

In this article, we cover the absolute basics of HTML. To get you started, this article defines elements, attributes, and all the other important terms you may have heard. It also explains where these fit into HTML. You will learn how HTML elements are structured, how a typical HTML page is structured, and other important basic language features. Along the way, there will be an opportunity to play with HTML too!

## What is HTML?

{{glossary("HTML")}} (HyperText Markup Language) is a _markup language_ that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of {{glossary("Element", "elements")}}, which you use to enclose, wrap, or _mark up_ different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing {{glossary("Tag", "tags")}} can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider the following line of text:

```plain
My cat is very grumpy
```

If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph ({{htmlelement("p")}}) element:

```html
<p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
```

HTML lives inside text files called **HTML documents**, or just **documents**, with a `.html` file extension. Where previously we've talked about web pages, an HTML document contains the web page's content and specifies its structure.

The most common HTML file you'll encounter is `index.html`, which is generally used to contain a website's home page content. It's also common to see subfolders with their own `index.html`, so a website can have multiple index files in different places.

> [!NOTE]
> Tags in HTML are not case-sensitive. This means they can be written in uppercase or lowercase. For example, a {{htmlelement("title")}} tag could be written as `<title>`, `<TITLE>`, `<Title>`, `<TiTlE>`, etc., and it will work. However, it is best practice to write all tags in lowercase for consistency and readability.

## Anatomy of an HTML element

Let's further explore our paragraph element from the previous section:

![A sample code snippet demonstrating the structure of an html element.<p> My cat is very grumpy </p>.](grumpy-cat-small.png)

The anatomy of our element is:

- **The opening tag:** This consists of the name of the element (in this example, _p_ for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.
- **The content:** This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.
- **The closing tag:** This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.

The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.

> [!NOTE]
> Head on over to our learning partner Scrimba's [HTML tags](https://scrimba.com/learn-html-and-css-c0p/~02?via=mdn) <sup>[_MDN learning partner_](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Learning_content#partner_links_and_embeds)</sup> scrim for an interactive explanation of HTML tags.

### Creating your first HTML element

Let's give you some practice at writing your own HTML elements:

1. Click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.
2. Wrap the line of text with the tags `<em>` and `</em>`. To _open the element_, put the opening tag `<em>` at the start of the line. To _close the element_, put the closing tag `</em>` at the end of the line. Doing this should give the rendered text in the output panel italic text formatting.
3. If you are feeling adventurous, try looking up some more HTML elements and applying them to the text example.

If you make a mistake, you can clear your work using the _Reset_ button in the MDN Playground. If you get really stuck, you can view the solution below the code block.

```html live-sample___basic_html_1
This is my text.
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('basic_html_1', "100%", 60) }}

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

Your finished line of HTML should look like this:

```html
<em>This is my text.</em>
```

</details>

### Nesting elements

Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called _nesting_. If we wanted to state that our cat is **very** grumpy, we could wrap the word _very_ in a {{htmlelement("strong")}} element, which means that the word is to have strong(er) text formatting:

```html
<p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>
```

There is a right and wrong way to do nesting. In the example above, we opened the `p` element first, then opened the `strong` element. For proper nesting, we should close the `strong` element first, before closing the `p`.

The following is an example of the _wrong_ way to do nesting:

```html-nolint example-bad
<p>My cat is <strong>very grumpy.</p></strong>
```

The **tags have to open and close in a way that they are inside or outside one another**. With the kind of overlap in the example above, the browser has to guess at your intent. This kind of guessing can result in unexpected results.

### Void elements

Not all elements follow the pattern of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Some elements consist of a single tag, which is typically used to insert/embed something in the document. Such elements are called {{glossary("void element", "void elements")}}. For example, the {{htmlelement("img")}} element embeds an image file onto a page:

```html
<img
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png"
  alt="Firefox icon" />
```

This would output the following:

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Void_elements', 700, 300, "", "") }}

> [!NOTE]
> In HTML, there is no requirement to add a `/` at the end of a void element's tag, for example: `<img src="images/cat.jpg" alt="cat" />`. However, it is also a valid syntax, and you may do this when you want your HTML to be valid XML.

## Attributes

Elements can also have attributes. Attributes look like this:

![paragraph tag with 'class="editor-note"' attribute emphasized](grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png)

Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this example, the **`class`** attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style information.

An attribute should have:

- A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces too.)
- The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.
- An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.

### Adding attributes to an element

Now it's your turn again. In this section we are going to get you to add attributes to an `<img>` element to get an image displaying on the page. The `<img>` element can take several attributes, including:

- `src`: A **required** attribute that specifies the location of the image. For example: `src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png"`.
- `alt`: A text description of the image. For example: `alt="The Firefox icon"`.
- `width`: The width of the image in pixels. For example: `width="300"`.
- `height`: The height of the image in pixels. For example: `height="300"`.

Follow the steps below to complete the task:

1. Click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.
2. Find your favorite image online, right click it, and press _Copy Image Link/Address_.
3. Back in the MDN Playground, add the `src` attribute to the `<img>` element and set its value to the link from Step 2.
4. Set the `alt` attribute to a suitable description of the image.
5. Set the `width` attribute to a value of say `300` so you can see the image a bit better inside the output panel. Adjust it if needed.

If you make a mistake, you can clear your work using the _Reset_ button in the MDN Playground. If you get really stuck, you can view the solution below the code block.

```html live-sample___basic_html_2
<img />
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('basic_html_2', "100%", 60) }}

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

Your finished HTML element should look like this:

```html
<img src="<URL-OF-IMAGE>" alt="A description of the image" width="300" />
```

</details>

### Boolean attributes

Sometimes you will see attributes written without values. This is entirely acceptable. These are called [Boolean attributes](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Boolean/HTML). When a boolean attribute is written without a value, or with any value, even like `"false"`, the boolean attribute is always set to true. Otherwise, if the attribute is not written in an HTML tag, the attribute is set to false. The spec requires the attribute's value to either be the empty string (including when the attribute has no value explicitly specified) or the same as the attribute's name, but other values work the same. For example, consider the [`disabled`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input#disabled) attribute, which you can assign to form input elements. (You use this to _disable_ the form input elements so the user can't make entries. The disabled elements typically have a grayed-out appearance.) For example:

```html
<input type="text" disabled="disabled" />
```

As shorthand, it is acceptable to write this as follows:

```html
<!-- using the disabled attribute prevents the end user from entering text into the input box -->
<input type="text" disabled />

<!-- text input is allowed, as it doesn't contain the disabled attribute -->
<input type="text" />
```

For reference, the example above also includes a non-disabled form input element. The HTML from the example above produces this result:

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Boolean_attributes', 700, 100, "", "") }}

### Omitting quotes around attribute values

If you look at code for a lot of other sites, you might come across a number of strange markup styles, including attribute values without quotes. This is permitted in certain circumstances, but it can also break your markup in other circumstances. The element in the code snippet below, `<a>`, is called an anchor. Anchors enclose text and turn them into links. The `href` attribute specifies the web address the link points to. You can write this basic version below with _only_ the `href` attribute, like this:

```html
<a href=https://www.mozilla.org/>favorite website</a>
```

Anchors can also have a `title` attribute, a description of the linked page. However, as soon as we add the `title` in the same fashion as the `href` attribute there are problems:

```html-nolint example-bad
<a href=https://www.mozilla.org/ title=The Mozilla homepage>favorite website</a>
```

As written above, the browser misinterprets the markup, mistaking the `title` attribute for three attributes: a title attribute with the value `The`, and two Boolean attributes, `Mozilla` and `homepage`. Obviously, this is not intended! It will cause errors or unexpected behavior, as you can see in the live example below. Try hovering over the link to view the title text!

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Omitting_quotes_around_attribute_values', 700, 100, "", "") }}

Always include the attribute quotes. It avoids such problems, and results in more readable code.

### Single or double quotes?

In this article, you will also notice that the attributes are wrapped in double quotes. However, you might see single quotes in some HTML code. This is a matter of style. You can feel free to choose which one you prefer. Both of these lines are equivalent:

```html-nolint
<a href='https://www.example.com'>A link to my example.</a>

<a href="https://www.example.com">A link to my example.</a>
```

Make sure you don't mix single quotes and double quotes. This example (below) shows a kind of mixing of quotes that will go wrong:

```html-nolint example-bad
<a href="https://www.example.com'>A link to my example.</a>
```

However, if you use one type of quote, you can include the other type of quote _inside_ your attribute values:

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com" title="Isn't this fun?">
  A link to my example.
</a>
```

To use quote marks inside other quote marks of the same type (single quote or double quote), use {{glossary("character reference", "character references")}}.
For example, this will break:

```html-nolint example-bad
<a href="https://www.example.com" title="An "interesting" reference">A link to my example.</a>
```

Instead, you need to do this:

```html-nolint
<a href="https://www.example.com" title="An &quot;interesting&quot; reference">A link to my example.</a>
```

## Anatomy of an HTML document

Individual HTML elements aren't very useful on their own. Next, let's examine how individual elements combine to form an entire HTML page:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is my page</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Here we have:

1. `<!doctype html>`: The doctype. When HTML was young (1991-1992), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML. Doctypes used to look something like this:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
   ```

   More recently, the doctype is a historical artifact that needs to be included for everything else to work right. `<!doctype html>` is the shortest string of characters that counts as a valid doctype. That is all you need to know!

2. `<html></html>`: The {{htmlelement("html")}} element. This element wraps all the content on the page. It is sometimes known as the root element.
3. `<head></head>`: The {{htmlelement("head")}} element. This element acts as a container for everything you want to include on the HTML page, **that isn't the content** the page will show to viewers. This includes keywords and a page description that would appear in search results, CSS to style content, character set declarations, and more. You will learn more about this in the next article of the series.
4. `<meta charset="utf-8">`: The {{htmlelement("meta")}} element. This element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like {{htmlelement("base")}}, {{htmlelement("link")}}, {{htmlelement("script")}}, {{htmlelement("style")}} or {{htmlelement("title")}}. The [`charset`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta#charset) attribute specifies the character encoding for your document as UTF-8, which includes most characters from the vast majority of human written languages. With this setting, the page can now handle any textual content it might contain. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later.
5. `<title></title>`: The {{htmlelement("title")}} element. This sets the title of the page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. The page title is also used to describe the page when it is bookmarked.
6. `<body></body>`: The {{htmlelement("body")}} element. This contains _all_ the content that displays on the page, including text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.

### Adding some features to an HTML document

At this point, we want you to practice writing some slightly more substantial HTML content. To do this, you've got a couple of options — you can create the HTML on your local computer, or use the MDN Playground like in the previous examples.

- To do it on your local machine:
  1. Copy the HTML page example listed in the previous section and paste it into a new file in your code editor.
  2. Make the changes to the page outlined in the instructions below.
  3. Save the file as `index.html` then load it in a new browser tab to see the results.

  > [!NOTE]
  > You can also find this [basic HTML template](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/introduction-to-html/getting-started/index.html) on our GitHub repo. You can make a copy of this file instead of creating it yourself.

- To do it in the MDN Playground, click **"Play"** in the output panel below to edit the example, then follow the below instructions. If you make a mistake, you can clear your work using the _Reset_ button in the MDN Playground.

```html hidden live-sample___basic_html_3
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is my page</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('basic_html_3', "100%", 60) }}

Here are the instructions to follow:

1. Just below the opening tag of the {{htmlelement("body")}} element, add a main title for the document. This should be wrapped inside an `<h1>` opening tag and `</h1>` closing tag.
2. Edit the paragraph content to include text about a topic that you find interesting.
3. Make important words stand out in bold by wrapping them inside a {{htmlelement("strong")}} element.
4. Add two links to your paragraph. This is achieved using the {{htmlelement("a")}} element.
5. Add an image to your document, as [explained earlier in the article](#adding_attributes_to_an_element). Place it below the paragraph. If it is too big to see, add a `width` attribute to it, to shrink it down.

If you get really stuck, you can view the solution here:

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

The contents of your finished HTML element body should look something like this:

```html
<h1>Some music</h1>
<p>
  I really enjoy <strong>playing the drums</strong>. One of my favorite drummers
  is Neal Peart, who used to play in the band
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_%28band%29">Rush</a>. My favorite
  Rush album is currently
  <a href="https://www.deezer.com/album/942295">Moving Pictures</a>.
</p>
<img
  src="https://www.cygnus-x1.net/links/rush/images/albums/sectors/sector2-movingpictures-cover-s.jpg"
  alt="Rush Moving Pictures album cover"
  width="300" />
```

</details>

### Whitespace in HTML

In the examples above, you may have noticed that a lot of whitespace is included in the code. This is optional. These two code snippets are equivalent:

```html-nolint
<p id="noWhitespace">Dogs are silly.</p>

<p id="whitespace">Dogs
    are
        silly.</p>
```

No matter how much whitespace you use inside HTML element content (which can include one or more space characters, but also line breaks), the HTML parser reduces each sequence of whitespace to a single space when rendering the code. So why use so much whitespace? The answer is readability.

It can be easier to understand what is going on in your code if you have it nicely formatted. In our HTML we've got each nested element indented by two spaces more than the one it is sitting inside. It is up to you to choose the style of formatting (how many spaces for each level of indentation, for example), but you should consider formatting it.

Let's have a look at how the browser renders the two paragraphs above with and without whitespace:

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Whitespace_in_HTML', 700, 100) }}

> [!NOTE]
> Accessing the [innerHTML](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML) of elements from JavaScript will keep all the whitespace intact.
> This may return unexpected results if the whitespace is trimmed by the browser.

```js
const noWhitespace = document.getElementById("noWhitespace").innerHTML;
console.log(noWhitespace);
// "Dogs are silly."

const whitespace = document.getElementById("whitespace").innerHTML;
console.log(whitespace);
// "Dogs
//    are
//        silly."
```

## Character references: including special characters in HTML

In HTML, the characters `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`, and `&` are special characters. They are parts of the HTML syntax itself. So how do you include one of these special characters in your text? For example, if you want to use an ampersand or less-than sign, and not have it interpreted as code.

You do this with {{glossary("character reference", "character references")}}. These are special codes that represent characters, to be used in these exact circumstances. Each character reference starts with an ampersand (&), and ends with a semicolon (;).

| Literal character | Character reference equivalent |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| <                 | `&lt;`                         |
| >                 | `&gt;`                         |
| "                 | `&quot;`                       |
| '                 | `&apos;`                       |
| &                 | `&amp;`                        |

The character reference equivalent could be easily remembered because the text it uses can be seen as less than for `&lt;`, quotation for `&quot;` and similarly for others. To find more about entity references, see [List of XML and HTML character entity references](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references) (Wikipedia).

In the example below, there are two paragraphs:

```html-nolint
<p>In HTML, you define a paragraph using the <p> element.</p>

<p>In HTML, you define a paragraph using the &lt;p&gt; element.</p>
```

In the live output below, you can see that the first paragraph has gone wrong. The browser interprets the second instance of `<p>` as starting a new paragraph. The second paragraph looks fine because it has angle brackets with character references.

{{ EmbedLiveSample('Entity_references_Including_special_characters_in_HTML', 700, 200, "", "") }}

> [!NOTE]
> You don't need to use entity references for any other symbols, as modern browsers will handle the actual symbols just fine as long as your HTML's [character encoding is set to UTF-8](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Webpage_metadata#specifying_your_documents_character_encoding).

## HTML comments

HTML has a mechanism to write comments in the code. Browsers ignore comments, effectively making comments invisible to the user. The purpose of comments is to allow you to include notes in the code to explain your logic or coding. This is very useful if you return to a code base after being away for long enough that you don't completely remember it. Likewise, comments are invaluable as different people are making changes and updates.

To write an HTML comment, wrap it in the special markers `<!--` and `-->`. For example:

```html
<p>I'm not inside a comment</p>

<!-- <p>I am!</p> -->
```

As you can see below, only the first paragraph is displayed in the live output.

{{ EmbedLiveSample('HTML_comments', 700, 100, "", "") }}

## Summary

You made it to the end of the article! We hope you enjoyed your tour of the basics of HTML.

At this point, you should understand what HTML looks like, and how it works at a basic level. You should also be able to write a few elements and attributes. The subsequent articles of this module go further on some of the topics introduced here, as well as presenting other concepts of the language.

- As you start to learn more about HTML, consider learning the basics of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). [CSS](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics) is the language used to style web pages, such as changing fonts or colors or altering the page layout. HTML and CSS work well together, as you will soon discover.

## What is a hyperlink?

Hyperlinks are one of the most exciting innovations the Web has to offer.
They've been a feature of the Web since the beginning, and are what makes the Web _a web._
Hyperlinks allow us to link documents to other documents or resources, link to specific parts of documents, or make apps available at a web address.
Almost any web content can be converted to a link so that when clicked or otherwise activated the web browser goes to another web address ({{glossary("URL")}}).

> [!NOTE]
> A URL can point to HTML files, text files, images, text documents, video and audio files, or anything else that lives on the Web.
> If the web browser doesn't know how to display or handle the file, it will ask you if you want to open the file (in which case the duty of opening or handling the file is passed to a suitable native app on the device) or download the file (in which case you can try to deal with it later on).

For example, the BBC homepage contains many links that point not only to multiple news stories, but also different areas of the site (navigation functionality), login/registration pages (user tools), and more.

![front page of bbc.co.uk, showing many news items, and navigation menu functionality](updated-bbc-website.png)

## Anatomy of a link

A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an {{htmlelement("a")}} element and using the [`href`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/a#href) attribute, also known as a **Hypertext Reference**, or **target**, that contains the web address.

```html
<p>
  I'm creating a link to
  <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">the Mozilla homepage</a>.
</p>
```

This gives us the following result:

I'm creating a link to [the Mozilla homepage](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/).

### Block level links

As mentioned before, almost any content can be made into a link, even {{Glossary("Block/CSS", "block-level elements")}}.
If you want to make a heading element a link then wrap it in an anchor (`<a>`) element as shown in the following code snippet:

```html
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">
  <h1>MDN Web Docs</h1>
</a>
<p>
  Documenting web technologies, including CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, since 2005.
</p>
```

This turns the heading into a link:
{{EmbedLiveSample('Block level links', '100%', 150)}}

### Image links

To turn an image into a link, wrap the {{htmlelement("img")}} element with an {{htmlelement("a")}} element. The example below uses a relative path to reference a locally stored SVG image file.

```css hidden
img {
  height: 100px;
  width: 150px;
  border: 1px solid gray;
}
```

```html
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">
  <img src="mdn_logo.svg" alt="MDN Web Docs" />
</a>
```

This makes the MDN logo a link:
{{EmbedLiveSample('Image links', '100%', 150)}}

> [!NOTE]
> You'll find out more about using images on the Web in a future article.

### Adding supporting information with the title attribute

Another attribute you may want to add to your links is `title`.
The title contains additional information about the link, such as which kind of information the page contains, or things to be aware of on the website.

```html-nolint
<p>
  I'm creating a link to
  <a
    href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/"
    title="The best place to find more information about Mozilla's
          mission and how to contribute">
    the Mozilla homepage</a>.
</p>
```

This gives us the following result and hovering over the link displays the title as a tooltip:

{{EmbedLiveSample('Adding supporting information with the title attribute', '100%', 150)}}

> [!NOTE]
> A link title is only revealed on mouse hover, which means that people relying on keyboard controls or touchscreens to navigate web pages will have difficulty accessing title information.
> If a title's information is truly important to the usability of the page, then you should present it in a manner that will be accessible to all users, for example by putting it in the regular text.

### Creating your own example links

OK, now it's your turn!

1. Click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground, or make a copy of our [getting started template](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/introduction-to-html/getting-started/index.html) and copy the below code into there.
2. Link the "Red squirrel" and "Eastern gray squirrel" text to Wikipedia pages that describe the relevant species. Give each link a `title` attribute equal to the species' scientific name.
3. Link the "Wikipedia Squirrel page" text to the main Wikipedia page for squirrels.

If you make a mistake, you can clear your work using the _Reset_ button in the MDN Playground. If you get really stuck, you can view the solution below the code block.

```html live-sample___links-1
<h1>Squirrels</h1>

<p>
  Squirrels are commonly thought of as tree-dwelling mammals, but the squirrel

## A quick primer on URLs and paths

To fully understand link targets, you need to understand URLs and file paths. This section gives you the information you need to achieve this.

A URL, or Uniform Resource Locator is a string of text that defines where something is located on the Web. For example, Mozilla's English homepage is located at `https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/`.

URLs use paths to find files. Paths specify where the file you're interested in is located in the filesystem. Let's look at an example of a directory structure, see the `creating-hyperlinks` directory structure shown below:

![A simple directory structure. The parent directory is called creating-hyperlinks and contains two files called index.html and contacts.html, and two directories called projects and pdfs, which contain an index.html and a project-brief.pdf file, respectively](simple-directory.png)

The **root** of this directory structure is called `creating-hyperlinks`. When working locally with a website, you'll have one directory that contains the entire site. Inside the **root**, we have an `index.html` file and a `contacts.html`. In a real website, `index.html` would be our home page or landing page (a web page that serves as the entry point for a website or a particular section of a website.).

There are also two directories inside our root — `pdfs` and `projects`. These each have a single file inside them — a PDF (`project-brief.pdf`) and an `index.html` file, respectively. Note that you can have two `index.html` files in one project, as long as they're in different filesystem locations. The second `index.html` would perhaps be the main landing page for project-related information.

Let's look at some examples of links between some different files in this directory structure to demonstrate different link types:

- **Same directory**: If you wanted to include a hyperlink inside `index.html` (the top level `index.html`) pointing to `contacts.html`, you would specify the filename that you want to link to, because it's in the same directory as the current file. The URL you would use is `contacts.html`:

  ```html
  <p>
    Want to contact a specific staff member? Find details on our
    <a href="contacts.html">contacts page</a>.
  </p>
  ```

- **Moving down into subdirectories**: If you wanted to include a hyperlink inside `index.html` (the top level `index.html`) pointing to `projects/index.html`, you would need to go down into the `projects` directory before indicating the file you want to link to.
  This is done by specifying the directory's name, then a forward slash, then the name of the file. The URL you would use is `projects/index.html`:

  ```html
  <p>Visit my <a href="projects/index.html">project homepage</a>.</p>
  ```

- **Moving back up into parent directories**: If you wanted to include a hyperlink inside `projects/index.html` pointing to `pdfs/project-brief.pdf`, you'd have to go up a directory level, then back down into the `pdfs` directory.
  To go up a directory, use two dots — `..` — so the URL you would use is `../pdfs/project-brief.pdf`:

  ```html
  <p>A link to my <a href="../pdfs/project-brief.pdf">project brief</a>.</p>
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> You can combine multiple instances of these features into complex URLs, if needed, for example: `../../../complex/path/to/my/file.html`.

### Document fragments

It's possible to link to a specific part of an HTML document, known as a **document fragment**, rather than just to the top of the document.
To do this you first have to assign an [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/id) attribute to the element you want to link to.
It normally makes sense to link to a specific heading, so this would look something like the following:

```html
<h2 id="Mailing_address">Mailing address</h2>
```

Then to link to that specific `id`, you'd include it at the end of the URL, preceded by a hash/pound symbol (`#`), for example:

```html
<p>
  Want to write us a letter? Use our
  <a href="contacts.html#Mailing_address">mailing address</a>.
</p>
```

You can even use the document fragment reference on its own to link to _another part of the current document_:

```html
<p>
  The <a href="#Mailing_address">company mailing address</a> can be found at the
  bottom of this page.
</p>
```

### Absolute versus relative URLs

Two terms you'll come across on the web are **absolute URL** and **relative URL:**

**Absolute URL**: Points to a location defined by its absolute location on the web, including {{glossary("protocol")}} and {{glossary("domain name")}}.
For example, if an `index.html` page is uploaded to a directory called `projects` that sits inside the **root** of a web server, and the website's domain is `https://www.example.com`, the page would be available at `https://www.example.com/projects/index.html` (or even just `https://www.example.com/projects/`, as most web servers just look for a landing page such as `index.html` to load if it isn't specified in the URL.)

An absolute URL will always point to the same location, no matter where it's used.

**Relative URL**: Points to a location that is _relative_ to the file you are linking from, more like what we looked at in the previous section.
For example, if we wanted to link from our example file at `https://www.example.com/projects/index.html` to a PDF file in the same directory, the URL would just be the filename — `project-brief.pdf` — no extra information needed. If the PDF was available in a subdirectory inside `projects` called `pdfs`, the relative link would be `pdfs/project-brief.pdf` (the equivalent absolute URL would be `https://www.example.com/projects/pdfs/project-brief.pdf`.)

A relative URL will point to different places depending on the actual location of the file you refer from — for example if we moved our `index.html` file out of the `projects` directory and into the **root** of the website (the top level, not in any directories), the `pdfs/project-brief.pdf` relative URL link inside it would now point to a file located at `https://www.example.com/pdfs/project-brief.pdf`, not a file located at `https://www.example.com/projects/pdfs/project-brief.pdf`.

Of course, the location of the `project-brief.pdf` file and `pdfs` folder won't suddenly change because you moved the `index.html` file — this would make your link point to the wrong place, so it wouldn't work if clicked on. You need to be careful!

## Link best practices

There are some best practices to follow when writing links. Let's look at these now.

### Use clear link wording

It's easy to throw links up on your page. That's not enough. We need to make our links _accessible_ to all readers, regardless of their current context and which tools they prefer. For example:

- Screen reader users like jumping around from link to link on the page, and reading links out of context.
- Search engines use link text to index target files, so it is a good idea to include keywords in your link text to effectively describe what is being linked to.
- Visual readers skim over the page rather than reading every word, and their eyes will be drawn to page features that stand out, like links. They will find descriptive link text useful.

Let's look at a specific example:

**Good** link text: [Download Firefox](https://www.firefox.com/en-US/?redirect_source=firefox-com)

```html example-good
<p><a href="https://www.firefox.com/en-US/">Download Firefox</a></p>
```

<!-- markdownlint-disable descriptive-link-text -->

**Bad** link text: [Click here](https://www.firefox.com/en-US/) to download Firefox

```html example-bad
<p>
  <a href="https://www.firefox.com/en-US/">Click here</a> to download Firefox
</p>
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable descriptive-link-text -->

Other tips:

- Don't repeat the URL as part of the link text — URLs look ugly, and sound even uglier when a screen reader reads them out letter by letter.
- Don't say "link" or "links to" in the link text — it's just noise. Screen readers tell people there's a link.
  Visual users will also know there's a link, because links are generally styled in a different color and underlined (this convention generally shouldn't be broken, as users are used to it).
- Keep your link text as short as possible — this is helpful because screen readers need to interpret the entire link text.
- Minimize instances where multiple copies of the same text are linked to different places.
  This can cause problems for screen reader users, if there's a list of links out of context that are labeled "click here", "click here", "click here".

### Linking to non-HTML resources — leave clear signposts

When linking to a resource that will not be opened in the current page as a "normal navigation", you should add clear wording to the link text about what is going to happen. For example, if you're downloading or streaming a resource, or if the link is going to open a popup or perform some other potentially unexpected effect, this should be stated in the text. This is important for users on low bandwidth connections, who might want to avoid downloading assets of multiple megabytes. It also helps to set up expectations for screen reader users, who may not be aware of what's happening otherwise.

Let's look at some examples, to see what kind of text can be used here:

```html
<p>
  <a href="/large-report.pdf" download>
    Download the sales report (PDF, 10MB)
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.example.com/video-stream/" target="_blank">
    Watch the video (stream opens in separate tab, HD quality)
  </a>
</p>
```

### Use the download attribute when linking to a download

When you are linking to a resource that's to be downloaded rather than opened in the browser, you can use the `download` attribute to provide a default save filename. Here's an example with a download link to the latest Windows version of Firefox:

```html
<a
  href="https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-latest-ssl&os=win64&lang=en-US"
  download="firefox-latest-64bit-installer.exe">
  Download Latest Firefox for Windows (64-bit) (English, US)
</a>
```

### When to open links in a new tab

Links by default open in the same tab as the page they are on, which allows the user to navigate back to the previous page using the browser's back button. However, many sites (including MDN) choose to open certain links, especially external links, in a new tab. This is done by setting the [`target`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/a#target) attribute to `"_blank"`.

```html
Firefox is developed by the
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">Mozilla Foundation</a>.
```

Whether or not to open links in a new tab should be a conscious decision, based on user experience design considerations. Here are some things to think about:

- Opening links in a new tab presents the two documents simultaneously, which is useful for a "parallel" navigation experience. On the other hand, links that open in the same tab are more like a continuation of the current page.
- Opening links in a new tab can be disorienting for users who are accustomed to using the back button.
- Even when links are opened in the same tab by default, users can still choose to open them in a new tab, using keyboard shortcuts or context menu options. On the other hand, links that open in a new tab are hard to open in the same tab.
- Screen reader users may be confused by links that open in a new tab, as they may not realize that the new tab has opened, and they may lose context about their location on the page.

A common approach is to open external links in new tabs and internal links in the same tab.
Some designers prefer to open all links in the same tab.
If you do open links in new tabs, then it is recommended that you provide cues for these links, such as an icon next to the link text.

## Creating a navigation menu

For this exercise, we'd like you to link some pages together with a navigation menu to create a multipage website. This is one common way in which a website is created — the same page structure is used on every page, including the same navigation menu, so when links are clicked it gives the impression that you are staying in the same place, and different content is being brought up.

You'll need to make local copies of the following four pages, all in the same directory. For a complete file list, see the [navigation-menu-start](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/tree/main/html/introduction-to-html/navigation-menu-start) directory:

- [index.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/introduction-to-html/navigation-menu-start/index.html)
- [projects.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/introduction-to-html/navigation-menu-start/projects.html)
- [pictures.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/introduction-to-html/navigation-menu-start/pictures.html)
- [social.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/introduction-to-html/navigation-menu-start/social.html)

You should:

1. Add an unordered list in the indicated place on one page that includes the names of the pages to link to.
   A navigation menu is usually just a list of links, so this is semantically OK.
2. Change each page name into a link to that page.
3. Copy the navigation menu across to each page.
4. On each page, remove just the link to that same page — it's confusing and unnecessary for a page to include a link to itself.
   And, the lack of a link acts a good visual reminder of which page you are currently on.

The finished example should look similar to the following page:

![An example of a simple HTML navigation menu, with home, pictures, projects, and social menu items](navigation-example.png)

> [!NOTE]
> If you get stuck, or aren't sure if you have got it right, you can check the [navigation-menu-marked-up](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/tree/main/html/introduction-to-html/navigation-menu-marked-up) directory to see the correct answer.

## Email links

It's possible to create links or buttons that, when clicked, open a new outgoing email message rather than linking to a resource or page.
This is done using the {{HTMLElement("a")}} element and the `mailto:` URL scheme.

In its most basic and commonly used form, a `mailto:` link indicates the email address of the intended recipient. For example:

```html
<a href="mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org">Send email to nowhere</a>
```

This results in a link that looks like this: [Send email to nowhere](mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org).

In fact, the email address is optional. If you omit it and your [`href`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/a#href) is "mailto:", a new outgoing email window will be opened by the user's email client with no destination address.
This is often useful as "Share" links that users can click to send an email to an address of their choosing.

### Specifying details

In addition to the email address, you can provide other information. In fact, any standard mail header fields can be added to the `mailto` URL you provide.
The most commonly used of these are "subject", "cc", and "body" (which is not a true header field, but allows you to specify a short content message for the new email).
Each field and its value is specified as a query term.

Here's an example that includes a cc, bcc, subject and body:

```html
<a
  href="mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org?cc=name2@rapidtables.com&bcc=name3@rapidtables.com&subject=The%20subject%20of%20the%20email&body=The%20body%20of%20the%20email">
  Send mail with cc, bcc, subject and body
</a>
```

> [!NOTE]
> The values of each field must be URL-encoded with non-printing characters (invisible characters like tabs, carriage returns, and page breaks) and spaces {{Glossary("Percent-encoding", "percent-escaped")}}.
> Also, note the use of the question mark (`?`) to separate the main URL from the field values, and ampersands (&) to separate each field in the `mailto:` URL.
> This is standard URL query notation.
> Read [The GET method](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data#the_get_method) to understand what URL query notation is more commonly used for.

Here are a few other sample `mailto` URLs:

- <mailto:>
- <mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org>
- <mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org,nobody@mozilla.org>
- <mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org?cc=nobody@mozilla.org>
- <mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org?cc=nobody@mozilla.org&subject=This%20is%20the%20subject>

## Summary

That's it for links, for now anyway! You'll return to links later on in the course when you start to look at styling them. Next up, we'll give you some tests that you can use to check how well you've understood and retained the information we've provided on links.

## Debugging isn't scary

When writing code of some kind, everything is fine, until that dreaded moment when an error occurs — you've done something wrong, so your code doesn't work — either not at all, or not quite how you wanted it to. For example, the following shows an error reported when trying to {{glossary("compile")}} a simple program written in the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) language.

![A console window showing the result of trying to compile a rust program with a missing quote around a string in a print statement. The error message reported is error: unterminated double quote string.](error-message.png)

Here, the error message is relatively easy to understand — "unterminated double quote string". If you look at the listing, you can probably see how `println!(Hello, world!");` might logically be missing a double quote. However, error messages can quickly get more complicated and less easy to interpret as programs get bigger, and even simple cases can look a little intimidating to someone who doesn't know anything about Rust.

Debugging doesn't have to be scary though — the key to being comfortable with writing and debugging any code is familiarity with both the language and the associated tools.

## HTML and debugging

HTML is not as complicated to understand as Rust. HTML is not compiled into a different form before parsing (it is _interpreted_, not _compiled_). And HTML's {{glossary("element")}} syntax is arguably a lot easier to understand than a "real programming language" like Rust, {{glossary("JavaScript")}}, or {{glossary("Python")}}.

The way that browsers parse HTML is a lot more **permissive** than how most programming languages are parsed, which is both a good and a bad thing.

But first of all, what do we mean by permissive? Well, generally when you do something wrong in code, there are two main types of error that you'll come across:

- **Syntax errors**: These are typos in your code that cause the program not to run, like the Rust error shown earlier. These are usually easy to fix as long as you are familiar with the language's syntax and know what the error messages mean.
- **Logic errors**: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct, but the code is not doing what you intended it to, meaning that the program runs incorrectly. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.

HTML itself doesn't suffer from syntax errors because browsers parse it permissively, meaning that the page still displays even if there are syntax errors in the source code. Browsers have built-in rules to state how to interpret incorrectly-written HTML markup (often called **invalid** or **badly-formed** markup), changing it automatically to some valid markup.

For example, the following HTML snippet contains incorrectly nested elements:

```html example-bad
<p>I didn't expect to find the <em>next-door neighbor's <strong>cat</em></strong> here!</p>
```

The closing `</strong>` tag should be before the closing `</em>` tag, but it is not — it is after it.

If you load this HTML into a browser then look at the [rendered DOM](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Web_standards/How_browsers_load_websites#handling_html), you'll see that the nesting has been corrected by the browser:

```html example-good
<p>
  I didn't expect to find the
  <em>next-door neighbor's <strong>cat</strong></em> here!
</p>
```

So why is this both good and bad? Well, in this case the browser has created the intended result, but as you'll see [later on](#your_turn_studying_html_using_the_dom_inspector), this is not always the case. You'll always get _something_ running, but the browser doesn't always get it right, which can cause problems. It is better to write correct markup in the first place.

> [!NOTE]
> HTML is parsed permissively because when the web was first created, it was decided that getting content published was more important than making sure the syntax was absolutely correct. The web would probably not be as popular as it is today if it had been more strict from the very beginning.

So how do you find markup errors? Later on we will show you how to find errors in HTML using a tool called the [HTML validator](#html_validation), but first we will show you how to inspect your HTML manually using a **DOM inspector**, and then explore what kinds of markup errors you might be looking for, and how the browser might interpret those.

## Using the DOM inspector

All modern browsers have a set of [developer tools](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools) (devtools) built into them, which provide a set of functionality for examining the webpage loaded into the current tab. These can show you what HTML is rendered in the page, what CSS is applied to each DOM node, what JavaScript is running in the page, and more. They also allow you to edit the currently-running code and see the effect live on the page.

You can open the devtools in a similar way in each browser — see [How to open the devtools in your browser](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools#how_to_open_the_devtools_in_your_browser) to learn how.

For this article, the only relevant devtools function is the **DOM inspector**, which shows the currently-rendered HTML DOM and allows you to edit it. Let's look at this now:

1. Open the devtools in your browser.
2. Open the DOM inspector. It is in the same place in each browser — the first tab in the devtools at the start of the row. In Firefox it is labelled _Inspector_, while in Safari, Edge, and Chrome it is labeled _Elements_. This should be the tab selected by default when you first open the devtools, but select it if it isn't.
3. Examine the DOM tree structure shown in the tab, and note how you can click the little expansion arrows at the start of each DOM node to expand and collapse them and reveal their descendant nodes. You can also use the up and down cursor keys to move up and down the nodes, and the right and left cursor keys to expand and collapse the nodes.
4. Also try hovering over the nodes (or selecting them with the cursor keys) and note how the currently-hovered (or selected) element is highlighted in the viewport.
5. You can also edit the rendered DOM. We won't use the editing functionality in this article, but take some time to look up how to do this if you are curious.

## Your turn: Studying HTML using the DOM inspector

In this section, you'll study some code using the DOM inspector and see how the browser handles common markup errors.

1. First, save the following HTML file listing as `debug-example.html`, somewhere on your local machine. This demo is deliberately written with some built-in errors for us to explore.

   ```html-nolint
   <!doctype html>
   <html lang="en-US">
     <head>
       <meta charset="utf-8">
       <title>HTML debugging examples</title>
     </head>

     <body>
       <h1>HTML debugging examples</h1>
       <p>What causes errors in HTML?
       <ul>
         <li>Unclosed elements: If an element is <strong>not closed properly,then its effect can spread to areas you didn't intend
         <li>Badly nested elements: Nesting elements properly is also very important for code behaving correctly. <strong>strong <em>strong emphasized?</strong> what is this?</em>
         <li>Unclosed attributes: Another common source of HTML problems. Let's look at an example: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/>link to Mozilla homepage</a>
       </ul>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

2. Next, open it in a browser. You will see something like this:![A simple HTML document with a title of HTML debugging examples, and some information about common HTML errors, such as unclosed elements, badly nested elements, and unclosed attributes. ](badly-formed-html.png)
3. This immediately doesn't look great; let's look at the source code to see if we can work out why (only the body contents are shown):

   ```html
   <h1>HTML debugging examples</h1>

   <p>What causes errors in HTML?

   <ul>
     <li>Unclosed elements: If an element is <strong>not closed properly,
         then its effect can spread to areas you didn't intend

     <li>Badly nested elements: Nesting elements properly is also very important
         for code behaving correctly. <strong>strong <em>strong emphasized?</strong>
         what is this?</em>

     <li>Unclosed attributes: Another common source of HTML problems. Let's
         look at an example: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/>link to Mozilla
         homepage</a>
   </ul>
   ```

4. Let's review the problems:
   - The {{htmlelement("p","paragraph")}} and {{htmlelement("li","list item")}} elements have no closing tags. Looking at the image above, this doesn't seem to have affected the markup rendering too badly, as it is easy to infer where one element should end and another should begin.
   - The first {{htmlelement("strong")}} element has no closing tag. This is a bit more problematic, as it isn't easy to tell where the element is supposed to end. In fact, the whole of the rest of the text has been rendered in bold.
   - This section is badly nested: `<strong>strong <em>strong emphasized?</strong> what is this?</em>`. It is not easy to tell how this has been interpreted because of the previous problem.
   - The [`href`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/a#href) attribute value is missing a closing double quote. This seems to have caused the biggest problem — the link has not been rendered at all.

5. Now let's examine the rendered DOM, as opposed to the source code. To do this, open your browser's DOM inspector. You will see a representation of the rendered markup: ![The HTML inspector in Firefox, with our example's paragraph highlighted, showing the text "What causes errors in HTML?" Here you can see that the paragraph element has been closed by the browser.](html-inspector.png)
6. Look at how the browser has tried to fix our HTML errors (we did the review in Firefox; other modern browsers _should_ give the same result):
   - The paragraphs and list items have been given closing tags.
   - It isn't clear where the first `<strong>` element should be closed, so the browser has wrapped each separate block of text in its own `<strong>` element, right down to the bottom of the document!
   - The incorrect nesting has been fixed by the browser as shown here:

     ```html
     <strong>
       strong
       <em>strong emphasized?</em>
     </strong>
     <em> what is this?</em>
     ```

   - The link with the missing double quote has been deleted altogether. The last list item looks like this:

     ```html
     <li>
       <strong>
         Unclosed attributes: Another common source of HTML problems. Let's look
         at an example:
       </strong>
     </li>
     ```

## HTML validation

You can see from the above example that you really want to make sure your HTML is well-formed! But how? In a small example like the one seen above, it is easy to search through the lines and find the errors, but what about a huge, complex HTML document?

The tool for this job is the [Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) (or **HTML validator**), which is created and maintained by the W3C (which you learned about in [The web standards model](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Web_standards/The_web_standards_model)). The validator takes an HTML document as an input, goes through it, and gives you a report to tell you what is wrong with your HTML.

![The HTML validator homepage](validator.png)

To specify the HTML to validate, you can provide a web address, upload an HTML file, or directly input some HTML code.

## Validating an HTML document

In this task, we'll get you to try out the HTML validator. You will validate our [sample document](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/introduction-to-html/debugging-html/debug-example.html) and see what results are returned. This example contains the same HTML that you studied with the DOM inspector earlier.

1. First, load the [Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) in a new browser tab, if it isn't already open.
2. Switch to the [Validate by Direct Input](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) tab.
3. Copy all of the sample document's code (not just the body) and paste it into the large text area shown in the Markup Validation Service.
4. Press the _Check_ button.

This should give you a list of errors and other information.

![A list of HTML validation results from the W3C markup validation service](validation-results.png)

### Interpreting the error messages

The error messages are usually helpful, but sometimes they are not so easy to understand. With a bit of practice, you can work out how to interpret these to fix your code. Let's go through the error messages and see what they mean. You'll see that each message comes with a line and column number to help you to locate the error easily.

- "End tag `li` implied, but there were open elements" (2 instances): These messages indicate that an element is open that should be closed. The ending tag is implied, but not actually there. The line/column information points to the first line after the line where the closing tag should really be, but this is a good enough clue to see what is wrong.
- "Unclosed element `strong`": This is easier to understand — a {{htmlelement("strong")}} element is unclosed, and the line/column information points right to where it is.
- "End tag `strong` violates nesting rules": This points out the incorrectly nested elements, and the line/column information points out where they are.
- "End of file reached when inside an attribute value. Ignoring tag": This one is rather cryptic; it refers to the fact that there is an attribute value not properly formed somewhere, possibly near the end of the file because the end of the file appears inside the attribute value. The fact that the browser doesn't render the link should give us a good clue as to what element is at fault.
- "End of file seen and there were open elements": This is a bit ambiguous, but basically refers to the fact there are open elements that need to be properly closed. The line numbers point to the last few lines of the file, and this error message comes with a line of code that points out an example of an open element:

  ```plain
  example: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/>link to Mozilla homepage</a> ↩ </ul>↩ </body>↩</html>
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > An attribute missing a closing quote can result in an open element because the rest of the document is interpreted as the attribute's content.

- "Unclosed element `ul`": This is not very helpful, as the {{htmlelement("ul")}} element _is_ closed correctly. This error occurs because the {{htmlelement("a")}} element is not closed, due to the missing closing quote mark.

If you can't work out what every error message means, don't worry about it. A good strategy is to fix a few errors at a time, then revalidate your HTML after each set of fixes to show what errors are left. Sometimes, fixing an earlier error will also get rid of other error messages — several errors can often be caused by a single problem, in a domino effect.

You will know when all your errors are fixed when you see a nice little green banner telling you there are no errors to report. At the time of writing, it said "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show."

## Summary

So there we have it, an introduction to debugging HTML, which should give you some useful skills to count on when debugging HTML, but also CSS and JavaScript code later on in the course. This also marks the end of the _Structuring content with HTML_ module.

## What are emphasis and importance?

In human language, we often emphasize certain words to alter the meaning of a sentence, and we often want to mark certain words as important or different in some way. HTML provides various semantic elements to allow us to mark up textual content with such effects, and in this section, we'll look at a few of the most common ones.

### Emphasis

When we want to add emphasis in spoken language, we _stress_ certain words, subtly altering the meaning of what we are saying. Similarly, in written language we tend to stress words by putting them in italics. For example, the following two sentences have different meanings.

> I am glad you weren't late.
>
> I am _glad_ you weren't _late_.

The first sentence sounds genuinely relieved that the person wasn't late. In contrast, the second one, with both the words "glad" and "late" in italics, sounds sarcastic or passive-aggressive, expressing annoyance that the person arrived a bit late.

In HTML we use the {{htmlelement("em")}} (emphasis) element to mark up such instances. As well as making the document more interesting to read, these are recognized by screen readers, which can be configured to speak them in a different tone of voice. Browsers style this as italic by default, but you shouldn't use this tag purely to get italic styling. To do that, you'd use a {{htmlelement("span")}} element and some CSS, or perhaps an {{htmlelement("i")}} element (see below).

```html
<p>I am <em>glad</em> you weren't <em>late</em>.</p>
```

### Strong importance

To emphasize important words, we tend to stress them in spoken language and **bold** them in written language. For example:

> This liquid is **highly toxic**.
>
> I am counting on you. **Do not** be late!

In HTML we use the {{htmlelement("strong")}} (strong importance) element to mark up such instances. As well as making the document more useful, again these are recognized by screen readers, which can be configured to speak them in a different tone of voice. Browsers style this as bold text by default, but you shouldn't use this tag purely to get bold styling. To do that, you'd use a {{htmlelement("span")}} element and some CSS, or perhaps a {{htmlelement("b")}} element (see below).

```html
<p>This liquid is <strong>highly toxic</strong>.</p>

<p>I am counting on you. <strong>Do not</strong> be late!</p>
```

You can nest strong and emphasis inside one another if desired:

```html-nolint
<p>This liquid is <strong>highly toxic</strong> — if you drink it, <strong>you may <em>die</em></strong>.</p>
```

## Let's play with emphasis and importance

In this section, we want you to play with emphasis and importance:

1. Click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.
2. In the main heading give the word "Emphasis" emphasis, and the word "importance" strong importance.
3. In the first paragraph, give the coffee machine name strong importance, and emphasize the adjectives used to describe the coffee.
4. In the second paragraph, give the temperature description ("cold") and the action you should take ("wrap up warm to avoid falling ill") strong importance. Give "falling ill" some extra markup so it is both emphasized and important.

If you make a mistake, you can clear your work using the _Reset_ button in the MDN Playground. If you get really stuck, you can view the solution below the code block.

```css hidden live-sample___emphasis_importance
h1 {
  font-weight: normal;
}
```

```html live-sample___emphasis_importance
<h1>Emphasis and importance</h1>

<p>
  My new coffee machine is called The Percolator 2000. It produces the most
  sublime and wonderful brew.
</p>

<p>
  In the dead of winter, it will be cold. You should wrap up warm to avoid
  falling ill.
</p>
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('emphasis_importance', "100%", 160) }}

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

Your finished HTML should look like this:

```html
<h1><em>Emphasis</em> and <strong>importance</strong></h1>

<p>
  My new coffee machine is called <strong>The Percolator 2000</strong>. It
  produces the most <em>sublime</em> and <em>wonderful</em> brew.
</p>

<p>
  In the dead of winter, it will be <strong>cold</strong>. You should
  <strong>wrap up warm to avoid <em>falling ill</em></strong
  >.
</p>
```

</details>

## Italic, bold, underline…

The elements we've discussed so far have clear-cut associated semantics. The situation with {{htmlelement("b")}}, {{htmlelement("i")}}, and {{htmlelement("u")}} is somewhat more complicated. They came about so people could write bold, italics, or underlined text in an era when CSS was still supported poorly or not at all. Elements like this, which only affect presentation and not semantics, are known as **presentational elements** and should no longer be used because, as we've seen before, semantics is so important to accessibility, SEO, etc.

HTML5 redefined `<b>`, `<i>`, and `<u>` with new, somewhat confusing, semantic roles.

Here's the best rule you can remember: It's only appropriate to use `<b>`, `<i>`, or `<u>` to convey a meaning traditionally conveyed with bold, italics, or underline when there isn't a more suitable element; and there usually is. Consider whether `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<mark>`, or `<span>` might be more appropriate.

Always keep an accessibility mindset. The concept of italics isn't very helpful to people using screen readers, or to people using a writing system other than the Latin alphabet.

- {{HTMLElement('i')}} is used to convey a meaning traditionally conveyed by italic: foreign words, taxonomic designation, technical terms, a thought…
- {{HTMLElement('b')}} is used to convey a meaning traditionally conveyed by bold: keywords, product names, lead sentence…
- {{HTMLElement('u')}} is used to convey a meaning traditionally conveyed by underline: proper name, misspelling…

> [!NOTE]
> People strongly associate underlining with hyperlinks. Therefore, on the web, it's best to only underline links. Use the `<u>` element when it's semantically appropriate, but consider using CSS to change the default underline to something more appropriate on the web. The example below illustrates how it can be done.

<!-- cSpell:ignore spel -->

```html
<!-- scientific names -->
<p>
  The Ruby-throated Hummingbird (<i>Archilochus colubris</i>) is the most common
  hummingbird in Eastern North America.
</p>

<!-- foreign words -->
<p>
  The menu was a sea of exotic words like <i lang="uk-latn">vatrushka</i>,
  <i lang="id">nasi goreng</i> and <i lang="fr">soupe à l'oignon</i>.
</p>

<!-- a known misspelling -->
<p>Someday I'll learn how to <u class="spelling-error">spel</u> better.</p>

<!-- term being defined when used in a definition -->
<dl>
  <dt>Semantic HTML</dt>
  <dd>
    Use the elements based on their <b>semantic</b> meaning, not their
    appearance.
  </dd>
</dl>
```

## Project brief

We'd like you to imagine that you have just been to stay at a hotel called the little house in the woods (well, at least you thought it was a hotel). We want you to help us create a fictional feedback form for the hotel. As well as marking up the required features and structuring the form, there are a few additional HTML features we want you to implement.

### Implementing form controls

1. In the "Facilities" section, we want you to turn the first two sets of lines into sets of radio buttons plus a label to describe each one and a legend describing the whole group. Add an attribute to make the first radio button in each case selected by default.
2. In the "Facilities" section, turn the third set of lines into a set of checkboxes, with a label to describe each one and a legend describing the whole group.
3. In the "About your hosts" section, turn both sets of lines into a drop-down menu of options, with a label to describe each one.
4. In the "Any other feedback?" section, add a multi-line text entry box and turn the existing line into its descriptive label.
5. In the "Your details" section, add a suitable type of text input to collect each of the three listed values. Turn the existing lines into their labels.
6. Turn "Submit" into a submit button for the form.

### Structuring the form

1. Wrap the form in a suitable wrapper element to specify the whole thing as a form.
2. Add repeating structural elements inside the form, to wrap each form section. Give each form section element a `class` of `form-section`. To make things easier, each form section is surrounded by two sets of double-hyphens (`--`). You can remove the double-hyphens when you've added your structural elements.
3. You'll need to include additional structural elements around some of the control/label pairs to make them sit on their own separate lines. Add these now, giving each one a `class` of `separator`.
4. Add a line break element between the multi-line text entry box and its label to make the two sit on separate lines.

### Additional HTML features

1. There are several headings in the text that need marking up with suitable elements:
   1. The top level-heading: "We want your feedback!".
   2. Second level headings: "Facilities", "About your hosts", "Any other feedback?", and "Your details".
2. The opening paragraph below the top-level heading needs to be marked up appropriately.
3. Also in the opening paragraph, turn the text "little house in the woods" and "prize draw" into links. We don't have pages to link to yet, so for now, just set the target URL as `#` for a placeholder.
4. We want you to place a wide, flat image below the opening paragraph as a decoration. The image path is `https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/learn/woodland-strip.jpg`, and we'd like you to set the alternative text for it to an empty value, given that it is decorative only.
5. Following on from the previous point, as a stretch goal, research a better way to include the decorative image on the page, and have a go at doing so (this involves a different technology to HTML, which we haven't touched on in this module).

## Hints and tips

- Use the [W3C HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to catch unintended mistakes in your HTML — so that you can fix them.
- If you are getting stuck and can't envisage what elements to put where, draw out a simple block diagram of the page layout, and write on the elements you think should wrap each block. This is extremely helpful.

## Example

The following screenshot shows an example of what the form might look like after being marked up. If you are getting stuck on how to achieve some of this, see the solution below the live example.

For the stretch goal, arguably a better way to add decorative images to a web page is using [CSS background images](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Backgrounds_and_borders#background_images). Delete the `<img>` element and use the CSS {{cssxref("background")}} property to place the image on the page instead. A good element to place the background image on would be the `<form>` element, and you need to tell the browser not to repeat the image. You also need to provide some {{cssxref("margin")}} and {{cssxref("padding")}} to space out the background image so it doesn't overlap the text.

```css
form {
  background: url("https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/learn/woodland-strip.jpg")
    no-repeat;
  margin-top: 20px;
  padding-top: 50px;
}
```

# From object to iframe — general embedding technologies

Developers commonly think of embedding media such as images, video and audio into web pages. In this article we take somewhat of a sideways step, looking at some elements that allow you to embed a wide variety of content types into your webpages: the {{htmlelement("iframe")}}, {{htmlelement("embed")}} and {{htmlelement("object")}} elements. `<iframe>`s are for embedding other web pages, and the other two allow you to embed external resources such as PDF files.

## A short history of embedding

A long time ago on the Web, it was popular to use **frames** to create websites — small parts of a website stored in individual HTML pages. These were embedded in a master document called a **frameset**, which allowed you to specify the area on the screen that each frame filled, rather like sizing the columns and rows of a table. These were considered the height of coolness in the mid to late 90s, and there was evidence that having a webpage split up into smaller chunks like this was better for download speeds — especially noticeable with network connections being so slow back then. They did however have many problems, which far outweighed any positives as network speeds got faster, so you don't see them being used anymore.

A little while later (late 90s, early 2000s), plugin technologies became very popular, such as [Java Applets](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Java) and [Flash](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Adobe_Flash) — these allowed web developers to embed rich content into webpages such as videos and animations, which just weren't available through HTML alone. Embedding these technologies was achieved through elements like {{htmlelement("object")}}, and the lesser-used {{htmlelement("embed")}}, and they were very useful at the time. They have since fallen out of fashion due to many problems, including accessibility, security, file size, and more. These days major browsers have stopped supporting plugins such as Flash.

Finally, the {{htmlelement("iframe")}} element appeared (along with other ways of embedding content, such as {{htmlelement("canvas")}}, {{htmlelement("video")}}, etc.) This provides a way to embed an entire web document inside another one, as if it were an {{htmlelement("img")}} or other such element, and is used regularly today.

With the history lesson out of the way, let's move on and see how to use some of these.

## Playing with classic embedding uses

In this article we are going to jump straight into an exercise, to immediately give you an idea of what embedding technologies are useful for. The online world is very familiar with [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), but many people don't know about some of the sharing facilities it has available.

1. First of all, open the [MDN Playground](/en-US/play).
2. Now we'll look at how YouTube allows us to embed a video in any page we like using an {{htmlelement("iframe")}}.
   1. Go to YouTube and find a video you like.
   2. Below the video, you'll find a _Share_ button — select this to display the sharing options.
   3. Select the _Embed_ button and you'll be given some `<iframe>` code — copy this.
   4. Paste it into the _HTML_ pane in the Playground, and see what the result is in the output.
3. For bonus points, you could also try embedding a [Google Map](https://www.google.com/maps/) in the Playground:
   1. Go to Google Maps and find a map you like.
   2. Click on the "hamburger menu" (three horizontal lines) in the top left of the UI.
   3. Select the _Share or embed map_ option.
   4. Select the _Embed a map_ option, which will give you some `<iframe>` code — copy it.
   5. Paste it into the _HTML_ pane in the Playground, and see what the result is in the output.

If you make a mistake, you can always reset it using the _Reset_ button in the Playground.

## iframes in detail

So, that was easy and fun, right? {{htmlelement("iframe")}} elements are designed to allow you to embed other web documents into the current document. This is great for incorporating third-party content into your website that you might not have direct control over and don't want to have to implement your own version of — such as video from online video providers, commenting systems like [Disqus](https://disqus.com/), maps from online map providers, advertising banners, etc. Even the live editable examples you've been using through this course are implemented using `<iframe>`s.

Before diving into using `<iframe>` elements, there are some security concerns to be aware of.
Say you wanted to include the MDN glossary on one of your web pages using the {{htmlelement("iframe")}} element, you might try something like the next code example.
If you were to add the code below into one of your pages, you might be surprised to see an error message instead of the glossary page:

```html
<iframe
  src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary"
  width="100%"
  height="500"
  allowfullscreen
  sandbox>
  <p>
    <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary">
      Fallback link for browsers that don't support iframes
    </a>
  </p>
</iframe>
```

```css
iframe {
  border: none;
}
```

If you have a look at your browser's console, you'll see an error message like the following:

```plain
Refused to display 'https://developer.mozilla.org/' in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'deny'.
```

The [Security](#security_concerns) section below goes into more detail about why you see this error, but first, let's have a look at what our code is doing.

The example includes the bare essentials needed to use an `<iframe>`:

- [`border: none`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border)
  - : If used, the `<iframe>` is displayed without a surrounding border. Otherwise, by default, browsers display the `<iframe>` with a surrounding border (which is generally undesirable).
- [`allowfullscreen`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/iframe#allowfullscreen)
  - : If set, the `<iframe>` is able to be placed in fullscreen mode using the [Fullscreen API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fullscreen_API) (somewhat beyond the scope of this article).
- [`src`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/iframe#src)
  - : This attribute, as with {{htmlelement("video")}}/{{htmlelement("img")}}, contains a path pointing to the URL of the document to be embedded.
- [`width`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/iframe#width) and [`height`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/iframe#height)
  - : These attributes specify the width and height you want the iframe to be.
- [`sandbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/iframe#sandbox)
  - : This attribute, which works in slightly more modern browsers than the rest of the `<iframe>` features (e.g., IE 10 and above) requests heightened security settings; we'll say more about this in the next section.

> [!NOTE]
> In order to improve speed, it's a good idea to set the iframe's `src` attribute with JavaScript after the main content is done with loading. This makes your page usable sooner and decreases your official page load time (an important {{glossary("SEO")}} metric.)

### Security concerns

Above we mentioned security concerns — let's go into this in a bit more detail now. We are not expecting you to understand all of this content perfectly the first time; we just want to make you aware of this concern, and provide a reference to come back to as you get more experienced and start considering using `<iframe>`s in your experiments and work. Also, there is no need to be scared and not use `<iframe>`s — you just need to be careful. Read on…

Browser makers and Web developers have learned the hard way that iframes are a common target (official term: **attack vector**) for bad people on the Web (often termed **hackers**, or more accurately, **crackers**) to attack if they are trying to maliciously modify your webpage, or trick people into doing something they don't want to do, such as reveal sensitive information like usernames and passwords. Because of this, spec engineers and browser developers have developed various security mechanisms for making `<iframe>`s more secure, and there are also best practices to consider — we'll cover some of these below.

> [!NOTE]
> [Clickjacking](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/Clickjacking) is one kind of common iframe attack where hackers embed an invisible iframe into your document (or embed your document into their own malicious website) and use it to capture users' interactions. This is a common way to mislead users or steal sensitive data.

A quick example first though — try loading the previous example we showed above into your browser — you can [find it live on GitHub](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/multimedia-and-embedding/other-embedding-technologies/iframe-detail.html) ([see the source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/other-embedding-technologies/iframe-detail.html) too.) Instead of the page you expected, you'll probably see some kind of message to the effect of "I can't open this page", and if you look at the _Console_ in the [browser developer tools](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools), you'll see a message telling you why. In Firefox, you'll get told something like _The loading of "https\://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary" in a frame is denied by "X-Frame-Options" directive set to "DENY"_. This is because the developers that built MDN have included a setting on the server that serves the website pages to disallow them from being embedded inside `<iframe>`s (see [Configure CSP directives](#configure_csp_directives), below.) This makes sense — an entire MDN page doesn't really make sense to be embedded in other pages unless you want to do something like embed them on your site and claim them as your own — or attempt to steal data via [clickjacking](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/Clickjacking), which are both really bad things to do. Plus if everybody started to do this, all the additional bandwidth would start to cost Mozilla a lot of money.

#### Only embed when necessary

Sometimes it makes sense to embed third-party content — like youtube videos and maps — but you can save yourself a lot of headaches if you only embed third-party content when completely necessary. A good rule for web security is _"You can never be too cautious. If you made it, double-check it anyway. If someone else made it, assume it's dangerous until proven otherwise."_

Besides security, you should also be aware of intellectual property issues. Most content is copyrighted, offline and online, even content you might not expect (for example, most images on [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)). Never display content on your webpage unless you own it or the owners have given you written, unequivocal permission. Penalties for copyright infringement are severe. Again, you can never be too cautious.

If the content is licensed, you must obey the license terms. For example, the content on MDN is [licensed under CC-BY-SA](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Attrib_copyright_license#documentation). That means, you must [credit us properly](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Best_practices_for_attribution) when you quote our content, even if you make substantial changes.

#### Use HTTPS

{{Glossary("HTTPS")}} is the encrypted version of {{Glossary("HTTP")}}. You should serve your websites using HTTPS whenever possible:

1. HTTPS reduces the chance that remote content has been tampered with in transit.
2. HTTPS prevents embedded content from accessing content in your parent document, and vice versa.

HTTPS-enabling your site requires a special security certificate to be installed. Many hosting providers offer HTTPS-enabled hosting without you needing to do any setup on your own to put a certificate in place. But if you _do_ need to set up HTTPS support for your site on your own, [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) provides tools and instructions you can use for automatically creating and installing the necessary certificate — with built-in support for the most widely-used web servers, including the Apache web server, Nginx, and others. The Let's Encrypt tooling is designed to make the process as easy as possible, so there's really no good reason to avoid using it or other available means to HTTPS-enable your site.

> [!NOTE]
> [GitHub pages](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/Using_GitHub_pages) allow content to be served via HTTPS by default.
> If you are using a different hosting provider you should check what support they provide for serving content with HTTPS.

#### Always use the `sandbox` attribute

You want to give attackers as little power as you can to do bad things on your website, therefore you should give embedded content _only the permissions needed for doing its job._ Of course, this applies to your own content, too. A container for code where it can be used appropriately — or for testing — but can't cause any harm to the rest of the codebase (either accidental or malicious) is called a [sandbox](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)>).

Content that's not sandboxed may be able to execute JavaScript, submit forms, trigger popup windows, etc. By default, you should impose all available restrictions by using the `sandbox` attribute with no parameters, as shown in our previous example.

If absolutely required, you can add permissions back one by one (inside the `sandbox=""` attribute value) — see the [`sandbox`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/iframe#sandbox) reference entry for all the available options. One important note is that you should _never_ add both `allow-scripts` and `allow-same-origin` to your `sandbox` attribute — in that case, the embedded content could bypass the [Same-origin policy](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Same-origin_policy) that stops sites from executing scripts, and use JavaScript to turn off sandboxing altogether.

> [!NOTE]
> Sandboxing provides no protection if attackers can fool people into visiting malicious content directly (outside an `iframe`). If there's any chance that certain content may be malicious (e.g., user-generated content), please serve it from a different {{glossary("domain")}} to your main site.

#### Configure CSP directives

{{Glossary("CSP")}} stands for **[content security policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP)** and provides [a set of HTTP Headers](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) (metadata sent along with your web pages when they are served from a web server) designed to improve the security of your HTML document. When it comes to securing `<iframe>`s, you can _[configure your server to send an appropriate `X-Frame-Options` header.](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/X-Frame-Options)_ This can prevent other websites from embedding your content in their web pages (which would enable [clickjacking](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/Clickjacking) and a host of other attacks), which is exactly what the MDN developers have done, as we saw earlier on.

> [!NOTE]
> You can read Frederik Braun's post [On the X-Frame-Options Security Header](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2013/12/12/on-the-x-frame-options-security-header/) for more background information on this topic. Obviously, it's rather out of scope for a full explanation in this article.

## The \<embed> and \<object> elements

The {{htmlelement("embed")}} and {{htmlelement("object")}} elements serve a different function to {{htmlelement("iframe")}} — these elements are general purpose embedding tools for embedding external content, such as PDFs.

However, you are unlikely to use these elements very much. If you need to display PDFs, it's usually better to link to them, rather than embedding them in the page.

Historically these elements have also been used for embedding content handled by browser {{Glossary("Plugin", "plugins")}} such as {{Glossary("Adobe Flash")}}, but this technology is now obsolete and is not supported by modern browsers.

If you find yourself needing to embed plugin content, this is the kind of information you'll need, at a minimum:

<table class="standard-table no-markdown">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col"></th>
      <th scope="col">{{htmlelement("embed")}}</th>
      <th scope="col">{{htmlelement("object")}}</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>{{glossary("URL")}} of the embedded content</td>
      <td><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/embed#src"><code>src</code></a></td>
      <td><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/object#data"><code>data</code></a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <em>Accurate </em>{{glossary("MIME type", "media type")}}
        of the embedded content
      </td>
      <td><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/embed#type"><code>type</code></a></td>
      <td><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/object#type"><code>type</code></a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Height and width (in CSS pixels) of the box controlled by the plugin
      </td>
      <td>
         <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/embed#height"><code>height</code></a><br /><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/embed#width"><code>width</code></a>
      </td>
      <td>
         <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/object#height"><code>height</code></a><br /><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/object#width"><code>width</code></a>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Independent HTML content as a fallback for an unavailable resource</td>
      <td>Not supported (<code>&#x3C;noembed></code> is obsolete)</td>
      <td>
        Contained within the opening and closing
        <code>&#x3C;object></code> tags
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Let's look at an `<object>` example that embeds a PDF into a page (see the [live example](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/multimedia-and-embedding/other-embedding-technologies/object-pdf.html) and the [source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/other-embedding-technologies/object-pdf.html)):

```html
<object data="my-pdf.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="800" height="1200">
  <p>
    You don't have a PDF plugin, but you can
    <a href="my-pdf.pdf">download the PDF file. </a>
  </p>
</object>

PDFs were a necessary stepping stone between paper and digital, but they pose many [accessibility challenges](https://webaim.org/techniques/acrobat/acrobat) and can be hard to read on small screens. They do still tend to be popular in some circles, but it is much better to link to them so they can be downloaded or read on a separate page, rather than embedding them in a webpage.

## Summary

The topic of embedding other content in web documents can quickly become very complex, so in this article, we've tried to introduce it in a simple, familiar way that will immediately seem relevant, while still hinting at some of the more advanced features of the involved technologies. To start with, you are unlikely to use embedding for much beyond including third-party content like maps and videos on your pages. As you become more experienced, however, you are likely to start finding more uses for them.

There are many other technologies that involve embedding external content besides the ones we discussed here. We saw some in earlier articles, such as {{htmlelement("video")}}, {{htmlelement("audio")}}, and {{htmlelement("img")}}, but there are others to discover, such as {{htmlelement("canvas")}} for JavaScript-generated 2D and 3D graphics, and {{SVGElement("svg")}} for embedding vector graphics.
# Headings and paragraphs

{{PreviousMenuNext("Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Webpage_metadata", "Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Emphasis_and_importance", "Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content")}}

One of HTML's main jobs is to give text structure so that a browser can display an HTML document the way its developer intends. This article explains how {{glossary("HTML")}} can be used to provide fundamental page structure by defining headings and paragraphs.

## Headings and paragraphs

Most structured text consists of headings and paragraphs, whether you are reading a story, a newspaper, a college textbook, a magazine, etc.

![An example of a newspaper front cover, showing use of a top level heading, subheadings and paragraphs.](newspaper_small.jpg)

Structured content makes the reading experience easier and more enjoyable.

In HTML, each paragraph has to be wrapped in a {{htmlelement("p")}} element, like so:

```html
<p>I am a paragraph, oh yes I am.</p>
```

Each heading has to be wrapped in a heading element:

```html
<h1>I am the title of the story.</h1>
```

There are six heading elements: {{htmlelement("Heading_Elements", "h1")}}, {{htmlelement("Heading_Elements", "h2")}}, {{htmlelement("Heading_Elements", "h3")}}, {{htmlelement("Heading_Elements", "h4")}}, {{htmlelement("Heading_Elements", "h5")}}, and {{htmlelement("Heading_Elements", "h6")}}. Each element represents a different level of content in the document; `<h1>` represents the main heading, `<h2>` represents subheadings, `<h3>` represents sub-subheadings, and so on.

## Implementing structural hierarchy

For example, in this story, the `<h1>` element represents the title of the story, the `<h2>` elements represent the title of each chapter, and the `<h3>` elements represent subsections of each chapter:

```html
<h1>The Crushing Bore</h1>

<p>By Chris Mills</p>

<h2>Chapter 1: The dark night</h2>

<p>
  It was a dark night. Somewhere, an owl hooted. The rain lashed down on the…
</p>

<h2>Chapter 2: The eternal silence</h2>

<p>Our protagonist could not so much as a whisper out of the shadowy figure…</p>

<h3>The specter speaks</h3>

<p>
  Several more hours had passed, when all of a sudden the specter sat bolt
  upright and exclaimed, "Please have mercy on my soul!"
</p>
```

It's really up to you what the elements involved represent, as long as the hierarchy makes sense. You just need to bear in mind a few best practices as you create such structures:

- Preferably, you should use a single `<h1>` per page—this is the top level heading, and all others sit below this in the hierarchy.
- Make sure you use the headings in the correct order in the hierarchy. Don't use `<h3>` elements to represent subheadings, followed by `<h2>` elements to represent sub-subheadings—that doesn't make sense and will lead to weird results.
- Of the six heading levels available, you should aim to use no more than three per page, unless you feel it is necessary. Documents with many levels (for example, a deep heading hierarchy) become unwieldy and difficult to navigate. On such occasions, it is advisable to spread the content over multiple pages if possible.

## Why do we need structure?

To answer this question, let's take a look at [text-start.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/introduction-to-html/html-text-formatting/text-start.html)—a nice hummus recipe. This document's body currently contains multiple pieces of content. They aren't marked up in any way, but they are separated with line breaks (Enter/Return pressed to go onto the next line).

However, when you open the document in your browser, you'll see that the text appears as a big chunk!

![A webpage that shows a wall of unformatted text, because there are no elements on the page to structure it.](screen_shot_2017-03-29_at_09.20.35.png)

This is because there are no elements to give the content structure, so the browser does not know what is a heading and what is a paragraph. Furthermore:

- Users looking at a web page tend to scan quickly to find relevant content, often just reading the headings, to begin with. (We usually [spend a very short time on a web page](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-long-do-users-stay-on-web-pages/).) If they can't see anything useful within a few seconds, they'll likely get frustrated and go somewhere else.
- Search engines indexing your page consider the contents of headings as important keywords for influencing the page's search rankings. Without headings, your page will perform poorly in terms of {{glossary("SEO")}} (Search Engine Optimization).
- Severely visually impaired people often don't read web pages; they listen to them instead. This is done with software called a [screen reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader). This software provides ways to get fast access to given text content. Among the various techniques used, they provide an outline of the document by reading out the headings, allowing their users to find the information they need quickly. If headings are not available, they will be forced to listen to the whole document read out loud.
- To style content with {{glossary("CSS")}}, or make it do interesting things with {{glossary("JavaScript")}}, you need to have elements wrapping the relevant content, so CSS/JavaScript can effectively target it.

Therefore, we need to give our content structural markup.

## Giving content structure

Let's jump straight in and get you to solve a small code challenge to gain practice with HTML headings and paragraphs:

1. Click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.
2. Wrap the appropriate text at the start of the content inside an `<h1>` element to turn it into a main heading.
3. There are two pairs of words that should be wrapped inside `<h2>` elements to turn them into second level headings.
4. Wrap the remaining sentences in `<p>` elements to turn them into paragraphs. One `<p>` element should sit below each `<h2>` element.

If you make a mistake, you can clear your work using the _Reset_ button in the MDN Playground. If you get really stuck, you can view the solution below the code block.

```html live-sample___headings_paragraphs
Favorite body parts The brain Lovely shape and color. Also does thinkin' stuff.
The feet Knobbly and ugly, but useful for getting about.
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('headings_paragraphs', "100%", 60) }}

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

Your finished HTML element should look like this:

```html
<h1>Favorite body parts</h1>

<h2>The brain</h2>

<p>Lovely shape and color. Also does thinkin' stuff.</p>

<h2>The feet</h2>

<p>Knobbly and ugly, but useful for getting about.</p>
```

</details>

## Why do we need semantics?

Semantics are relied on everywhere around us—we rely on previous experience to tell us what the function of an everyday object is; when we see something, we know what its function will be. So, for example, we expect a red traffic light to mean "stop," and a green traffic light to mean "go." Things can get tricky very quickly if the wrong semantics are applied. (Do any countries use red to mean "go"? We hope not.)

In a similar way, we need to make sure we are using the correct elements, giving our content the correct meaning, function, or appearance. In this context, the `{{htmlelement("Heading_Elements", "&lt;h1>")}}` element is also a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."

```html
<h1>This is a top level heading</h1>
```

By default, the browser will give it a large font size to make it look like a heading (although you could style it to look like anything you wanted using CSS). More importantly, its semantic value will be used in multiple ways, for example by search engines and screen readers (as mentioned above).

On the other hand, you could make any element _look_ like a top level heading. Consider the following:

```html
<span style="font-size: 32px; margin: 21px 0; display: block;">
  Is this a top level heading?
</span>
```

This is a {{htmlelement("span")}} element. It has no semantics. You use it to wrap content when you want to apply CSS to it (or do something to it with JavaScript) without giving it any extra meaning. (You'll find out more about these later on in the course.) We've applied some CSS to it to make it look like a top level heading, but since it has no semantic value, it will not get any of the extra benefits described above. It is a good idea to use the relevant HTML element for the job.

## Summary

This concludes our study of HTML headings and paragraphs. Next, we will look at more aspects of semantic HTML: giving words emphasis.

# Forms and buttons in HTML

HTML forms and buttons are powerful tools for interacting with a website's users. Most commonly, they provide users with controls to manipulate a user interface (UI) or input data when required.

In this article, we provide an introduction to the basics of forms and buttons. There is a lot more to know — a lot of input types and form features are not mentioned — but this article will give you a solid foundation for most cases. You can learn the advanced or specialized uses on a need-to-know basis as part of the constant learning you'll do throughout your career.

## Interacting with users

So far in the course, you have seen a couple of ways in which users can interact with the web:

- [Links](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Creating_links) can be used to navigate to different sections of content, either on the same page or a different page.
- [`<video>` and `<audio>`](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/HTML_video_and_audio) elements generally feature controls such as play/pause, fast forward, rewind, etc., which allow users to consume media content as they wish.

However, these features tend to facilitate one-way interactions, with users passively consuming content. This is fine, but the web is a two-way experience. Website users set preferences for how they want to experience content and services. They order taxis and request call backs. They provide feedback and make complaints. They buy products and get them delivered to their homes.

To provide this two-way experience, you need to use buttons and forms.

Buttons are usually created using HTML {{htmlelement("button")}} elements (they are also sometimes created using {{htmlelement("input")}} elements with their `type` attributes set to a value like `button` or `submit`). These push buttons are general purpose — you can wire them up to trigger any functionality you want, limited only by your imagination and coding skills.

Forms are created using elements such as {{htmlelement("form")}}, {{htmlelement("label")}}, {{htmlelement("input")}}, and {{htmlelement("select")}}. Form elements can be used to create more complex controls than simple buttons allow — for example a drop-down menu containing multiple options that allow you choose between different themes for a user interface element.

However, crucially, they can also be used to create forms for users to fill in when they need to submit information to a website server. Think about e-commerce sites — when you want to search for a product to buy, you use a form to enter search terms. When you want to pay for some items and finalize delivery, you use a form to enter your postal address, and another form to enter your credit card details.

We'll be concentrating mainly on this — more traditional — use of form elements in this article. Note that buttons are also commonly used inside forms, to submit the entered data to the server.

With this important theory out of the way, let's move on to explore the code and see how buttons and forms are implemented.

## Buttons

As hinted at above, buttons have a couple of main uses on the web. First of all, they are used to trigger functionality, which is useful when creating UI controls. The simplest button is implemented using the following code:

```html live-sample___basic-button
<button>Press me</button>
```

This is rendered as follows:

{{EmbedLiveSample("basic-button", "100%", "60")}}

The text appearing in-between the `<button></button>` tags is rendered inside the button, and it is given some basic styling by the browser so it will look and behave like a button by default. So far, so good. However, there is an issue here — our lonesome button won't do anything useful on its own. To make it do something useful, you'll need to put it inside a form (which we'll cover later on), or add some JavaScript.

For example, if you applied the following JavaScript to the above button:

```html hidden live-sample___basic-button-with-js
<button>Press me</button>
```

```js live-sample___basic-button-with-js
const btn = document.querySelector("button");
btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  btn.textContent = "YOU CLICKED ME!! ❤️";
  setTimeout(() => {
    btn.textContent = "Press me";
  }, 1000);
});
```

It would give you the following output — try clicking it:

{{EmbedLiveSample("basic-button-with-js", "100%", "60")}}

You are not expected to understand how the JavaScript works for now. You'll learn more about it later on in the course.

In the next section, you'll see a demonstration of the second main use of buttons — submitting forms.

## The anatomy of a form

A basic form contains three things:

- A {{htmlelement("form")}} element, which wraps all of the other form content. Any form controls inside the `<form></form>` tags are part of the same form, and their data is included when the form is submitted.
- One or more pairs each consisting of a {{htmlelement("label")}} element and a form control element (usually an {{htmlelement("input")}} element, but there are other types as well, for example {{htmlelement("select")}}):
  - The form control element allows the user to choose or enter some data, which will be sent to the server when the form is submitted.
  - The `<label>` element provides an identifying label associated with the form control describing the data that should be entered into it.
- A {{htmlelement("button")}} element, used to submit the form.

Let's look at a basic example that includes the above three items. This form could be used to ask for a user's name and email, to sign them up for a newsletter (don't worry — it isn't connected to any server, so currently won't do anything).

```html live-sample___form-anatomy
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>First form</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form action="./submit_page" method="get">
      <h2>Subscribe to our newsletter</h2>
      <p>
        <label for="name">Name (required):</label>
        <input type="text" name="name" id="name" required />
      </p>
      <p>
        <label for="email">Email (required):</label>
        <input type="email" name="email" id="email" required />
      </p>
      <p>
        <button>Sign me up!</button>
      </p>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

This is rendered as follows:

{{EmbedLiveSample("form-anatomy", "100%", "200", , , , , "allow-forms")}}

If you click "Sign me up!" immediately, you'll see a validation error because no data was entered. If you fill out the fields with a name and email address then click "Sign me up!", you'll see a `404` error message.

We'll explain why later on. Before moving on, copy the previous HTML code listing into a new HTML file using your [code editor](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Environment_setup/Code_editors) and open it in a new browser tab.

### The `<form>` element

As we said earlier, the {{htmlelement("form")}} element acts as the outer wrapper for the form, grouping together all the form controls inside it. When the `<button>` is pressed, all the data represented by the form controls will be submitted to the server. The `<form>` element can take many attributes, but the two most important ones, which we've included in our example, are as follows:

- `action`: Contains a path to the page that we want to send the submitted form data to, to be processed. Later on, after you submit the form, you'll see `/submit_page` included in the URL. You'll also get a {{HTTPStatus("404")}} error response because the page doesn't actually exist, but that's fine for now.
- `method`: Specifies the data transmission [method](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods) you want to use for sending the form data to the server. Don't worry about this too much for now; the `get` value causes the data to be sent as parameters attached to the end of the URL.

#### Checking out the submitted data

1. Go to the example in the separate tab, try entering a name of "Bob" and an email address of "bob@bob.com".
2. Press the `<button>`.

The `action` and `method` attributes cause the form data to be submitted in a URL along the following lines:

```plain
/some/url/submit_page?name=Bob&email=bob%40bob.com
```

#### Structuring forms

You can include any HTML elements you like inside a `<form>` element to structure the form elements themselves and provide containers to target with CSS for styling, etc.

In our example, we've included a [heading element](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/Heading_Elements) (`<h2>`) to describe the purpose of the form.

We've also put each input/label pair and the submit button inside a separate {{htmlelement("p")}}, so that each will appear on a separate line. These elements are all inline by default, meaning that if we didn't do this, they would all sit on the same line.

This is a common pattern for form structuring. Some people use `<p>` elements to separate out their form elements, some use {{htmlelement("div")}}, {{htmlelement("section")}}, or even {{htmlelement("li")}} elements. It doesn't matter a great deal, as long as the elements used make semantic sense. For example, it makes sense to divide form element groups up into separate paragraphs or sections of content, or even items in a list. It would make less sense to represent them as [blockquotes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/blockquote), [asides](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/aside), or [addresses](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/address).

There is a specialized element for grouping form elements together called {{htmlelement("fieldset")}}. This is useful in certain circumstances, such as in complex forms, and when grouping together multiple checkboxes and radio buttons. We'll look at a couple of `<fieldset>` examples later on.

### `<input>` elements

The {{htmlelement("input")}} elements represent the different data items entered into the form. Let's study one of the examples from our basic form:

```html
<input type="text" name="name" id="name" required />
```

The attributes are as follows:

- `type`: Specifies the type of form control to create. There are many different types of form controls, from simple text fields of different types to radio buttons, checkboxes, and more. Type `text` renders a basic text field that can accept any value.
- `name`: Specifies a name for the data item. When the form is submitted, the data is sent in name/value pairs. In each case, the name is equal to this `name` attribute value, and the value is equal to the text entered in the text field.
- `id`: Specifies an ID that can be used to identify the element. In this case, it is used to associate the form control with its `<label>`.
- `required`: Specifies that a value has to be entered into the form element before the form can be submitted. This should only be set on inputs that you require, not on optional fields.

You should be aware that some input types usually don't get their values from text entered into a field. For example, [`<input type="color">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/color) renders a color picker widget that you choose a color from, whereas [`<input type="radio">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/radio) renders a radio button control that can be selected, or not.

In the case of radio buttons, you generally need to provide the value that would be submitted if it is selected inside a specific `value` attribute. Note that you _can_ specify a `value` attribute on input types like `text` and `color` — the effect is that the value is pre-filled into the form field when it is first rendered.

#### `required` and `value` attributes in action

1. Again, go to the example you loaded in a separate tab, and try submitting the form with no value entered in either field. You'll see an error message pop up next to the "Name" field saying something like "Please fill in this field" (it will vary across different browsers). This is the `required` attribute — and the browser's default client-side form validation — in action.
2. Now try submitting the form with a valid name entered in the first field, but a value that is not a valid email address in the second field (something like "aaaa" will do). This time you'll see an error message pop up next to the "Email" field saying something like "Please enter an email address".
3. Try editing the form to include `value="Bob"` on the first input. When you reload the code, you'll see that the first field has a value of "Bob" entered into it by default.

#### Specialized text field inputs

The second exercise above raises an interesting point. The second input field specifically expects an email address, and validates entered values as such. If you look at the form code again, you'll see why — the second `<input>` has a `type` of `email`. There are several specialized text field input types designed to handle specific types of data — [`<input type="number">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/number), [`<input type="password">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/password), [`<input type="tel">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/tel), etc.

Follow some of the links above to find out what these input types are used for. Have a look around our [`<input>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input) reference and see if you can find any more specialized text field input types.

### `<label>` elements

As we said above, {{htmlelement("label")}} elements provide identifying labels associated with form controls that describe the data that should be entered into them. You can put whatever text content you like in `<label>` elements, but they should accurately describe what data the associated form control expects. The association is created by giving the form control an `id` attribute, then giving the `<label>` element a `for` attribute with the same value as the control's `id`.

For example:

```html
<label for="name">Name (required):</label>
<input type="text" name="name" id="name" required />
```

`<label>` elements are important for several reasons, most notably that:

- When visually impaired users use a screen reader to help them read and interact with web page content, the screen reader will read out the associated label text when each control is encountered. This makes it easier for the users to understand what content should be entered into each control.
- They enable you to focus the form elements by clicking on their label text as well as the controls. This is especially useful for mobile phone users, where it can be difficult to accurately select a form element with your finger on a touch screen. Making the **hit area** larger is useful in such circumstances.

#### Explicit and implicit form labels

The form label style you saw above is called an **explicit form label** — the association between control and label is explicitly made via the `id` and `for` attributes. You can also implement an **implicit form label** by nesting the control inside the label, like this:

```html
<label>
  Name (required):
  <input type="text" name="name" required />
</label>
```

The nesting makes an implicit association between control and label, and you no longer need the `id` and `for` attributes.

Either approach is OK, but we'd recommend using the explicit labeling approach. This is because the explicit association is usually easier to identify and understand, especially as your HTML code gets more complex. In addition, screen readers (and other assistive technologies) don't always handle implicit labels correctly.

You can read more about form labeling best practices in [HTML Inputs and Labels: A Love Story](https://css-tricks.com/html-inputs-and-labels-a-love-story/), csstricks.com (2021).

### The `<button>` element

When a {{htmlelement("button")}} element is included inside a `<form>` element, its default behavior is that it will submit the form, provided there is no invalid data present causing submission to be blocked by client-side form validation. You've already seen this behavior when playing with our basic form example above.

There are other button behaviors that can be specified via the `<button>` element's `type` attribute:

- `<button type="submit">` explicitly declares that a button should behave like a submit button. You don't ever really need to declare this, unless for some reason you are including other buttons inside your `<form>`, and you want to make it clear which one the submit button is. This will be very rare.
- `<button type="reset">` creates a _reset button_ — this immediately deletes all data out of the form, resetting it to its initial state. **Don't use reset buttons** — they used to be popular in the early days of the web, but they are usually more annoying than they are helpful. Most people have experienced filling out a long form only to click the reset button by accident instead of the submit button, meaning they have to start again.
- `<button type="button">` creates a button with the same behavior as buttons specified outside of `<form>` elements. As we saw earlier, they do absolutely nothing by default, and JavaScript is needed to give them functionality.

> You can also create the above button types using an `<input>` element with the same `type` values specified — [`<input type="submit">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/submit), [`<input type="reset">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/reset), and [`<input type="button">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/button). However, these have many disadvantages compared to their `<button>` counterparts. You should use `<button>` instead.

## An aside on accessibility

We've already talked about the importance of form labels for accessibility, but we also wanted to include some commentary on the general importance of using the correct semantic elements to create forms (for example, use a `<button>` to submit your form, and not a `<div>` programmed to behave like a `<button>`.) It is perfectly possible to use a combination of CSS and JavaScript to make pretty much any HTML element look and behave like a form element. Developers usually do this for design reasons — some form controls are hard to style.

However, when you do this, you are making life harder for yourself and your users. The browser provides several `<button>` and form control features by default, with no JavaScript or other extra code required, to make forms more usable for all users.

For example:

- Semantic elements are understood by assistive technology such as screen readers, which communicate their meaning to users who cannot see them.
- Form controls and buttons are keyboard-accessible by default. In the previous example, try moving forward and backward between the form elements using <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> (called "tabbing").
- Notice also how tabbing between the form elements causes the focused element to be highlighted using a blue outline (called the **focus outline**). This is an important feature for keyboard users to know where they currently are in the form.

If you don't use the correct semantic elements to implement your forms, you'll have re-implement all of this functionality, otherwise your form elements will not behave as users expect, and therefore seem broken. It all adds up.

## Other control types

There are many other control types you can use to collect data in a form. Let's look at a slightly more complex example, and then we'll explore and explain it.

> [!NOTE]
> In this example, we are assuming the user is already registered and signed in, hence not needing to collect details such as name and email.

```html live-sample___form-other-controls
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Second form</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form action="./payment_page" method="get">
      <h2>Register for the meetup</h2>
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Choose hotel room type:</legend>
        <div>
          <input
            type="radio"
            id="hotelChoice1"
            name="hotel"
            value="economy"
            checked />
          <label for="hotelChoice1">Economy (+$0)</label>

          <input type="radio" id="hotelChoice2" name="hotel" value="superior" />
          <label for="hotelChoice2">Superior (+$50)</label>

          <input
            type="radio"
            id="hotelChoice3"
            name="hotel"
            value="penthouse"
            disabled />
          <label for="hotelChoice3">Penthouse (+$150)</label>
        </div>
      </fieldset>
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Choose classes to attend:</legend>
        <div>

          <label for="yoga">Yoga (+$10)</label>

          <input type="checkbox" id="coffee" name="coffee" />
          <label for="coffee">Coffee roasting (+$20)</label>

          <input type="checkbox" id="balloon" name="balloon" />
          <label for="balloon">Balloon animal art (+$5)</label>
        </div>
      </fieldset>
      <p>
        <label for="transport">How are you getting here:</label>
        <select name="transport" id="transport">
          <option value="">--Please choose an option--</option>
          <option value="plane">Plane</option>
          <option value="bike">Bike</option>
          <option value="walk">Walk</option>
          <option value="bus">Bus</option>
          <option value="train">Train</option>
          <option value="jetPack">Jet pack</option>
        </select>
      </p>
      <p>
        <label for="comments">Any other comments:</label>
        <textarea id="comments" name="comments" rows="5" cols="33"></textarea>
      </p>
      <p>
        <button>Continue to payment</button>
      </p>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

This is rendered as follows:

{{EmbedLiveSample("form-other-controls", "100%", "500", , , , , "allow-forms")}}

We'd recommend that you open this example in a separate browser tab as you work through the next few sections, in which we look at each control type in turn. To achieve this, copy the code into an HTML file using your code editor, and open it in a browser tab.

Before moving on, play with the different form controls in your local copy and select some values. Try submitting the form and see what the data submitted in the URL looks like.

### Radio buttons

The "Choose hotel room type" buttons are implemented using [`<input type="radio">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/radio) controls. These render as a set of push button controls where only one of the set can be selected at any one time — you can't select more than one at once. They are named after the buttons found on old-fashioned radios, where you press one button and the previously-selected one pops out again.

Our example code look looks like this:

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>Choose hotel room type:</legend>
  <div>
    <input
      type="radio"
      id="hotelChoice1"
      name="hotel"
      value="economy"
      checked />
    <label for="hotelChoice1">Economy (+$0)</label>

    <input type="radio" id="hotelChoice2" name="hotel" value="superior" />
    <label for="hotelChoice2">Superior (+$50)</label>

    <input
      type="radio"
      id="hotelChoice3"
      name="hotel"
      value="penthouse"
      disabled />
    <label for="hotelChoice3">Penthouse (+$150)</label>
  </div>
</fieldset>
```

`radio` input types mostly work the same as `text` input types, but with a few differences:

- The `name` attributes for each set of radio buttons have to contain the same value, to associate them together as one set. If they contain different values, they will effectively be separate sets, with different values on submission.
- You have to include a `value` attribute containing the value to submit for each radio button. The submitted value will be a name/value pair, but the name will always be the same, for example `hotel=economy` or `hotel=superior`.
- The `<label>` for each radio button should describe that particular value choice, rather than the overall value you are selecting. The preferred way to provide a description of the overall value choice is to wrap them in a {{htmlelement("fieldset")}}, which takes a {{htmlelement("legend")}} element as a child that contains the description.

> [!NOTE]
> Besides structuring and labeling forms, fieldsets have other uses, such as [disabling](#disabling_form_controls) an entire set of controls as a single unit.

It's also worth noting that we've applied the `checked` attribute to the first radio button — this causes it be selected when the page first loads. This means one option will always be selected, and you can't deselect a radio button without selecting another one.

Try removing the `checked` attribute from the first radio button, save, then reload, to see the effect it has. Put it back before you move on.

#### Disabling form controls

In the radio button example, you'll notice that the third radio button has the `disabled` attribute set on it. This causes the rendered control to be grayed out and unselectable. This is useful in many situations where an option is normally available, just not right now. For example, a product might be out of stock, or as in our example's case, penthouse suites are all booked up!

You can set the `disabled` attribute on any form control, including `<button>` elements. `<fieldset>` elements can also accept the `disabled` attribute — this causes every form control inside the fieldset to be disabled.

Try setting the `disabled` attribute on the two `<fieldset>` elements, save, then reload, to see the effect it has. Remove them again before moving on.

### Checkboxes

Our "classes to attend" selectors are implemented using [`<input type="checkbox">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/checkbox) controls. these render as a set of on/off state checkboxes. Unlike radio buttons, you can select more than one at once.

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>Choose classes to attend:</legend>
  <div>
    <input type="checkbox" id="yoga" name="yoga" />
    <label for="yoga">Yoga (+$10)</label>

    <input type="checkbox" id="coffee" name="coffee" />
    <label for="coffee">Coffee roasting (+$20)</label>

    <input type="checkbox" id="balloon" name="balloon" />
    <label for="balloon">Balloon animal art (+$5)</label>
  </div>
</fieldset>
```

As you can see from the code snippets, radio buttons and checkboxes are implemented in a very similar way (they can also take `checked` attributes to render them pre-selected when the page loads). They also behave in a fairly similar fashion, except that radio buttons allow you to choose zero or one items out of many, and checkboxes allow you to choose zero or more items out of many.

The main difference (apart from the `type` value!) is that each checkbox has a different `name` value, and they generally aren't given `value` attributes. Behavior-wise, this means they represent different data values, whereas a radio button set only represents one. On submission, each value is submitted with a value of `on` if the checkbox was checked — `yoga=on`, `balloon=on`, etc.

> [!NOTE]
> It is possible to change the value submitted for a checkbox by giving it a `value` attribute, for example: `<input type="checkbox" id="yoga" name="yoga" value="yes" />` would result in `yoga=yes` being submitted if checked. However, there is not much point doing this. A checkbox is either submitted with a single value if checked, or it isn't submitted at all. It doesn't really matter what value is sent to the server.

### Drop-down menus

Drop-down menus, for example the "How are you getting here" selection control in our example, are implemented not with an `<input>` type, but with the {{htmlelement("select")}} and {{htmlelement("option")}} elements:

```html
<label for="transport">How are you getting here:</label>
<select name="transport" id="transport">
  <option value="">--Please choose an option--</option>
  <option value="plane">Plane</option>
  <option value="bike">Bike</option>
  <option value="walk">Walk</option>
  <option value="bus">Bus</option>
  <option value="train">Train</option>
  <option value="jetPack">Jet pack</option>
</select>
```

The `<select>` element wraps all the different value choices. It is where you set the `id` attribute that associates the control with its label, and the `name` attribute that sets the name of the data item to be submitted.

Each possible value for the data item is represented by an `<option>` element, nested inside the `<select>` element. Each `<option>` element can take a `value` attribute, which specifies the value to be submitted if that option is chosen from the drop-down list. If you don't specify a `value`, the text inside the `<option></option>` tags is used as the value.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to have a specific option selected on page load, you can add a `selected` attribute to the relevant `<option>` element.

### Multi-line text input fields

Multi-line text input fields are created using {{htmlelement("textarea")}} elements:

```html
<label for="comments">Any other comments:</label>
<textarea id="comments" name="comments" rows="5" cols="33"></textarea>
```

They behave in the same way as `<input type="text">` elements, except that they allow multiple lines of text to be entered. The `rows` attribute specifies the number of rows tall the text area will be by default, while the `cols` attribute specifies the number of columns wide the text area will be by default. If they are not specified, the values used are `cols="20"` and `rows="2"`.

Most browsers render text areas with a drag handle in one corner, which can be used to resize it. Try using this to resize the text area in our demo.

## Form validation

Earlier on, we looked at some of the basic client-side form validation provided by the browser. The `required` attribute is used to specify that a field must be filled out before the form can be submitted; it also checks the correct value type is entered for specific value types like email addresses, URLs, numbers, etc. Validation is important for two main reasons:

- Making sure that data is submitted in the correct format so that it doesn't cause errors in your application.
- Making sure data does not cause security problems. Bad people know how to submit data formatted specifically so that, on insecure applications, it can execute commands to delete databases or take control of a system.

Form validation is a huge topic that is beyond scope for this article, so we will leave it here for now. Just bear in mind that there are two types of form validation:

- Client-side validation, which happens in the browser, implemented using a combination of form validation attributes (like `required`) and JavaScript. Client-side validation is useful for giving users instant hints when they have entered the wrong data, but is not so effective at stopping malicious data from getting through. It is too easy to turn off JavaScript or alter client-side code so that the validation no longer works.
- Server-side validation, which happens on the server, implemented using whatever language the server is using. Badly-formed messages can be sent to a server by accident or on purpose. Conventional wisdom is to make sure that your server doesn't trust anything a client is sending to avoid bugs or security issues caused by malformed messages. Server-side validation is great for stopping malicious messages, as it's harder to tamper with the code running on the server. Server-side validation is not so good at giving users hints about incorrect data because the data has to go to the server to get validated, then the result has to be sent back to the client before the user can be notified.

In short, don't decide between using either client-side or server-side validation - you will need both. You need client-side validation to give users feedback on their input and server-side validation to make sure messages are in a format your server can safely handle. If you want to start learning more about validation, a good place to start is [Client-side form validation](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Form_validation).

## Summary

That's all for now. There's a lot more to know about forms, but for now, we've given you enough of an understanding to move forward in your studies.

Next up, we'll give you some tests that you can use to check how well you've understood and retained the information we've provided on HTML forms.

In the beginning, the web was just text, and it was really quite boring. Fortunately, it wasn't too long before the ability to embed images (and other more interesting types of content) inside web pages was added. In this article we'll look at how to use the {{htmlelement("img")}} element in depth, including the basics, annotating it with captions using {{htmlelement("figure")}}, and detailing how it relates to {{glossary("CSS")}} background images.

## How do we put an image on a webpage?

In order to put an image on a web page, we use the {{htmlelement("img")}} element. This is a {{Glossary("void element")}} (meaning, it cannot have any child content and cannot have an end tag) that requires two attributes to be useful: `src` and `alt`. The `src` attribute contains a URL pointing to the image you want to embed in the page. As with the `href` attribute for {{htmlelement("a")}} elements, the `src` attribute can be a relative URL or an absolute URL. Without a `src` attribute, an `img` element has no image to load.

The [`alt` attribute is described below](#alternative_text).

> [!NOTE]
> You should read [A quick primer on URLs and paths](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Creating_links#a_quick_primer_on_urls_and_paths) to refresh your memory on relative and absolute URLs before continuing.

So for example, if your image is called `dinosaur.jpg`, and it sits in the same directory as your HTML page, you could embed the image like so:

```html
<img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
```

If the image was in an `images` subdirectory, which was inside the same directory as the HTML page, then you'd embed it like this:

```html
<img src="images/dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
```

And so on.

> [!NOTE]
> Search engines also read image filenames and count them towards SEO. Therefore, you should give your image a descriptive filename; `dinosaur.jpg` is better than `img835.png`.

You could also embed the image using its absolute URL, for example:

```html
<img src="https://www.example.com/images/dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />
```

Linking via absolute URLs is not recommended, however. You should host the images you want to use on your site, which in simple setups means keeping the images for your website on the same server as your HTML. In addition, it is more efficient to use relative URLs than absolute URLs in terms of maintenance (when you move your site to a different domain, you won't need to update all your URLs to include the new domain). In more advanced setups, you might use a [CDN (Content Delivery Network)](/en-US/docs/Glossary/CDN) to deliver your images.

If you did not create the images, you should make sure you have the permission to use them under the conditions of the license they are published under (see [Media assets and licensing](#media_assets_and_licensing) below for more information).

> [!WARNING]
> _Never_ point the `src` attribute at an image hosted on someone else's website _without permission_. This is called "hotlinking". It is considered unethical, since someone else would be paying the bandwidth costs for delivering the image when someone visits your page. It also leaves you with no control over the image being removed or replaced with something embarrassing.

The previous code snippet, either with the absolute or the relative URL, will give us the following result:

![A basic image of a dinosaur, embedded in a browser, with "Images in HTML" written above it](basic-image.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Elements like {{htmlelement("img")}} and {{htmlelement("video")}} are sometimes referred to as **replaced elements**. This is because the element's content and size are defined by an external resource (like an image or video file), not by the contents of the element itself. You can read more about them at {{ glossary("replaced elements")}}.

> [!NOTE]
> You can find the finished example from this section [running on GitHub](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/multimedia-and-embedding/images-in-html/index.html) (see the [source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/images-in-html/index.html) too.)

### Alternative text

The next attribute we'll look at is `alt`. Its value is supposed to be a textual description of the image, for use in situations where the image cannot be seen/displayed or takes a long time to render because of a slow internet connection. For example, our above code could be modified like so:

```html
<img
  src="images/dinosaur.jpg"
  alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton;
          it has a large head with long sharp teeth" />
```

The easiest way to test your `alt` text is to purposely misspell your filename. If for example our image name was spelled `dinosooooor.jpg`, the browser wouldn't display the image, and would display the alt text instead:

![The Images in HTML title, but this time the dinosaur image is not displayed, and alt text is in its place.](alt-text.png)

So, why would you ever see or need alt text? It can come in handy for a number of reasons:

- The user is visually impaired, and is using a [screen reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader) to read the web out to them. In fact, having alt text available to describe images is useful to most users.
- As described above, the spelling of the file or path name might be wrong.
- The browser doesn't support the image type. Some people still use text-only browsers, such as [Lynx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_%28web_browser%29), which displays the alt text of images.
- You may want to provide text for search engines to utilize; for example, search engines can match alt text with search queries.
- Users have turned off images to reduce data transfer volume and distractions. This is especially common on mobile phones, and in countries where bandwidth is limited or expensive.

What exactly should you write inside your `alt` attribute? It depends on _why_ the image is there in the first place. In other words, what you lose if your image doesn't show up:

- **Decoration.** You should use [CSS background images](#css_background_images) for decorative images, but if you must use HTML, add a blank `alt=""`. If the image isn't part of the content, a screen reader shouldn't waste time reading it.
- **Content.** If your image provides significant information, provide the same information in a _brief_ `alt` text – or even better, in the main text which everybody can see. Don't write redundant `alt` text. How annoying would it be for a sighted user if all paragraphs were written twice in the main content? If the image is described adequately by the main text body, you can just use `alt=""`.
- **Link.** If you put an image inside {{htmlelement("a")}} tags, to turn an image into a link, you still must provide [accessible link text](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Creating_links#use_clear_link_wording). In such cases you may, either, write it inside the same `<a>` element, or inside the image's `alt` attribute – whichever works best in your case.
- **Text.** You should not put your text into images. If your main heading needs a drop shadow, for example, [use CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-shadow) for that rather than putting the text into an image. However, If you _really can't avoid doing this_, you should supply the text inside the `alt` attribute.

Essentially, the key is to deliver a usable experience, even when the images can't be seen. This ensures all users are not missing any of the content. Try turning off images in your browser and see how things look. You'll soon realize how helpful alt text is if the image cannot be seen.

> [!NOTE]
> See our guide to [Text Alternatives](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/HTML#text_alternatives) and [An alt Decision Tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/) to learn how to use an `alt` attribute for images in various situations.

### Width and height

You can use the [`width`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/img#width) and [`height`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/img#height) attributes to specify the width and height of your image. They are given as integers without a unit, and represent the image's width and height in pixels.

You can find your image's width and height in a number of ways. For example, on the Mac you can use <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> to get the display information for the image file. Returning to our example, we could do this:

```html
<img
  src="images/dinosaur.jpg"
  alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton;
          it has a large head with long sharp teeth"
  width="400"
  height="341" />
```

There's a very good reason to do this. The HTML for your page and the image are separate resources, fetched by the browser as separate HTTP(S) requests. As soon as the browser has received the HTML, it will start to display it to the user. If the images haven't yet been received (and this will often be the case, as image file sizes are often much larger than HTML files), then the browser will render only the HTML, and will update the page with the image as soon as it is received.

For example, suppose we have some text after the image:

```html
<h1>Images in HTML</h1>

<img
  src="dinosaur.jpg"
  alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton; it has a large head with long sharp teeth"
  title="A T-Rex on display in the Manchester University Museum" />
<blockquote>
  <p>
    But down there it would be dark now, and not the lovely lighted aquarium she
    imagined it to be during the daylight hours, eddying with schools of tiny,
    delicate animals floating and dancing slowly to their own serene currents
    and creating the look of a living painting. That was wrong, in any case. The
    ocean was different from an aquarium, which was an artificial environment.
    The ocean was a world. And a world is not art. Dorothy thought about the
    living things that moved in that world: large, ruthless and hungry. Like us
    up here.
  </p>
  <footer>- Rachel Ingalls, <cite>Mrs. Caliban</cite></footer>
</blockquote>
```

As soon as the browser downloads the HTML, the browser will start to display the page.

Once the image is loaded, the browser adds the image to the page. Because the image takes up space, the browser has to move the text down the page, to fit the image above it:

![Comparison of page layout while the browser is loading a page and when it has finished, when no size is specified for the image.](no-size.png)

Moving the text like this is extremely distracting to users, especially if they have already started to read it.

If you specify the actual size of the image in your HTML, using the `width` and `height` attributes, then the browser knows, before it has downloaded the image, how much space it has to allow for it.

This means that when the image has been downloaded, the browser doesn't have to move the surrounding content.

![Comparison of page layout while the browser is loading a page and when it has finished, when the image size is specified.](size.png)

For an excellent article on the history of this feature, see [Setting height and width on images is important again](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/03/setting-height-width-images-important-again/).

> [!NOTE]
> Although, as we have said, it is good practice to specify the _actual_ size of your images using HTML attributes, you should not use them to _resize_ images.

> If you set the image size too big, you'll end up with images that look grainy, fuzzy, or too small, and wasting bandwidth downloading an image that is not fitting the user's needs. The image may also end up looking distorted, if you don't maintain the correct {{glossary("aspect ratio")}}. You should use an image editor to put your image at the correct size before putting it on your webpage.

> If you do need to alter an image's size, you should use [CSS](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics) instead.

### Image titles

As [with links](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Creating_links#adding_supporting_information_with_the_title_attribute), you can also add `title` attributes to images, to provide further supporting information if needed. In our example, we could do this:

```html
<img
  src="images/dinosaur.jpg"
  alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton;
          it has a large head with long sharp teeth"
  width="400"
  height="341"
  title="A T-Rex on display in the Manchester University Museum" />
```

This gives us a tooltip on mouse hover, just like link titles:

![The dinosaur image, with a tooltip title on top of it that reads A T-Rex on display at the Manchester University Museum](image-with-title.png)

However, this is not recommended — `title` has a number of accessibility problems, mainly based around the fact that screen reader support is very unpredictable and most browsers won't show it unless you are hovering with a mouse (so e.g., no access to keyboard users). If you are interested in more information about this, read [The Trials and Tribulations of the Title Attribute](https://www.24a11y.com/2017/the-trials-and-tribulations-of-the-title-attribute/) by Scott O'Hara.

It is better to include such supporting information in the main article text, rather than attached to the image.

### Image embedding practice

It is now your turn to play! This task will get you to embed an image.

1. Click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.
2. Edit the existing {{htmlelement("img")}} tag so that it embeds the image located at the following URL:

   ```url
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/learning-area/master/html/multimedia-and-embedding/images-in-html/dinosaur_small.jpg
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > Earlier we said to never hotlink to images on other servers without permission, but this image is on our GitHub repo, so it is OK.

3. Add an `alt` attribute to the image. You can check that the alt text works by temporarily misspelling the image URL.
4. Set the image's correct `width` and `height` (hint: it is `200px` wide and `171px` high), then experiment with other values to see what the effect is.
5. Set a `title` on the image.

If you make a mistake, you can clear your work using the _Reset_ button in the MDN Playground. If you get really stuck, you can view the solution below the code block.

## Media assets and licensing

Images (and other media asset types) you find on the web are released under various license types. Before you use an image on a site you are building, ensure you own it, have permission to use it, or comply with the owner's licensing conditions.

### Understanding license types

Let's look at some common categories of licenses you are likely to find on the web.

#### All rights reserved

Creators of original work such as songs, books, or software often release their work under closed copyright protection. This means that, by default, they (or their publisher) have exclusive rights to use (for example, display or distribute) their work. If you want to use copyrighted images with an _all rights reserved_ license, you need to do one of the following:

- Obtain explicit, written permission from the copyright holder.
- Pay a license fee to use them. This can be a one-time fee for unlimited use ("royalty-free"), or it might be "rights-managed", in which case you might have to pay specific fees per use by time slot, geographic region, industry or media type, etc.
- Limit your uses to those that would be considered [fair use](https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/what-is-fair-use/) or [fair dealing](https://copyrightservice.co.uk/copyright/p27_work_of_others) in your jurisdiction.

Authors are not required to include a copyright notice or license terms with their work. Copyright exists automatically in an original work of authorship once it is created in a tangible medium. So if you find an image online and there are no copyright notices or license terms, the safest course is to assume it is protected by copyright with all rights reserved.

#### Permissive

If the image is released under a permissive license, such as [MIT](https://mit-license.org/), [BSD](https://opensource.org/license/BSD-3-clause), or a suitable [Creative Commons (CC) license](https://creativecommons.org/chooser/), you do not need to pay a license fee or seek permission to use it. Still, there are various licensing conditions you will have to fulfill, which vary by license.

For example, you might have to:

- Provide a link to the original source of the image and credit its creator.
- Indicate whether any changes were made to it.
- Share any derivative works created using the image under the same license as the original.
- Not share any derivative works at all.
- Not use the image in any commercial work.
- Include a copy of the license along with any release that uses the image.

You should consult the applicable license for the specific terms you will need to follow.

> [!NOTE]
> You may come across the term "copyleft" in the context of permissive licenses. Copyleft licenses (such as the [GNU General Public License (GPL)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) or "Share Alike" Creative Commons licenses) stipulate that derivative works need to be released under the same license as the original.

Copyleft licenses are prominent in the software world. The basic idea is that a new project built with the code of a copyleft-licensed project (this is known as a "fork" of the original software) will also need to be licensed under the same copyleft license. This ensures that the source code of the new project will also be made available for others to study and modify. Note that, in general, licenses that were drafted for software, such as the GPL, are not considered to be good licenses for non-software works as they were not drafted with non-software works in mind.

Explore the links provided earlier in this section to read about the different license types and the kinds of conditions they specify.

#### Public domain/CC0

Work released into the public domain is sometimes referred to as "no rights reserved" — no copyright applies to it, and it can be used without permission and without having to fulfill any licensing conditions. Work can end up in the public domain by various means such as expiration of copyright, or specific waiving of rights.

One of the most effective ways to place work in the public domain is to license it under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/), a specific creative commons license that provides a clear and unambiguous legal tool for this purpose.

When using public domain images, obtain proof that the image is in the public domain and keep the proof for your records. For example, take a screenshot of the original source with the licensing status clearly displayed, and consider adding a page to your website with a list of the images acquired along with their license requirements.

### Searching for permissively-licensed images

You can find permissive-licensed images for your projects using an image search engine or directly from image repositories.

Search for images using a description of the image you are seeking along with relevant licensing terms. For example, when searching for "yellow dinosaur" add "public domain images", "public domain image library", "open licensed images", or similar terms to the search query.

Some search engines have tools to help you find images with permissive licenses. For example, when using Google, go to the "Images" tab to search for images, then click "Tools". There is a "Usage Rights" dropdown in the resulting toolbar where you can choose to search specifically for images under creative commons licenses.

Image repository sites, such as [Flickr](https://flickr.com/), [ShutterStock](https://www.shutterstock.com/), and [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/), have search options to allow you to search just for permissively-licensed images. Some sites exclusively distribute permissively-licensed images and icons, such as [Picryl](https://picryl.com/) and [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/).

Complying with the license the image has been released under is a matter of finding the license details, reading the license or instruction page provided by the source, and then following those instructions. Reputable image repositories make their license conditions clear and easy to find.

## Annotating images with figures and figure captions

Speaking of captions, there are a number of ways that you could add a caption to go with your image. For example, there would be nothing to stop you from doing this:

```html
<div class="figure">
  <img
    src="images/dinosaur.jpg"
    alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton;
            it has a large head with long sharp teeth"
    width="400"
    height="341" />

  <p>A T-Rex on display in the Manchester University Museum.</p>
</div>
```

This is OK. It contains the content you need, and is nicely stylable using CSS. But there is a problem here: there is nothing that semantically links the image to its caption, which can cause problems for screen readers. For example, when you have 50 images and captions, which caption goes with which image?

A better solution, is to use the HTML {{htmlelement("figure")}} and {{htmlelement("figcaption")}} elements. These are created for exactly this purpose: to provide a semantic container for figures, and to clearly link the figure to the caption. Our above example could be rewritten like this:

```html
<figure>
  <img
    src="images/dinosaur.jpg"
    alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton;
            it has a large head with long sharp teeth"
    width="400"
    height="341" />

  <figcaption>
    A T-Rex on display in the Manchester University Museum.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
```

The {{htmlelement("figcaption")}} element tells browsers, and assistive technology that the caption describes the other content of the {{htmlelement("figure")}} element.

> [!NOTE]
> From an accessibility viewpoint, captions and [`alt`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/img#alt) text have distinct roles. Captions benefit even people who can see the image, whereas [`alt`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/img#alt) text provides the same functionality as an absent image. Therefore, captions and `alt` text shouldn't just say the same thing, because they both appear when the image is gone. Try turning images off in your browser and see how it looks.

A figure doesn't have to be an image. It is an independent unit of content that:

- Expresses your meaning in a compact, easy-to-grasp way.
- Could go in several places in the page's linear flow.
- Provides essential information supporting the main text.

A figure could be several images, a code snippet, audio, video, equations, a table, or something else.

### Creating a figure

In this task, we'd like you to take the finished code from the previous task as a starting point, and turn it into a figure:

1. Click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.
2. Wrap the `<img>` element in a {{htmlelement("figure")}} element.
3. Copy the text out of the `title` attribute, put it inside a {{htmlelement("figcaption")}} element below the `<img>` element, then remove the `title` attribute.

If you make a mistake, you can clear your work using the _Reset_ button in the MDN Playground. If you get really stuck, you can view the solution below the code block.

```html live-sample___images-2
<img
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/learning-area/master/html/multimedia-and-embedding/images-in-html/dinosaur_small.jpg"
  alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton; it has a large head with long sharp teeth"
  width="200"
  height="171"
  title="A T-Rex on display in the Manchester University Museum" />
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('images-2', "100%", 200) }}

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

Your finished HTML should look like this:

```html
<figure>
  <img
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/learning-area/master/html/multimedia-and-embedding/images-in-html/dinosaur_small.jpg"
    alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton; it has a large head with long sharp teeth"
    width="200"
    height="171" />
  <figcaption>
    A T-Rex on display in the Manchester University Museum
  </figcaption>
</figure>
```

</details>

## CSS background images

You can also use CSS to embed images into webpages (and JavaScript, but that's another story entirely). The CSS {{cssxref("background-image")}} property, and the other `background-*` properties, are used to control background image placement. For example, to place a background image on every paragraph on a page, you could do this:

```css
p {
  background-image: url("images/dinosaur.jpg");
}
```

The resulting embedded image is arguably easier to position and control than HTML images. So why bother with HTML images? As hinted above, CSS background images are for decoration only. If you just want to add something pretty to your page to enhance the visuals, this is fine. However, such images have no semantic meaning at all. They can't have any text equivalents, are invisible to screen readers, and so on. This is where HTML images shine!

Summing up: if an image has meaning, in terms of your content, you should use an HTML image. If an image is purely decoration, you should use CSS background images (we'll cover these in detail later in the Core modules).

## Summary

That's all for now. We have covered images and captions in detail.

## What is a table?

A table is a structured set of data made up of rows and columns (**tabular data**). A table allows you to quickly and easily look up values that indicate some kind of connection between different types of data, for example a person and their age, or a day of the week, or the timetable for a local swimming pool.

![A sample table showing names and ages of some people - Chris 38, Dennis 45, Sarah 29, Karen 47.](numbers-table.png)

![A swimming timetable showing a sample data table](swimming-timetable.png)

Tables are very commonly used in human society, and have been for a long time, as evidenced by this US Census document from 1800:

![A very old parchment document; the data is not easily readable, but it clearly shows a data table being used.](1800-census.jpg)

It is therefore no wonder that the creators of HTML provided a means by which to structure and present tabular data on the web.

### How does a table work?

The point of a table is that it is rigid. Information is easily interpreted by making visual associations between row and column headers. Look at the table below for example and find a Jovian gas giant with 62 moons. You can find the answer by associating the relevant row and column headers.

When implemented correctly, HTML tables are handled well by accessibility tools such as screen readers, so a successful HTML table should enhance the experience of sighted and visually impaired users alike.

### Table styling

You can also have a [look at the live planets data example](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/tables/assessment-finished/planets-data.html) on GitHub! One thing you'll notice is that the table does look a bit more readable there — this is because the table you see above on this page has minimal styling, whereas the GitHub version has more significant CSS applied.

Be under no illusion; for tables to be effective on the web, you need to provide some styling information with [CSS](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics), as well as good solid structure with HTML. In this lesson we are focusing on the HTML part; you'll find out about styling tables later on, in our [Styling tables](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Tables) lesson.

We won't focus on CSS in this module, but we have provided a minimal CSS stylesheet for you to use that will make your tables more readable than the default you get without any styling. You can find the [stylesheet here](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/tables/basic/minimal-table.css), and you can also find an [HTML template](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/tables/basic/blank-template.html) that applies the stylesheet — these together will give you a good starting point for experimenting with HTML tables.

### When should you avoid HTML tables?

HTML tables should be used for tabular data (information that's easy to work with in rows and columns) — this is what they are designed for. Unfortunately, a lot of people used to use HTML tables to lay out web pages, for example one row to contain a page header, a row to contain each content column, one row to contain the footer, etc. This technique was used in the past because CSS support across browsers used to be a lot more limited. Modern browsers have solid CSS support so table-based layouts are no longer needed. Table layouts are now extremely rare, but you might still see them in some corners of the web.

In short, using tables for layout rather than [CSS layout techniques](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout) is a bad idea. The main reasons are as follows:

1. **Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users**: [screen readers](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/Tooling#screen_readers), used by blind people, interpret the tags that exist in an HTML page and read out the contents to the user. Because tables are not the right tool for layout, and the markup is more complex than with CSS layout techniques, the screen readers' output will be confusing to their users.
2. **Tables produce tag soup**: As mentioned above, table layouts generally involve more complex markup structures than proper layout techniques. This can result in the code being harder to write, maintain, and debug.
3. **Tables are not automatically responsive**: When you use proper layout containers (such as {{htmlelement("header")}}, {{htmlelement("section")}}, {{htmlelement("article")}}, or {{htmlelement("div")}}), their width defaults to 100% of their parent element. Tables on the other hand are sized according to their content by default, so extra measures are needed to get table layout styling to effectively work across a variety of devices.

## Creating your first table

We've talked table theory enough, so, let's dive into a practical example and get you to build up a simple table.

1. First of all, make a copy of [blank-template.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/tables/basic/blank-template.html) and [minimal-table.css](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/tables/basic/minimal-table.css) in a new directory on your local machine. The HTML template already contains a `<link>` element to apply the CSS to the HTML, so you don't need to worry about that.
2. The content of every table is enclosed by these two tags: **[`<table></table>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/table)**. Add these inside the body of your HTML.
3. The smallest container inside a table is a table cell, which is created with a **[`<td>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/td)** element ("td" stands for "table data"). Add the following inside your table tags:

   ```html
   <td>Hi, I'm your first cell.</td>
   ```

4. If we want a row of four cells, we need to copy these tags three times. Update the contents of your table to look like so:

   ```html
   <td>Hi, I'm your first cell.</td>
   <td>I'm your second cell.</td>
   <td>I'm your third cell.</td>
   <td>I'm your fourth cell.</td>
   ```

As you will see, the cells are not placed underneath each other, rather they are automatically aligned with each other on the same row. Each `<td>` element creates a single cell and together they make up the first row. Every cell we add makes the row grow longer.

To stop this row from growing and start placing subsequent cells on a second row, we need to use the **[`<tr>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/tr)** element ('tr' stands for 'table row'). Let's investigate this now.

1. Place the four cells you've already created inside `<tr>` tags, like so:

   ```html
   <tr>
     <td>Hi, I'm your first cell.</td>
     <td>I'm your second cell.</td>
     <td>I'm your third cell.</td>
     <td>I'm your fourth cell.</td>
   </tr>
   ```

2. Now you've made one row, have a go at making one or two more — each row needs to be wrapped in an additional `<tr>` element, with each cell contained in a `<td>`.

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

Your finished HTML should look something like this:

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Hi, I'm your first cell.</td>
    <td>I'm your second cell.</td>
    <td>I'm your third cell.</td>
    <td>I'm your fourth cell.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Second row, first cell.</td>
    <td>Cell 2.</td>
    <td>Cell 3.</td>
    <td>Cell 4.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

</details>

## Adding headers with \<th> elements

Now let's turn our attention to table headers — special cells that go at the start of a row or column and define the type of data that row or column contains (as an example, see the "Person" and "Age" cells in the first example shown in this article). To illustrate why they are useful, have a look at the following table example. First the source code:

```html live-sample___table-headers
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Knocky</td>
    <td>Flor</td>
    <td>Ella</td>
    <td>Juan</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Breed</td>
    <td>Jack Russell</td>
    <td>Poodle</td>
    <td>Streetdog</td>
    <td>Cocker Spaniel</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Age</td>
    <td>16</td>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Owner</td>
    <td>Mother-in-law</td>
    <td>Me</td>
    <td>Me</td>
    <td>Sister-in-law</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eating Habits</td>
    <td>Eats everyone's leftovers</td>
    <td>Nibbles at food</td>
    <td>Hearty eater</td>
    <td>Will eat till he explodes</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

```css hidden live-sample___table-headers
table {
  border-collapse: collapse;
}
td,
th {
  border: 1px solid black;
  padding: 10px 20px;
}
```

Now the actual rendered table:

{{EmbedLiveSample("table-headers", "", "250")}}

The problem here is that, while you can kind of make out what's going on, it is not as easy to cross reference data as it could be. If the column and row headings stood out in some way, it would be much better.

### Adding headers to the dogs table

Now we'd like you to have a go at improving the dogs table example by adding some headers.

1. First, make a local copy of our [dogs-table.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/tables/basic/dogs-table.html) and [minimal-table.css](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/tables/basic/minimal-table.css) files in a new directory on your local machine.
2. To recognize the table headers as headers, both visually and semantically, you can use the **[`<th>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/th)** element ("th" stands for "table header"). This works in exactly the same way as a `<td>`, except that it denotes a header, not a normal cell. Go into your HTML, and change all the `<td>` elements surrounding the table headers into `<th>` elements.
3. Save your HTML and load it in a browser, and you should see that the headers now look like headers.

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

Your finished HTML should look something like this:

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <th>Knocky</th>
    <th>Flor</th>
    <th>Ella</th>
    <th>Juan</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Breed</th>
    <td>Jack Russell</td>
    <td>Poodle</td>
    <td>Streetdog</td>
    <td>Cocker Spaniel</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Age</th>
    <td>16</td>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Owner</th>
    <td>Mother-in-law</td>
    <td>Me</td>
    <td>Me</td>
    <td>Sister-in-law</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Eating Habits</th>
    <td>Eats everyone's leftovers</td>
    <td>Nibbles at food</td>
    <td>Hearty eater</td>
    <td>Will eat till he explodes</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

You can also find this code on GitHub at [dogs-table-fixed.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/tables/basic/dogs-table-fixed.html) ([see it running live also](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/tables/basic/dogs-table-fixed.html)).

</details>

### Why are headers useful?

We have already partially answered this question — it is easier to find the data you are looking for when the headers clearly stand out, and the design just generally looks better.

> [!NOTE]
> Table headings come with some default styling — they are bold and centered even if you don't add your own styling to the table, to help them stand out.

Tables headers also have an added benefit — along with the `scope` attribute (which we'll learn about in the next article), they allow you to make tables more accessible by associating each header with all the data in the same row or column. Screen readers are then able to read out a whole row or column of data at once, which is pretty useful.

## Allowing cells to span multiple rows and columns

Sometimes we want cells to span multiple rows or columns. Take the following simple example, which shows the names of common animals. In some cases, we want to show the names of the males and females next to the animal name. Sometimes we don't, and in such cases we just want the animal name to span the whole table.

The initial markup looks like this:

```html live-sample___multiple-rows-columns
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Animals</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Hippopotamus</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Horse</th>
    <td>Mare</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Stallion</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Crocodile</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Chicken</th>
    <td>Hen</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Rooster</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

```css hidden live-sample___multiple-rows-columns
table {
  border-collapse: collapse;
}
td,
th {
  border: 1px solid black;
  padding: 10px 20px;
}
```

But the output doesn't give us quite what we want:

{{EmbedLiveSample("multiple-rows-columns", "", "350")}}

### Fixing the layout with `rowspan` and `colspan`

We need a way to get "Animals", "Hippopotamus", and "Crocodile" to span across two columns, and "Horse" and "Chicken" to span downwards over two rows. Fortunately, table headers and cells have the `colspan` and `rowspan` attributes, which allow us to do just those things. Both accept a unitless number value, which equals the number of rows or columns you want spanned. For example, `colspan="2"` makes a cell span two columns.

Let's use `colspan` and `rowspan` to improve this table.

1. First, make a local copy of our [animals-table.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/tables/basic/animals-table.html) and [minimal-table.css](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/tables/basic/minimal-table.css) files in a new directory on your local machine. The HTML contains the same animals example as you saw above.
2. Next, use `colspan` to make "Animals", "Hippopotamus", and "Crocodile" span across two columns.
3. Finally, use `rowspan` to make "Horse" and "Chicken" span across two rows.
4. Save and open your code in a browser to see the improvement.

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

Your finished HTML should look something like this:

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2">Animals</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2">Hippopotamus</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="2">Horse</th>
    <td>Mare</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Stallion</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2">Crocodile</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="2">Chicken</th>
    <td>Hen</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Rooster</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

You can also find this code on GitHub at [animals-table-fixed.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/tables/basic/animals-table-fixed.html) ([see it running live also](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/tables/basic/animals-table-fixed.html)).

## Summary

That wraps up the basics of HTML tables. In the next article, we'll look at some further features that can be used to make HTML tables more accessible to visually impaired people.

Now that we are comfortable with adding simple images to a webpage, the next step is to start adding video and audio players to your HTML documents! In this article we'll look at doing just that with the {{htmlelement("video")}} and {{htmlelement("audio")}} elements; we'll then finish off by looking at how to add captions/subtitles to your videos.

## Video and audio on the web

The first influx of online videos and audio were made possible by proprietary plugin-based technologies like [Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash) and [Silverlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Silverlight). Both of these had security and accessibility issues, and are now obsolete, in favor of native HTML solutions {{htmlelement("video")}} and {{htmlelement("audio")}} elements and the availability of {{Glossary("JavaScript")}} {{Glossary("API","APIs")}} for controlling them. We'll not be looking at JavaScript here — just the basic foundations that can be achieved with HTML.

We won't be teaching you how to produce audio and video files — that requires a completely different skill set. We have provided you with [sample audio and video files and example code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/tree/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/video-and-audio-content) for your own experimentation, in case you are unable to get hold of your own.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you begin here, you should also know that there are quite a few OVPs (online video providers) like [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), [Dailymotion](https://www.dailymotion.com/), and [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/), and online audio providers like [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/). Such companies offer a convenient, easy way to host and consume videos, so you don't have to worry about the enormous bandwidth consumption. OVPs even usually offer ready-made code for embedding video/audio in your webpages; if you use that route, you can avoid some of the difficulties we discuss in this article. We'll be discussing this kind of service a bit more in the next article.

## The \<video> element

The {{htmlelement("video")}} element allows you to embed a video very easily. A really simple example looks like this:

```html
<video src="rabbit320.webm" controls>
  <p>
    Your browser doesn't support HTML video. Here is a
    <a href="rabbit320.webm">link to the video</a> instead.
  </p>
</video>
```

The features to note are:

- [`src`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/video#src)
  - : In the same way as for the {{htmlelement("img")}} element, the `src` (source) attribute contains a path to the video you want to embed. It works in exactly the same way.
- [`controls`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/video#controls)
  - : Users must be able to control video and audio playback (it's especially critical for people who have [epilepsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy#Epidemiology).) You must either use the `controls` attribute to include the browser's own control interface, or build your interface using the appropriate [JavaScript API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement). At a minimum, the interface must include a way to start and stop the media, and to adjust the volume.
- The paragraph inside the `<video>` tags
  - : This is called **fallback content** — this will be displayed if the browser accessing the page doesn't support the `<video>` element, allowing us to provide a fallback for older browsers. This can be anything you like; in this case, we've provided a direct link to the video file, so the user can at least access it some way regardless of what browser they are using.

The embedded video will look something like this:

![A simple video player showing a video of a small white rabbit](simple-video.png)

You can [try the example live](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/multimedia-and-embedding/video-and-audio-content/simple-video.html) here (see also the [source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/video-and-audio-content/simple-video.html).)

## Using multiple source formats to improve compatibility

There's a problem with the above example. It is possible that the video might not play for you, because different browsers support different video (and audio) formats. Fortunately, there are things you can do to help prevent this from being an issue.

### Contents of a media file

First, let's go through the terminology quickly. Formats like OGG, WAV, MP4 and WebM are called **[container formats](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Containers)**. They define a structure in which the audio and/or video tracks that make up the media are stored, along with metadata describing the media, what codecs are used to encode its channels, and so forth.

A WebM file containing a movie which has a main video track and one alternate angle track, plus audio for both English and Spanish, in addition to audio for an English commentary track can be conceptualized as shown in the diagram below. Also included are text tracks containing closed captions for the feature film, Spanish subtitles for the film, and English captions for the commentary.

![Diagram conceptualizing the contents of a media file at the track level.](containersandtracks.png)

The audio and video tracks within the container hold data in the appropriate format for the codec used to encode that media. Different formats are used for audio tracks versus video tracks. Each audio track is encoded using an [audio codec](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Audio_codecs), while video tracks are encoded using (as you probably have guessed) [a video codec](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Video_codecs). As we talked about before, different browsers support different video and audio formats, and different container formats (like OGG, MP4, and WebM, which in turn can contain different types of video and audio).

For example:

- A WebM container typically packages Vorbis or Opus audio with VP8/VP9 video. This is supported in all modern browsers, though older versions may not work.
- An MP4 container often packages AAC or MP3 audio with H.264 video. This is also supported in all modern browsers.
- The Ogg container tends to use Vorbis audio and Theora video. This is best supported in Firefox and Chrome, but has basically been superseded by the better quality WebM format.

There are some special cases. For example, for some types of audio, a codec's data is often stored without a container, or with a simplified container. One such instance is the FLAC codec, which is stored most commonly in FLAC files, which are just raw FLAC tracks.

Another example is the ever-popular "MP3 file". An "MP3 file" is an audio file encoded using MPEG-1 Audio Layer III compression. While it can include metadata, it is not encapsulated within a separate MPEG or MPEG-2 container. Its widespread support in the {{htmlelement("audio")}} and {{htmlelement("video")}} elements is largely a testament to its enduring popularity.

An audio player will tend to play an audio track directly, e.g., an MP3 or Ogg file. These don't need containers.

### Media file support in browsers

> [!NOTE]
> Several popular formats, such as MP3 and MP4/H.264, are excellent but are encumbered by patents; that is, there are patents covering some or all of the technology that they're based upon. In the United States, patents covered MP3 until 2017, and H.264 is encumbered by patents through at least 2027.
>
> Because of those patents, browsers that wish to implement support for those codecs must pay typically enormous license fees. In addition, some people prefer to avoid restricted software and prefer to use only open formats. Due to these legal and preferential reasons, web developers find themselves having to support multiple formats to provide a video experience to their entire audience.

The codecs described in the previous section exist to compress video and audio into manageable files, since raw audio and video are both exceedingly large. Each web browser supports an assortment of **{{Glossary("Codec","codecs")}}**, like Vorbis or H.264, which are used to convert the compressed audio and video into binary data and back. Each codec offers its own advantages and drawbacks, and each container may also offer its own positive and negative features affecting your decisions about which to use.

Things become slightly more complicated because not only does each browser support a different set of container file formats, they also each support a different selection of codecs. In order to maximize the likelihood that your website or app will work on a user's browser, you may need to provide each media file you use in multiple formats. If your site and the user's browser don't share a media format in common, your media won't play.

Due to the intricacies of ensuring your app's media is viewable across every combination of browsers, platforms, and devices you wish to reach, choosing the best combination of codecs and container can be a complicated task. See [Choosing the right container](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Containers#choosing_the_right_container) for help selecting the container file format best suited for your needs; similarly, see [Choosing a video codec](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Video_codecs#choosing_a_video_codec) and [Choosing an audio codec](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Audio_codecs#choosing_an_audio_codec) for help selecting the first media codecs to use for your content and your target audience.

One additional thing to keep in mind: mobile browsers may support additional formats not supported by their desktop equivalents, just like they may not support all the same formats the desktop version does. On top of that, both desktop and mobile browsers _may_ be designed to offload handling of media playback (either for all media or only for specific types it can't handle internally). This means media support is partly dependent on what software the user has installed.

So how do we do this? Take a look at the following [updated example](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/video-and-audio-content/multiple-video-formats.html) ([try it live here](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/multimedia-and-embedding/video-and-audio-content/multiple-video-formats.html), also):

```html
<video controls>
  <source src="rabbit320.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="rabbit320.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <p>
    Your browser doesn't support this video. Here is a
    <a href="rabbit320.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.
  </p>
</video>
```

Here we've taken the `src` attribute out of the actual {{HTMLElement("video")}} tag, and instead included separate {{htmlelement("source")}} elements that point to their own sources. In this case the browser will go through the {{HTMLElement("source")}} elements and play the first one that it has the codec to support. Including WebM and MP4 sources should be enough to play your video on most platforms and browsers these days.

Each `<source>` element also has a [`type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/source#type) attribute. This is optional, but it is advised that you include it. The `type` attribute contains the {{glossary("MIME type")}} of the file specified by the `<source>`, and browsers can use the `type` to immediately skip videos they don't understand. If `type` isn't included, browsers will load and try to play each file until they find one that works, which obviously takes time and is an unnecessary use of resources.

Refer to our [guide to media types and formats](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats) for help selecting the best containers and codecs for your needs, as well as to look up the right MIME types to specify for each.

## Other \<video> features

There are a number of other features you can include when displaying an HTML video. Take a look at our next example:

```html
<video
  controls
  width="400"
  height="400"
  autoplay
  loop
  muted
  preload="auto"
  poster="poster.png">
  <source src="rabbit320.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="rabbit320.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <p>
    Your browser doesn't support this video. Here is a
    <a href="rabbit320.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.
  </p>
</video>
```

The resulting UI looks something like this:

![A video player showing a poster image before it plays. The poster image says HTML video example, OMG hell yeah!](poster_screenshot_updated.png)

Features include:

- [`width`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/video#width) and [`height`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/video#height)
  - : You can control the video size either with these attributes or with {{Glossary("CSS")}}. In both cases, videos maintain their native width-height ratio — known as the **aspect ratio**. If the aspect ratio is not maintained by the sizes you set, the video will grow to fill the space horizontally, and the unfilled space will just be given a solid background color by default.
- [`autoplay`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/video#autoplay)
  - : Makes the audio or video start playing right away, while the rest of the page is loading. You are advised not to use autoplaying video (or audio) on your sites, because users can find it really annoying.
- [`loop`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/video#loop)
  - : Makes the video (or audio) start playing again whenever it finishes. This can also be annoying, so only use if really necessary.
- [`muted`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/video#muted)
  - : Causes the media to play with the sound turned off by default.
- [`poster`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/video#poster)
  - : The URL of an image which will be displayed before the video is played. It is intended to be used for a splash screen or advertising screen.
- [`preload`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/video#preload)
  - : Used for buffering large files; it can take one of three values:
    - `"none"` does not buffer the file
    - `"auto"` buffers the media file
    - `"metadata"` buffers only the metadata for the file

You can find the above example available to [play live on GitHub](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/multimedia-and-embedding/video-and-audio-content/extra-video-features.html) (also [see the source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/video-and-audio-content/extra-video-features.html).) Note that we haven't included the `autoplay` attribute in the live version — if the video starts to play as soon as the page loads, you don't get to see the poster!

## The \<audio> element

The {{htmlelement("audio")}} element works just like the {{htmlelement("video")}} element, with a few small differences as outlined below. A typical example might look like so:

```html
<audio controls>
  <source src="viper.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
  <source src="viper.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
  <p>
    Your browser doesn't support this audio file. Here is a
    <a href="viper.mp3">link to the audio</a> instead.
  </p>
</audio>
```

This produces something like the following in a browser:

![A simple audio player with a play button, timer, volume control, and progress bar](audio-player.png)

> [!NOTE]
> You can [run the audio demo live](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/multimedia-and-embedding/video-and-audio-content/multiple-audio-formats.html) on GitHub (also see the [audio player source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/video-and-audio-content/multiple-audio-formats.html).)

This takes up less space than a video player, as there is no visual component — you just need to display controls to play the audio. Other differences from HTML video are as follows:

- The {{htmlelement("audio")}} element doesn't support the `width`/`height` attributes — again, there is no visual component, so there is nothing to assign a width or height to.
- It also doesn't support the `poster` attribute — again, no visual component.

Other than this, `<audio>` supports all the same features as `<video>` — review the above sections for more information about them.

## Displaying video text tracks

Now we'll discuss a slightly more advanced concept that is really useful to know about. Many people can't or don't want to hear the audio/video content they find on the Web, at least at certain times. For example:

- Many people have auditory impairments (such as being hard of hearing or deaf) so can't hear the audio clearly if at all.
- Others may not be able to hear the audio because they are in noisy environments (like a crowded bar when a sports game is being shown).
- Similarly, in environments where having the audio playing would be a distraction or disruption (such as in a library or when a partner is trying to sleep), having captions can be very useful.
- People who don't speak the language of the video might want a text transcript or even translation to help them understand the media content.

Wouldn't it be nice to be able to provide these people with a transcript of the words being spoken in the audio/video? Well, thanks to HTML video, you can. To do so we use the [WebVTT](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API) file format and the {{htmlelement("track")}} element.

> [!NOTE]
> "Transcribe" means "to write down spoken words as text." The resulting text is a "transcript."

WebVTT is a format for writing text files containing multiple strings of text along with metadata such as the time in the video at which each text string should be displayed, and even limited styling/positioning information. These text strings are called **cues**, and there are several kinds of cues which are used for different purposes. The most common cues are:

- subtitles
  - : Translations of foreign material, for people who don't understand the words spoken in the audio.
- captions
  - : Synchronized transcriptions of dialog or descriptions of significant sounds, to let people who can't hear the audio understand what is going on.
- timed descriptions
  - : Text which should be spoken by the media player in order to describe important visuals to blind or otherwise visually impaired users.

A typical WebVTT file will look something like this:

```plain
WEBVTT

1
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.606
This is the first subtitle.

2
00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.074
This is the second.

…
```

To get this displayed along with the HTML media playback, you need to:

1. Save it as a `.vtt` file somewhere the server can serve (see below), such as in the same directory as the HTML file.
2. Link to the `.vtt` file with the {{htmlelement("track")}} element. `<track>` should be placed within `<audio>` or `<video>`, but after all `<source>` elements. Use the [`kind`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/track#kind) attribute to specify whether the cues are `subtitles`, `captions`, or `descriptions`. Further, use [`srclang`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/track#srclang) to tell the browser what language you have written the subtitles in. Finally, add [`label`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/track#label) to help readers identify the language they are searching for.

Here's an example:

```html
<video controls>
  <source src="example.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="example.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <track kind="subtitles" src="subtitles_es.vtt" srclang="es" label="Spanish" />
</video>
```

In order to try this you need to host the files on a [local HTTP server](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/set_up_a_local_testing_server). In the output in browser, you'll see a video that has subtitles displayed. For a full-fledged application and its source code, see [Adding captions and subtitles to HTML video](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Audio_and_video_delivery/Adding_captions_and_subtitles_to_HTML5_video). This example uses JavaScript to allow users to choose between different subtitles. Note that to turn the subtitles on, you need to press the "CC" button and select an option — English, Deutsch, or Español.

> [!NOTE]
> Text tracks also help you with {{glossary("SEO")}}, since search engines especially thrive on text. Text tracks even allow search engines to link directly to a spot partway through the video.

## Embedding your own audio and video

For this task, why not go out into the world and record some of your own video and audio? If you have a phone, use that to record audio and video, transfer it to your computer, and try it out. You may have to do some conversion to end up with a WebM and MP4 in the case of video, and an MP3 and Ogg in the case of audio, but there are enough programs and tools out there to allow you to do this without too much trouble, such as [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/mp4-converter) (online) and [Audacity](https://sourceforge.net/projects/audacity/) (desktop application). We'd like you to have a go!

> [!NOTE]
> If you are unable to source any video or audio, then you can feel free to use our [sample audio and video files](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/tree/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/video-and-audio-content) to carry out this exercise.

We would like you to:

1. Save your audio and video files in a new directory on your computer.
2. Create a new HTML file in the same directory, called `index.html`, based on our [getting started template](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/introduction-to-html/getting-started/index.html).
3. Add {{HTMLElement("audio")}} and {{HTMLElement("video")}} elements to the page; make them display the default browser controls.
4. Give both of them {{HTMLElement("source")}} elements so that browsers will find the audio format they support best and load it. These should include [`type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/source#type) attributes.
5. Give both of them a fallback `<p>` element inside the tags that provides a direct link to the media for non-supporting browsers.
6. Give the `<video>` element a poster that will be displayed before the video starts to be played. Have fun creating your own poster graphic.

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

Your finished HTML should look something like this:

```html
<video controls poster="poster.png">
  <source src="rabbit320.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="rabbit320.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <p>
    Your browser doesn't support HTML video. Here is a
    <a href="rabbit320.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.
  </p>
</video>

<audio controls>
  <source src="viper.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
  <source src="viper.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
  <p>
    Your browser doesn't support HTML audio. Here is a
    <a href="viper.mp3">link to the audio</a> instead.
  </p>
</audio>
```

</details>

## Summary

And that's a wrap — we hope you had fun playing with video and audio in web pages! Next up, we'll give you some tests that you can use to check how well you've understood and retained the information we've provided on HTML video and audio.

# Including vector graphics in HTML

Vector graphics are very useful in many circumstances — they have small file sizes and are highly scalable, so they don't pixelate when zoomed in or blown up to a large size. In this article we'll show you how to include one in your webpage.

> [!NOTE]
> This article doesn't intend to teach you SVG; just what it is, and how to add it to web pages.

## What are vector graphics?

On the web, you'll work with two types of images — **raster images**, and **vector images**:

- **Raster images** are defined using a grid of pixels — a raster image file contains information showing exactly where each pixel is to be placed, and exactly what color it should be. Popular web raster formats include Bitmap (`.bmp`), PNG (`.png`), JPEG (`.jpg`), and GIF (`.gif`).
- **Vector images** are defined using algorithms — a vector image file contains shape and path definitions that the computer can use to work out what the image should look like when rendered on the screen. The {{glossary("SVG")}} format allows us to create powerful vector graphics for use on the Web.

To give you an idea of the difference between the two, let's look at an example. You can find this example live on our GitHub repo as [vector-versus-raster.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/multimedia-and-embedding/adding-vector-graphics-to-the-web/vector-versus-raster.html) — it shows two seemingly identical images side by side, of a red star with a black drop shadow. The difference is that the left one is a PNG, and the right one is an SVG image.

The difference becomes apparent when you zoom in the page — the PNG image becomes pixelated as you zoom in because it contains information on where each pixel should be (and what color). When it is zoomed, each pixel is increased in size to fill multiple pixels on screen, so the image starts to look blocky. The vector image however continues to look nice and crisp, because no matter what size it is, the algorithms are used to work out the shapes in the image, with the values being scaled as it gets bigger.

![Two star images](raster-vector-default-size.png)

![Two star images zoomed in, one crisp and the other blurry](raster-vector-zoomed.png)

> [!NOTE]
> The images above are actually all PNGs — with the left-hand star in each case representing a raster image, and the right-hand star representing a vector image. Again, go to the [vector-versus-raster.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/multimedia-and-embedding/adding-vector-graphics-to-the-web/vector-versus-raster.html) demo for a real example!

Moreover, vector image files are much lighter than their raster equivalents, because they only need to hold a handful of algorithms, rather than information on every pixel in the image individually.

## What is SVG?

[SVG](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) is an {{glossary("XML")}}-based language for describing vector images. It's basically markup, like HTML, except that you've got many different elements for defining the shapes you want to appear in your image, and the effects you want to apply to those shapes. SVG is for marking up graphics, not content. SVG defines elements for creating basic shapes, like {{svgelement("circle")}} and {{svgelement("rect")}}, as well as elements for creating more complex shapes, like {{svgelement("path")}} and {{svgelement("polygon")}}. More advanced SVG features include {{svgelement("feColorMatrix")}} (transform colors using a transformation matrix), {{svgelement("animate")}} (animate parts of your vector graphic), and {{svgelement("mask")}} (apply a mask over the top of your image).

As a basic example, the following code creates a circle and a rectangle:

```html
<svg
  version="1.1"
  baseProfile="full"
  width="300"
  height="200"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="black" />
  <circle cx="150" cy="100" r="90" fill="blue" />
</svg>
```

This creates the following output:

{{ EmbedLiveSample('What_is_SVG', 300, 240, "", "") }}

From the example above, you may get the impression that SVG is easy to hand-code. Yes, you can hand-code simple SVG in a text editor, but for a complex image this quickly starts to get very difficult. For creating SVG images, most people use a vector graphics editor like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) or [Illustrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Illustrator). These packages allow you to create a variety of illustrations using various graphics tools, and create approximations of photos (for example Inkscape's Trace Bitmap feature.)

SVG has some additional advantages besides those described so far:

- Text in vector images remains accessible (which also benefits your {{glossary("SEO")}}).
- SVGs lend themselves well to styling/scripting, because each component of the image is an element that can be styled via CSS or scripted via JavaScript.

So why would anyone want to use raster graphics over SVG? Well, SVG does have some disadvantages:

- SVG can get complicated very quickly, meaning that file sizes can grow; complex SVGs can also take significant processing time in the browser.
- SVG can be harder to create than raster images, depending on what kind of image you are trying to create.

Raster graphics are arguably better for complex precision images such as photos, for the reasons described above.

SVG graphics exported from editors such as Inkscape have great room for size optimization. Before deploying them to the web, you probably want to run them through an SVG optimizer such as [SVGO](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svgo).

## Adding SVG to your pages

In this section we'll go through the different ways in which you can add SVG vector graphics to your web pages.

### The quick way: `img` element

To embed an SVG via an {{htmlelement("img")}} element, you just need to reference it in the src attribute as you'd expect. You will need a `height` or a `width` attribute (or both if your SVG has no inherent {{glossary("aspect ratio")}}). If you have not already done so, please read [HTML images](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/HTML_images).

```html
<img
  src="equilateral.svg"
  alt="triangle with all three sides equal"
  height="87"
  width="100" />
```

#### Pros

- Quick, familiar image syntax with built-in text equivalent available in the `alt` attribute.
- You can make the image into a hyperlink easily by nesting the `<img>` inside an {{htmlelement("a")}} element.
- The SVG file can be cached by the browser, resulting in faster loading times for any page that uses the image loaded in the future.

#### Cons

- You cannot manipulate the image with JavaScript.
- If you want to control the SVG content with CSS, you must include inline CSS styles in your SVG code. (External stylesheets invoked from the SVG file take no effect.)
- You cannot restyle the image with CSS pseudoclasses (like `:focus`).

### Troubleshooting and cross-browser support

For browsers that don't support SVG (IE 8 and below, Android 2.3 and below), you could reference a PNG or JPG from your `src` attribute and use a [`srcset`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/img#srcset) attribute (which only recent browsers recognize) to reference the SVG. This being the case, only supporting browsers will load the SVG — older browsers will load the PNG instead:

```html
<img
  src="equilateral.png"
  alt="triangle with equal sides"
  srcset="equilateral.svg" />
```

You can also use SVGs as CSS background images, as shown below. In the below code, older browsers will stick with the PNG that they understand, while newer browsers will load the SVG:

```css
background: url("fallback.png") no-repeat center;
background-image: url("image.svg");
background-size: contain;
```

Like the `<img>` method described above, inserting SVGs using CSS background images means that the SVG can't be manipulated with JavaScript, and is also subject to the same CSS limitations.

If your SVGs aren't showing up at all, it might be because your server isn't set up properly. If that's the problem, this [article will point you in the right direction](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorials/SVG_from_scratch/Getting_started#a_word_on_web_servers_for_.svgz_files).

### How to include SVG code inside your HTML

You can also open up the SVG file in a text editor, copy the SVG code, and paste it into your HTML document — this is sometimes called putting your **SVG inline**, or **inlining SVG**. Make sure your SVG code snippet begins with an `<svg>` start tag and ends with an `</svg>` end tag. Here's a very simple example of what you might paste into your document:

```html
<svg width="300" height="200">
  <rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="green" />
</svg>
```

#### Pros

- Putting your SVG inline saves an HTTP request, and therefore can reduce your loading time a bit.
- You can assign `class`es and `id`s to SVG elements and style them with CSS, either within the SVG or wherever you put the CSS style rules for your HTML document. In fact, you can use any [SVG presentation attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute#presentation_attributes) as a CSS property.
- Inlining SVG is the only approach that lets you use CSS interactions (like `:focus`) and CSS animations on your SVG image (even in your regular stylesheet.)
- You can make SVG markup into a hyperlink by wrapping it in an {{htmlelement("a")}} element.

#### Cons

- This method is only suitable if you're using the SVG in only one place. Duplication makes for resource-intensive maintenance.
- Extra SVG code increases the size of your HTML file.
- The browser cannot cache inline SVG as it would cache regular image assets, so pages that include the image will not load faster after the first page containing the image is loaded.
- You may include fallback in a {{svgelement("foreignObject")}} element, but browsers that support SVG still download any fallback images. You need to weigh whether the extra overhead is really worthwhile, just to support obsolescent browsers.

### How to embed an SVG with an `iframe`

You can open SVG images in your browser just like webpages. So embedding an SVG document with an `<iframe>` is done just like we studied in [From \<object> to \<iframe> — general embedding technologies](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/General_embedding_technologies).

Here's a quick review:

```html
<iframe src="triangle.svg" width="500" height="500" sandbox>
  <img src="triangle.png" alt="Triangle with three unequal sides" />
</iframe>
```

This is definitely not the best method to choose:

#### Cons

- `iframe`s do have a fallback mechanism, as you can see, but browsers only display the fallback if they lack support for `iframe`s altogether.
- Moreover, unless the SVG and your current webpage have the same {{glossary('origin')}}, you cannot use JavaScript on your main webpage to manipulate the SVG.

## Playing with SVG

In this exercise we'd like you to have a go at playing with some SVG. Press the **Play** button to open the next example in the MDN Playground and edit it there.

Go to the [SVG Element Reference](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element) to see what other elements you can use that bring a lot of built-in functionality.
There are other shapes you can try, like ellipses, or you can experiment with [patterns](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/pattern), or even [filter effects](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/filter).
This section is all about your research skills, trying something new, and having some fun.

If you get stuck and can't get your code working, you can always reset it using the _Reset_ button in the Playground.

```html live-sample___playing-with-svg
<svg width="100%" height="100%">
  <rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="red" />
  <circle cx="100%" cy="100%" r="150" fill="blue" stroke="black" />
  <polygon points="120,0 240,225 0,225" fill="green" />
  <text
    x="50"
    y="100"
    font-family="Verdana"
    font-size="55"
    fill="white"
    stroke="black"
    stroke-width="2">
    Hello!
  </text>
</svg>
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('playing-with-SVG', 700, 300) }}

## Summary

This article has provided you with a quick tour of what vector graphics and SVG are, why they are useful to know about, and how to include SVG inside your webpages. It was never intended to be a full guide to learning SVG, just a pointer so you know what SVG is if you meet it in your travels around the Web. So don't worry if you don't feel like you are an SVG expert yet. We've included some links below that might help you if you wish to go and find out more about how it works.

# Structuring content with HTML

{{NextMenu("Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Basic_HTML_syntax", "Learn_web_development/Core")}}

HTML is the technology that defines the content and structure of any website. Written properly, it should also define the semantics (meaning) of the content in a machine-readable way, which is vital for accessibility, search engine optimization, and making use of the built-in features browsers provide for content to work optimally. This module covers the basics of the language, before looking at key areas such as document structure, links, lists, images, forms, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you don't need any previous HTML knowledge, but you should have at least basic familiarity with using computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it and consuming content). You should have a basic work environment set up (as detailed in [Installing basic software](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Environment_setup/Installing_software)), and understand how to create and manage files (as detailed in [Dealing with files](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Environment_setup/Dealing_with_files)). Both are parts of our [Getting started with the web](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website) complete beginner's module.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are working on a computer, tablet, or another device where you can't create files, you can try running the code in an online editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/).

## Tutorials and challenges

- [Basic HTML syntax](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Basic_HTML_syntax)
  - : Covers the absolute basics of {{glossary("HTML")}}, to get you started — we define elements, attributes, and other important terms, and show where they fit in the language. We also show how a typical HTML page is structured and how an HTML element is structured, and explain other important basic language features. Along the way, we'll play with some HTML to get you interested!
- [What's in the head? Web page metadata](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Webpage_metadata)
  - : The {{Glossary("Head","head")}} of an HTML document is the part that **is not** displayed in the web browser when the page is loaded. It contains metadata information such as the page {{htmlelement("title")}}, links to {{glossary("CSS")}} (if you want to style your HTML content with CSS), links to custom favicons, and metadata (data about the HTML, such as who wrote it, and important keywords that describe the document).
- [Headings and paragraphs](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Headings_and_paragraphs)
  - : One of HTML's main jobs is to give text structure so that a browser can display an HTML document the way its developer intends. This article explains how HTML can be used to provide fundamental page structure by defining headings and paragraphs.
- [Emphasis and importance](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Emphasis_and_importance)
  - : The previous article looked at why semantics are important in HTML, and focused on headings and paragraphs. This article continues on the theme of semantics, looking at HTML elements that apply emphasis and importance to text (parallel to italics and bold text in print media).
- [Lists](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Lists)
  - : Lists are everywhere in life—from your shopping list to the list of directions you subconsciously follow to get to your house every day, to the lists of instructions you are following in these tutorials! It may not surprise you that HTML has a convenient set of elements that allows us to define different types of list. On the web, we have three types of lists: unordered, ordered, and description lists. This lesson shows you how to use the different types.
- [Advanced text features](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Advanced_text_features)
  - : There are many other elements in HTML for defining text semantics, which we didn't get to in the [Emphasis and importance](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Emphasis_and_importance) article. The elements described in this article are less known, but still useful to know about (and this is still not a complete list by any means). Here you'll learn about marking up quotations, computer code and other related text, subscript and superscript, contact information, and more.

- [Marking up a letter](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Marking_up_a_letter) <sup>Challenge</sup>

- [Structuring documents](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Structuring_documents)
  - : In addition to defining individual parts of your page (such as "a paragraph" or "an image"), HTML also boasts a number of block level elements used to define areas of your website (such as "the header", "the navigation menu", "the main content column"). This article looks into how to plan a basic website structure, and write the HTML to represent this structure.

- [Creating links](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Creating_links)
  - : Links (also known as hyperlinks) are really important — they are what makes the Web _a web_. This article shows the syntax required to make a link, and discusses link best practices.

- [Structuring a page of content](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Structuring_a_page_of_content) <sup>Challenge</sup>
  - : Structuring a page of content ready for laying it out using CSS is a very important skill to master, so in this challenge you'll be tested on your ability to think about how a page might end up looking, and choose appropriate structural semantics to build a layout on top of.
- [HTML images](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/HTML_images)
  - : In the beginning, the web was just text, and it was really quite boring. Fortunately, it wasn't too long before the ability to embed images (and other more interesting types of content) inside web pages was added. In this article we'll look at how to use the {{htmlelement("img")}} element in depth, including the basics, annotating it with captions using {{htmlelement("figure")}}, and detailing how it relates to {{glossary("CSS")}} background images.
- [HTML video and audio](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/HTML_video_and_audio)
  - : Now that we are comfortable with adding simple images to a webpage, the next step is to start adding video and audio players to your HTML documents! In this article we'll look at doing just that with the {{htmlelement("video")}} and {{htmlelement("audio")}} elements; we'll then finish off by looking at how to add captions/subtitles to your videos.
- [Creepy-crawly splash page](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Splash_page) <sup>Challenge</sup>
  - : In this challenge, we'll test your knowledge of some of the techniques discussed in the last couple of lessons, getting you to add some images and video to a splash page all about bugs and other creepy crawlies.
- [HTML table basics](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/HTML_table_basics)

# Lists

{{PreviousMenuNext("Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Emphasis_and_importance", "Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Test_your_skills/HTML_text_basics", "Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content")}}

Now let's turn our attention to lists. Lists are everywhere in life—from your shopping list to the list of directions you subconsciously follow to get to your house every day, to the lists of instructions you are following in these tutorials! It may not surprise you that HTML has a convenient set of elements that allows us to define different types of list. On the web, we have three types of lists: unordered, ordered, and description lists. This lesson shows you how to use the different types.

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Prerequisites:</th>
      <td>
        Basic HTML familiarity, as covered in
        <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Basic_HTML_syntax"
          >Basic HTML Syntax</a
        >.
      </td>
    </tr>

      <th scope="row">Learning outcomes:</th>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>The HTML structure for the three types of lists — unordered, ordered, and description.</li>

          <li>The broader use cases of lists, such as navigation menus.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Unordered lists

Unordered lists are used to mark up lists of items for which the order of the items doesn't matter. Let's take a grocery shopping list as an example:

```plain
milk
eggs
bread
hummus
```

In this example, the items can be in any order. To create this list in HTML, we first wrap the whole list in a {{htmlelement("ul")}} (unordered list) element.
Then, we wrap each item in a {{htmlelement("li")}} (list item) element:

```html
<ul>
  <li>milk</li>
  <li>eggs</li>
  <li>bread</li>
  <li>hummus</li>
</ul>
```

### Marking up an unordered list

To give you some practice, we want you to have a go at marking up the previous list yourself:

1. Click **"Play"** in the rendered code output below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.
2. Turn the individual text items into an unordered list.

If you make a mistake, you can clear your work using the _Reset_ button in the MDN Playground. If you get stuck, refer back to the previous code snippet.

```html hidden live-sample___lists_1
milk eggs bread hummus
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('lists_1', "100%", 60) }}

## Ordered

Ordered lists are lists in which the order of the items _does_ matter. Let's take a set of directions as an example:

```plain
Drive to the end of the road
Turn right
Go straight across the first two roundabouts
Turn left at the third roundabout
The school is on your right, 300 meters up the road
```

The markup structure is the same as for unordered lists, except that you have to wrap the list items in an {{htmlelement("ol")}} element, rather than `<ul>`:

```html
<ol>
  <li>Drive to the end of the road</li>
  <li>Turn right</li>
  <li>Go straight across the first two roundabouts</li>
  <li>Turn left at the third roundabout</li>
  <li>The school is on your right, 300 meters up the road</li>
</ol>
```

### Marking up an ordered list

Practice time again! In the same way as the previous task, we want you to have a go at marking up the previous ordered list yourself.

1. Click **"Play"** in the rendered code output below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.
2. Turn the individual text items into an ordered list.

If you make a mistake, you can clear your work using the _Reset_ button in the MDN Playground. If you get stuck, refer back to the previous code snippet.

```html hidden live-sample___lists_2
Drive to the end of the road Turn right Go straight across the first two
roundabouts Turn left at the third roundabout The school is on your right, 300
meters up the road
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('lists_2', "100%", 60) }}

## Marking up our recipe page

Now for a real challenge! At this point in the article, you have all the information you need to mark up a slightly more complex section of content. We want you to mark up the instructions for our favorite hummus recipe.

You can choose to either:

- Save a local copy of our [text-start.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/introduction-to-html/html-text-formatting/text-start.html) starting file and do the work in your code editor.
- Click **"Play"** in the rendered code output below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.

The instructions you need to follow are:

1. Mark up the main page title using an `<h1>` element, and the three subtitles using `<h2>` elements.
2. There are five lines of text that make sense to be marked up with `<p>` elements. Do this now.
3. Mark up the list of ingredients as an unordered list.
4. Mark up the list of instructions as an ordered list.

If you make a mistake, you can clear your work using the _Reset_ button in the MDN Playground. If you get really stuck, you can view the solution below the code output.

```html-nolint live-sample___lists_3
Quick hummus recipe

This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.

Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.

Ingredients

1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)
175g of tahini
6 sundried tomatoes
Half a red pepper
A pinch of cayenne pepper
1 clove of garlic
A dash of olive oil

Instructions

Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely
Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely
Add all the ingredients into a food processor
Process all the ingredients into a paste
If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time
If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time

For a different flavor, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.

Storage

Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.

Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
```

You can find an example of the correct HTML for this example at [text-complete.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/introduction-to-html/html-text-formatting/text-complete.html) in our GitHub repo.

</details>

## Nesting lists

It is perfectly OK to nest one list inside another one. You might want to have some sub-bullets sitting below a top-level bullet. Let's take the second list from our recipe example:

```html
<ol>
  <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely.</li>
  <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely.</li>
  <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor.</li>
  <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
  <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time.</li>
  <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time.</li>
</ol>
```

Since the last two bullets are very closely related to the one before them (they read like sub-instructions or choices that fit below that bullet), it might make sense to nest them inside their own unordered list and put that list inside the current fourth bullet. This would look like so:

```html
<ol>
  <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely.</li>
  <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely.</li>
  <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor.</li>
  <li>
    Process all the ingredients into a paste.
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time.
      </li>
      <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
```

Try going back to the previous task and updating the second list like this.

## Description lists

The purpose of description lists is to mark up a set of items and their associated descriptions, such as terms and definitions, or questions and answers. Let's look at an example of a set of terms and definitions:

```plain
soliloquy
In drama, where a character speaks to themselves, representing their inner thoughts or feelings and in the process relaying them to the audience (but not to other characters.)
monologue
In drama, where a character speaks their thoughts out loud to share them with the audience and any other characters present.
aside
In drama, where a character shares a comment only with the audience for humorous or dramatic effect. This is usually a feeling, thought or piece of additional background information
```

Description lists use a different wrapper than the other list types — {{htmlelement("dl")}}; in addition each term is wrapped in a {{htmlelement("dt")}} (description term) element, and each description is wrapped in a {{htmlelement("dd")}} (description definition) element.

### Description list example

Let's finish marking up our example:

```html
<dl>
  <dt>soliloquy</dt>
  <dd>
    In drama, where a character speaks to themselves, representing their inner
    thoughts or feelings and in the process relaying them to the audience (but
    not to other characters.)
  </dd>
  <dt>monologue</dt>
  <dd>
    In drama, where a character speaks their thoughts out loud to share them
    with the audience and any other characters present.
  </dd>
  <dt>aside</dt>
  <dd>
    In drama, where a character shares a comment only with the audience for
    humorous or dramatic effect. This is usually a feeling, thought, or piece of
    additional background information.
  </dd>
</dl>
```

The browser default styles will display description lists with the descriptions indented somewhat from the terms.

{{EmbedLiveSample('Description_list_example', '100%', '285px')}}

### Multiple descriptions for one term

Note that it is permitted to have a single term with multiple descriptions, for example:

```html
<dl>
  <dt>aside</dt>
  <dd>
    In drama, where a character shares a comment only with the audience for
    humorous or dramatic effect. This is usually a feeling, thought, or piece of
    additional background information.
  </dd>
  <dd>
    In writing, a section of content that is related to the current topic, but
    doesn't fit directly into the main flow of content so is presented nearby
    (often in a box off to the side.)
  </dd>
</dl>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Multiple_descriptions_for_one_term', '100%', '193px')}}

### Marking up a set of definitions

It's time to try your hand at marking up a description list:

1. Click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.
2. Use suitable elements to mark up the three terms and four descriptions in the content. Bear in mind that the third term has two descriptions.

If you make a mistake, you can clear your work using the _Reset_ button in the MDN Playground. If you get really stuck, you can view the solution below the code block.

```html-nolint live-sample___lists_4
Love
The glue that binds the world together.
Eggs
The glue that binds the cake together.
Coffee
The drink that gets the world running in the morning.
A light brown color.
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('lists_4', "100%", 60) }}

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

Your finished HTML should look like this:

```html
<dl>
  <dt>Love</dt>
  <dd>The glue that binds the world together.</dd>
  <dt>Eggs</dt>
  <dd>The glue that binds the cake together.</dd>
  <dt>Coffee</dt>
  <dd>The drink that gets the world running in the morning.</dd>
  <dd>A light brown color.</dd>
</dl>
```

</details>

Re: Eileen Dover university application

Dear Eileen,

Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of
Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your
PhD (Doctor of Philosophy) next year. I will answer your
questions one by one, in the following sections.

Starting dates

We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time,
however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a
semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:

First semester: 9 September 2016
Second semester: 15 January 2017
Third semester: 2 May 2017

Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would
prefer.

Subjects of study

At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research
facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science
and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and
just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the
ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of
priority:

Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol
(C14H12O3.)
Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures
exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases
(effect of 3 × 103 increasing to 3 × 104.)
HTML, Hypertext Markup Language, and CSS,
Cascading Style Sheets, constructs for representing musical scores.

So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects,
including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and
other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.

Exotic dance moves

Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I
did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my
favorite dances are as follows, with definitions:

Polynesian chicken dance
    A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as
    300 BCE, a whole village would
    dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to
    be "fruitful".
Icelandic brownian shuffle
    Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they
    used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a
    circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly
    tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that
    he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
Arctic robot dance
    An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in
    the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by
    "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern
    Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were
    just moving like this because they were really cold.

Yours sincerely,

Dr Eleanor Gaye

## Project brief

For this project, your task is to mark up a letter that needs to be hosted on a university intranet. The letter is a response from a research fellow to a prospective PhD student concerning their application to the university.

### Block/structural semantics

- Add an appropriate HTML structure including doctype, and {{htmlelement("html")}}, {{htmlelement("head")}} and {{htmlelement("body")}} elements.
- In general, the letter should be marked up as an organization of headings and paragraphs, except for the addresses mentioned in the next bullet. There is one top level heading (the "Re:" line) and three second level headings.
- Put the two addresses inside {{htmlelement("address")}} elements. Each line of the address should sit on a new line, but not be in a new paragraph.
- Use an appropriate list type to mark up the semester start dates, study subjects, and exotic dances.

### Inline semantics

- The names of the sender and receiver (and _Tel_ and _Email_) should be marked up with strong importance.
- The four dates in the document should be wrapped in appropriate elements containing machine-readable dates.
- The first address and first date in the letter should have a `class` attribute value of `sender-column` set on them. The CSS you'll add later will cause these to be right aligned, as it should be in the case in a classic letter layout.
- Mark up the following five acronyms/abbreviations in the main text of the letter — "PhD," "HTML," "CSS," "BC," and "Esq." — to provide expansions of each one.
- The six sub/superscripts should be marked up appropriately — in the chemical formulae, and the numbers 103 and 104 (they should be 10 to the power of 3 and 4, respectively).
- Mark up at least two other appropriate words in the text with strong importance/emphasis.
- Mark up the university motto quote and citation with appropriate elements.

### The head of the document

- The character set of the document should be set as `utf-8` using the appropriate `<meta>` tag.
- The author of the letter should be specified in an appropriate `<meta>` tag.
- You should set the language of the document as `en-US`.
- Include the following text inside a document title element: "Awesome science application correspondence".
- The following CSS should be included inside an appropriate element inside the head:

  ```css
  body {
    font: 1.2em / 1.5 system-ui;
  }

  .sender-column {
    text-align: right;
  }

  h1 {
    font-size: 1.5em;
  }

  h2 {
    font-size: 1.3em;
  }
  ```

## Hints and tips

- Use the [W3C HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate your HTML. Award yourself bonus points if it validates.
- You don't need to know any CSS to do this assignment. You just need to put the provided CSS inside an HTML element.

## Example

The following live example shows what the letter should look like after being marked up. If you are getting stuck on how to achieve some of this, see the solution below the live example.

# Challenge: Structuring a planet data table

{{PreviousMenuNext("Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Table_accessibility", "Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/HTML_forms", "Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content")}}

In this challenge, we provide you with some data on the planets in our solar system. Your job is to structure it into an accessible HTML table.

## Starting point

To start the assessment, make local copies of [blank-template.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/tables/assessment-start/blank-template.html), [minimal-table.css](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/tables/assessment-start/minimal-table.css), and [planets-data.txt](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/tables/assessment-start/planets-data.txt) in a new directory in your local computer.

> [!NOTE]
> You can try solutions in your code editor or in an online editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/).
>
> If you get stuck, you can reach out to us in one of our [communication channels](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels).

## Project brief

You are working at a school; currently your students are studying the planets of our solar system, and you want to provide them with an easy-to-follow set of data to look up facts and figures about the planets. An HTML data table would be ideal — you need to take the raw data you have available and turn it into a table, following the steps below.

### Steps to complete

The following steps describe what you need to do to complete the table example. All the data you'll need is contained in the `planets-data.txt` file. If you have trouble visualizing the data, look at the live example below, or try drawing a diagram.

1. Open your copy of `blank-template.html`, and start the table off by giving it an outer container, a table header, and a table body. You don't need a table footer for this example.
2. Add the provided caption to your table.
3. Add a row to the table header containing all the column headers.
4. Create all the content rows inside the table body, remembering to make all the row headings into headings semantically.
5. Ensure all the content is placed into the right cells — in the raw data, each row of planet data is shown next to its associated planet.
6. Add attributes to make the row and column headers unambiguously associated with the rows, columns, or row groups that they act as headings for.
7. Add a black [border](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border) just around the column that contains all the planet name row headers.

## Hints and tips

- The first cell of the header row needs to be blank, and span two columns.
- The group row headings (e.g., _Jovian planets_) that sit to the left of the planet name row headings (e.g., _Saturn_) are a little tricky to sort out — you need to make sure each one spans the correct number of rows and columns.
- One way of associating headers with their rows/columns is a lot easier than the other way.

## Example

The finished table should look like this:

![Complex table has a caption above it. The top row cells are column headers. There are three columns of headers. The first two columns have merged cells, with the third column being individual headers for each row. All the text is centered. The headers and every other row have a slight background color.](assessment-table.png)

# Challenge: Creepy-crawly splash page

{{PreviousMenuNext("Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Test_your_skills/Audio_and_video", "Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/HTML_table_basics", "Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content")}}

In this challenge, we'll test your knowledge of some of the techniques discussed in the last couple of lessons, getting you to add some images and a video to a splash page all about bugs and other creepy crawlies.

## Starting point

To solve this challenge we are expecting you to create a simple website project, either inside a folder on your computer's hard drive, or using an online editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/). Much of the code you need is already provided.

1. Create a new folder in an appropriate location on your computer called `splash-page-challenge` (or open an online editor and take the required steps to create a new project).
2. Save the following HTML listing inside a file inside your folder called `index.html` (or paste it into your online editor's HTML pane).

   ```html

           <h1>Creepy-crawlies splash page!</h1>

           <p>
             In casual language, people use “bugs” to mean all sorts of small
             creepy-crawlies: insects, spiders, etc. However, “Bugs” (true bugs)
             are actually just one order of insects (Hemiptera). This page
             provides a summary of the main classes or groups of
             creepy-crawlies.

           <h2>Beetles (Coleoptera)</h2>

           <p>
             Beetles make up the largest order of insects, with more than
             350,000 known species. They are recognized by their hardened
             forewings (elytra) that cover and protect the delicate hindwings
             and abdomen. This feature gives them a tough, armored look and
             helps them survive in many environments, from forests to deserts.
             Beetles can vary greatly in size, color, and habits, ranging from
             tiny grain beetles to massive stag beetles with impressive jaws.
           </p>
           <p>
             Many beetles play important ecological roles. Some, like ladybugs,
             are beneficial predators that feed on crop pests such as aphids.
             Others, such as dung beetles, recycle nutrients by breaking down
             animal waste. However, certain species like the Colorado potato
             beetle or Japanese beetle are major agricultural pests. Their
             diversity and adaptability make beetles one of the most successful
             groups of insects on Earth.
           </p>

           <h2>True Bugs (Hemiptera)</h2>

           <p>
             True bugs include a wide range of insects such as stink bugs,
             cicadas, aphids, and water striders. Unlike beetles, their
             forewings are partly hardened and partly membranous, and they
             possess distinctive piercing-sucking mouthparts. These mouthparts
             are adapted for feeding on plant sap, blood, or other insects. Many
             true bugs have scent glands that produce strong odors as a defense
             mechanism, which is why some are called “stink bugs.”
           </p>

           <p>
             True bugs are found worldwide and occupy a variety of habitats,
             including plants, soil, and water. While some species are harmless
             or even beneficial predators, others are destructive agricultural
             pests that weaken plants by draining their sap. Certain bugs, like
             bed bugs and kissing bugs, can also affect humans directly by
             biting or transmitting diseases.

           <h2>Butterflies & Moths (Lepidoptera)</h2>

           <p>
             Butterflies and moths are some of the most recognizable insects
             thanks to their large, often colorful wings covered in tiny scales.
             These scales give their wings shimmering, patterned appearances and
             are one of the defining traits of this group. Butterflies are
             usually active by day, while moths are mostly nocturnal, though
             there are exceptions. Both undergo complete metamorphosis, with a
             dramatic transformation from caterpillar to winged adult.
           </p>

           <p>
             As caterpillars, they primarily feed on leaves, sometimes causing
             damage to crops and plants. As adults, butterflies and many moths
             are important pollinators, transferring pollen as they sip nectar
             from flowers. They are also ecologically vital as food sources for
             birds, bats, and other animals. Their beauty and ecological
             importance make them a favorite group for nature enthusiasts and
             scientists alike.

           <h2>Flies & Mosquitoes (Diptera)</h2>

           <p>
             Flies and mosquitoes belong to the order Diptera, meaning “two
             wings.” Unlike most other insects, they have only one functional
             pair of wings; the hind pair has evolved into tiny balancing organs
             called halteres. This adaptation gives them incredible agility in
             flight. Their mouthparts vary widely: some species have sponging
             mouthparts (like houseflies), while others have piercing-sucking
             ones (like mosquitoes).
           </p>

           <p>
             These insects are among the most ecologically and medically
             significant. Many flies are decomposers, helping break down waste
             and recycle nutrients. Mosquitoes, however, are infamous as disease
             vectors, spreading malaria, dengue, and other illnesses. Despite
             their negative reputation, flies and mosquitoes are essential in
             ecosystems, serving as pollinators and as a major food source for
             many animals.

           <h2>Bees, Wasps, Ants (Hymenoptera)</h2>

           <p>
             Bees, wasps, and ants are a diverse group known for their complex
             behaviors and social structures. Many species live in colonies with
             distinct roles for workers, queens, and males. Bees are especially
             famous for pollination, producing honey, and communicating with
             each other through dances. Wasps are often predators or
             parasitoids, while ants are skilled builders and cooperative
             foragers.
           </p>

           <p>
             This group has a huge ecological impact. Bees and wasps contribute
             to pollination, supporting food crops and wild plants. Some wasps
             help control pest populations by preying on or parasitizing other
             insects. Ants are critical soil engineers, aerating the ground and
             recycling nutrients. While stings and aggressive behaviors make
             some species feared, they are vital players in natural and
             agricultural systems.

           <h2>Spiders (Araneae)</h2>

           <p>
             Spiders are arachnids, not insects, and are easily distinguished by
             their eight legs and lack of antennae. Almost all spiders are
             predators, using venom and silk to capture prey. Many build
             intricate webs to trap insects, while others are active hunters
             that chase or ambush their food. Their silk is an incredibly strong
             and versatile material, used for webs, egg sacs, or safety lines.
           </p>

           <p>
             Spiders are found in nearly every habitat on Earth, from deserts to
             caves to homes. While some people fear them, very few species pose
             a danger to humans. In fact, spiders are highly beneficial because
             they help control insect populations, including pests. They play a
             crucial role in balancing ecosystems, making them one of the most
             important non-insect “bugs” people commonly encounter.

## Project brief

In this assessment we are presenting you with a mostly-finished splash page about different creepy-crawlies. Unfortunately, no images or video have been added yet — this is your job! You need to add some media to make the page look more interesting. The following subsections detail what you need to do.

### Adding a video to the header

Just below the `<h1>`, add a `<video>` element that embeds our header video into the page. We'd like it to do the following:

- Specify the [media type](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/MIME_types) of the video.
- Autoplay the video on load (for this to work in at least some browsers, you'll also need to specify that the video should be muted).
- Loop endlessly rather than playing once.
- Preload the video content.
- Not show any controls.

### Adding section images

In the expanded information sections on each type of bug, below each `<h2>`, we'd like you to add an image element that embeds the appropriate image for each section. Give each image some appropriate alternative text for the benefit of screen reader users (and in case the image doesn't load), and constrain each image to dimensions of 250 x 180.

In addition, we'd like you to include a caption for each image; think about what container element is needed to semantically associate the two together. Don't just make the caption repeat the alternative text; it should work alongside the alternative text and the image.

### Add bug emojis or icons to the nav menu and `<h2>`s

For a bit of fun, we'd like you to add icons to the start of each nav list item, and the same icon to the start of each corresponding `<h2>`. You could do this using embedded images, but it's easier to just find appropriate emojis and add them to the HTML text itself.

## Hints and tips

- You can use the [W3C HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to catch mistakes in your HTML.
- You don't need to know any CSS to do this assessment; you just need to edit the provided HTML file. The CSS part is already done for you.

          In casual language, people use “bugs” to mean all sorts of small
          creepy-crawlies: insects, spiders, etc. However, “Bugs” (true bugs)
          are actually just one order of insects (Hemiptera). This page provides
          a summary of the main classes or groups of creepy-crawlies.

        <p>
          Beetles make up the largest order of insects, with more than 350,000
          known species. They are recognized by their hardened forewings
          (elytra) that cover and protect the delicate hindwings and abdomen.
          This feature gives them a tough, armored look and helps them survive
          in many environments, from forests to deserts. Beetles can vary
          greatly in size, color, and habits, ranging from tiny grain beetles to
          massive stag beetles with impressive jaws.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many beetles play important ecological roles. Some, like ladybugs, are
          beneficial predators that feed on crop pests such as aphids. Others,
          such as dung beetles, recycle nutrients by breaking down animal waste.
          However, certain species like the Colorado potato beetle or Japanese
          beetle are major agricultural pests. Their diversity and adaptability
          make beetles one of the most successful groups of insects on Earth.

        <p>
          True bugs include a wide range of insects such as stink bugs, cicadas,
          aphids, and water striders. Unlike beetles, their forewings are partly
          hardened and partly membranous, and they possess distinctive
          piercing-sucking mouthparts. These mouthparts are adapted for feeding
          on plant sap, blood, or other insects. Many true bugs have scent
          glands that produce strong odors as a defense mechanism, which is why
          some are called “stink bugs.”
        </p>

        <p>
          True bugs are found worldwide and occupy a variety of habitats,
          including plants, soil, and water. While some species are harmless or
          even beneficial predators, others are destructive agricultural pests
          that weaken plants by draining their sap. Certain bugs, like bed bugs
          and kissing bugs, can also affect humans directly by biting or
          transmitting diseases.

        <p>
          Butterflies and moths are some of the most recognizable insects thanks
          to their large, often colorful wings covered in tiny scales. These
          scales give their wings shimmering, patterned appearances and are one
          of the defining traits of this group. Butterflies are usually active
          by day, while moths are mostly nocturnal, though there are exceptions.
          Both undergo complete metamorphosis, with a dramatic transformation
          from caterpillar to winged adult.
        </p>

        <p>
          As caterpillars, they primarily feed on leaves, sometimes causing
          damage to crops and plants. As adults, butterflies and many moths are
          important pollinators, transferring pollen as they sip nectar from
          flowers. They are also ecologically vital as food sources for birds,
          bats, and other animals. Their beauty and ecological importance make
          them a favorite group for nature enthusiasts and scientists alike.

          <figcaption>A mosquito.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Flies and mosquitoes belong to the order Diptera, meaning “two wings.”
          Unlike most other insects, they have only one functional pair of
          wings; the hind pair has evolved into tiny balancing organs called
          halteres. This adaptation gives them incredible agility in flight.
          Their mouthparts vary widely: some species have sponging mouthparts
          (like houseflies), while others have piercing-sucking ones (like
          mosquitoes).
        </p>

        <p>
          These insects are among the most ecologically and medically
          significant. Many flies are decomposers, helping break down waste and
          recycle nutrients. Mosquitoes, however, are infamous as disease
          vectors, spreading malaria, dengue, and other illnesses. Despite their
          negative reputation, flies and mosquitoes are essential in ecosystems,
          serving as pollinators and as a major food source for many animals.

        <p>
          Bees, wasps, and ants are a diverse group known for their complex
          behaviors and social structures. Many species live in colonies with
          distinct roles for workers, queens, and males. Bees are especially
          famous for pollination, producing honey, and communicating with each
          other through dances. Wasps are often predators or parasitoids, while
          ants are skilled builders and cooperative foragers.
        </p>

        <p>
          This group has a huge ecological impact. Bees and wasps contribute to
          pollination, supporting food crops and wild plants. Some wasps help
          control pest populations by preying on or parasitizing other insects.
          Ants are critical soil engineers, aerating the ground and recycling
          nutrients. While stings and aggressive behaviors make some species
          feared, they are vital players in natural and agricultural systems.

        <p>
          Spiders are arachnids, not insects, and are easily distinguished by
          their eight legs and lack of antennae. Almost all spiders are
          predators, using venom and silk to capture prey. Many build intricate
          webs to trap insects, while others are active hunters that chase or
          ambush their food. Their silk is an incredibly strong and versatile
          material, used for webs, egg sacs, or safety lines.
        </p>

        <p>
          Spiders are found in nearly every habitat on Earth, from deserts to
          caves to homes. While some people fear them, very few species pose a
          danger to humans. In fact, spiders are highly beneficial because they
          help control insect populations, including pests. They play a crucial
          role in balancing ecosystems, making them one of the most important
          non-insect “bugs” people commonly encounter.

# Challenge: Structuring a page of content

{{PreviousMenuNext("Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Test_your_skills/Links", "Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/HTML_images", "Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content")}}

Structuring a page of content ready for laying it out using CSS is a very important skill to master, so in this challenge you'll be tested on your ability to think about how a page might end up looking, and choose appropriate structural semantics to build a layout on top of.

## Starting point

To solve this challenge we are expecting you to create a simple website project, either inside a folder on your computer's hard drive, or using an online editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/). Much of the code you need is already provided.

1. Create a new folder in an appropriate location on your computer called `structuring-html-challenge` (or open an online editor and take the required steps to create a new project).
2. Save the following HTML listing inside a file inside your folder called `index.html` (or paste it into your online editor's HTML pane).

   ```html
   <!doctype html>
   <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta charset="utf-8" />
       <title>Birdwatching</title>
       <link
         href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto+Condensed:300%7CCinzel+Decorative:700"
         rel="stylesheet" />
     </head>

     <body>
       <h1>Birdwatching</h1>

       Home Get started Photos Gear Forum

       <h2>Welcome</h2>

       <p>
         Welcome to our fake birdwatching site. If this were a real site, it
         would be the ideal place to come to learn more about birdwatching,
         whether you are a beginner looking to learn how to get into birding, or
         an expert wanting to share ideas, tips, and photos with other
         like-minded people.
       </p>

       <p>
         So don't waste time! Get what you need, then turn off that computer and
         get out into the great outdoors!
       </p>

       <h2>Favorite photos</h2>

       <!-- Link images here. -->

   ```

3. Save the following CSS listing inside a file inside your folder called `style.css` (or paste it into your online editor's CSS pane).

   ```css
   /* || General setup */

   body {
     margin: 0;
   }

   html {
     font-size: 10px;
     background-color: darkgrey;
   }

   body {
     width: 70%;
     min-width: 800px;
     margin: 0 auto;
   }

   /* || typography */

   h1,
   h2 {
     font-family: "Cinzel Decorative", cursive;

     text-align: center;
     text-shadow: 2px 2px 10px black;
   }

   h2 {
     font-size: 3rem;
     text-align: center;
   }

   p,
   li {
     font-size: 1.6rem;
     line-height: 1.5;
   }

   /* || header layout */

   header {
     margin-bottom: 10px;
   }

   main,
   header,
   nav,
   article,
   aside,
   footer,
   section {
     background-color: #00ff0080;
     padding: 1%;
   }

   h1 {
     text-transform: uppercase;
     display: flex;
     align-items: center;
     justify-content: center;
     gap: 20px;
   }

   header img {
     height: 60px;
   }

   nav ul {
     padding: 0;
     list-style-type: none;
     display: flex;
   }

   nav li {
     text-align: center;
     flex: 1;
   }

   nav a {
     font-size: 2rem;
     text-transform: uppercase;
     text-decoration: none;
     color: black;
   }

   nav a:hover,
   nav a:focus {
     color: red;
   }

   /* || main layout */

   main {
     display: flex;
     gap: 10px;
   }

   article {
     flex: 4;
   }

   aside {
     flex: 1;
   }

   aside a {
     display: block;
     float: left;
     width: 50%;
   }

   aside img {
     max-width: 100%;
   }

   footer {
     margin-top: 10px;
   }
   ```

Later on, you will need to include the following URLs in your page.

- `dove.png`: [The site logo](https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/learn/birds/dove.png)
- `favorite-bird-1.jpg`: [Full-size version of the first sidebar image](https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/learn/birds/favorite-bird-1.jpg)

## Project brief

For this project, your task is to take the content for the homepage of a bird watching website and add structural elements to it so it can have a page layout applied to it. You also need to make a few additions to the content.

### Content additions

1. Inside the `<h1>` element, add an `<img>` element that includes the dove logo on the page. Give it blank alternative text ("").
2. The "Home", "Get started", "Photos", "Gear", and "Forum" text items should be turned into a navigation menu.
   1. Mark them up as an unordered list.
   2. Inside each list item, wrap the text inside an `<a>` element that points to a URL of `#` (which creates a dummy link).
3. Remove the `<!-- Link images here. -->` comment. Replace it with a set of four thumbnail images of the "favorite birds". Each one should include some appropriate alternative text to describe the image, and be wrapped in an `<a>` element that links to the full-sized equivalent.

### Structural requirements

The site structure needs to consist of the following:

1. A header that wraps the top-level page heading and the navigation menu list.
2. An additional wrapper around the navigation menu list.
3. A main content area containing two columns — a main article to contain the welcome text, and a sidebar (aside) to contain the image thumbnails.
4. A footer containing the copyright information and credits.

In other words, you need to add a suitable wrapper for:

- The header
- The navigation menu
- The main content
- The welcome article
- The image aside
- The footer

### Styling the page

If required, apply the provided CSS to the page by adding another {{htmlelement("link")}} element just below the existing one provided in the starting HTML (some online code editors will apply the CSS automatically).

## Hints and tips

- Use the [W3C HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to catch unintended mistakes in your HTML — so that you can fix them.
- You don't need to know any CSS to do this challenge; you just need to apply the provided CSS to your HTML.
- If you are getting stuck and can't envisage what elements to put where, draw out a simple block diagram of the page layout, and write on the elements you think should wrap each block. This is extremely helpful.

## Example

The following screenshot shows an example of what the homepage might look like after being marked up. If you are getting stuck on how to achieve some of this, see the solution below the live example.

In addition to defining individual parts of your page (such as "a paragraph" or "an image"), {{glossary("HTML")}} also boasts a number of block level elements used to define areas of your website such as "the header", "the navigation menu", or "the main content column". This article looks into how to plan a basic website structure, and write the HTML to represent this structure.

## Basic sections of a document

Webpages can and will look pretty different from one another, but they all tend to share similar standard components, unless the page is displaying a fullscreen video or game, is part of some kind of art project, or is just badly structured:

- header:
  - : Usually a big strip across the top with a big heading, logo, and perhaps a tagline. This usually stays the same from one page of a website to another.
- navigation bar:
  - : Links to the site's main sections; usually represented by menu buttons, links, or tabs. Like the header, this content usually remains consistent from one webpage to another — having inconsistent navigation on your website will just lead to confused, frustrated users. Many web designers consider the navigation bar to be part of the header rather than an individual component, but that's not a requirement; in fact, some also argue that having the two separate is better for [accessibility](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility), as screen readers can read the two features better if they are separate.
- main content:
  - : A big area in the center that contains most of the unique content of a given webpage, for example, the video you want to watch, or the main story you're reading, or the map you want to view, or the news headlines, etc. This is the one part of the website that definitely will vary from page to page!
- sidebar:
  - : Some peripheral info, links, quotes, ads, etc. Usually, this is contextual to what is contained in the main content (for example on a news article page, the sidebar might contain the author's bio, or links to related articles) but there are also cases where you'll find some recurring elements like a secondary navigation system.
- footer:
  - : A strip across the bottom of the page that generally contains fine print, copyright notices, or contact info. It's a place to put common information (like the header) but usually, that information is not critical or secondary to the website itself. The footer is also sometimes used for {{Glossary("SEO")}} purposes, by providing links for quick access to popular content.

A "typical website" could be structured something like this:

![a simple website structure example featuring a main heading, navigation menu, main content, side bar, and footer.](sample-website.png)

> [!NOTE]
> The image above illustrates the main sections of a document, which you can define with HTML. However, the _appearance_ of the page shown here — including the layout, colors, and fonts — is achieved by applying [CSS](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics) to the HTML.

## HTML for structuring content

The example shown above isn't pretty, but it is perfectly fine for illustrating a typical website layout example. Some websites have more columns, some are a lot more complex, but you get the idea. With the right CSS, you could use pretty much any elements to wrap around the different sections and get it looking how you wanted, but as discussed before, we need to respect semantics and **use the right element for the right job**.

This is because visuals don't tell the whole story. We use color and font size to draw sighted users' attention to the most useful parts of the content, like the navigation menu and related links, but what about visually impaired people for example, who might not find concepts like "pink" and "large font" very useful?

> [!NOTE]
> [Roughly 8% of men and 0.5% of women](https://www.color-blindness.com/) are colorblind; or, to put it another way, approximately 1 in every 12 men and 1 in every 200 women. Blind and visually impaired people represent roughly 4-5% of the world population (in 2015 there were [940 million people with some degree of vision loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment), while the total population was [around 7.5 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_human_population#/media/File:World_population_history.svg)).

In your HTML code, you can mark up sections of content based on their _functionality_ — you can use elements that represent the sections of content described above unambiguously, and assistive technologies like screen readers can recognize those elements and help with tasks like "find the main navigation", or "find the main content." As we mentioned earlier in the course, there are a number of [consequences of not using the right element structure and semantics for the right job](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Headings_and_paragraphs#why_do_we_need_structure).

To implement such semantic mark up, HTML provides dedicated tags that you can use to represent such sections, for example:

- **header:** {{htmlelement("header")}}.
- **navigation bar:** {{htmlelement("nav")}}.
- **main content:** {{htmlelement("main")}}, with various content subsections represented by {{HTMLElement("article")}}, {{htmlelement("section")}}, and {{htmlelement("div")}} elements.
- **sidebar:** {{htmlelement("aside")}}; often placed inside {{htmlelement("main")}}.
- **footer:** {{htmlelement("footer")}}.

### Exploring the code for our example

The example seen above is represented by the following code (you can also [find the example in our GitHub repository](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/introduction-to-html/document_and_website_structure/index.html)). We'd like you to look at the listing below to see what parts make up each section of the visual output.

Take some time to look over the code and understand it — the comments inside the code should also help you to understand it. We aren't asking you to do much else in this article, because the key to understanding document layout is writing a sound HTML structure, and then laying it out with CSS. We'll wait for this until you start to study CSS layout as part of the CSS topic.

## HTML layout elements in more detail

It's good to understand the overall meaning of all the HTML sectioning elements in detail — this is something you'll work on gradually as you start to get more experience with web development. You can find a lot of detail by reading our [HTML element reference](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements). For now, these are the main definitions that you should try to understand:

- {{HTMLElement('main')}} is for content _unique to this page._ Use `<main>` only _once_ per page, and put it directly inside {{HTMLElement('body')}}. Ideally this shouldn't be nested within other elements.
- {{HTMLElement('article')}} encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page (for example, a single blog post).
- {{HTMLElement('section')}} is similar to `<article>`, but it is more for grouping together a single part of the page that constitutes one single piece of functionality (like a mini map, or a set of article headlines and summaries), or a theme. It's considered best practice to begin each section with a [heading](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Headings_and_paragraphs); also note that you can break `<article>`s up into different `<section>`s, or `<section>`s up into different `<article>`s, depending on the context.
- {{HTMLElement('aside')}} contains content that is not directly related to the main content but can provide additional information indirectly related to it (glossary entries, author biography, related links, etc.).
- {{HTMLElement('header')}} represents a group of introductory content. If it is a child of {{HTMLElement('body')}} it defines the global header of a webpage, but if it's a child of an {{HTMLElement('article')}} or {{HTMLElement('section')}} it defines a specific header for that section (try not to confuse this with [titles and headings](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Webpage_metadata#adding_a_title)).
- {{HTMLElement('nav')}} contains the main navigation functionality for the page. Secondary links, etc., would not go in the navigation.
- {{HTMLElement('footer')}} represents a group of end content for a page.

Each of the aforementioned elements can be clicked on to read the corresponding article in the "HTML element reference" section, providing more detail about each one.

### Non-semantic wrappers

Sometimes you'll come across a situation where you can't find an ideal semantic element to group some items together or wrap some content. Sometimes you might want to just group a set of elements together to affect them all as a single entity with some {{glossary("CSS")}} or {{glossary("JavaScript")}}. For cases like these, HTML provides the {{HTMLElement("div")}} and {{HTMLElement("span")}} elements. You should use these preferably with a suitable [`class`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/class) attribute, to provide some kind of label for them so they can be easily targeted.

{{HTMLElement("span")}} is an inline non-semantic element, which you should only use if you can't think of a better semantic text element to wrap your content, or don't want to add any specific meaning. For example:

```html
<p>
  The King walked drunkenly back to his room at 01:00, the beer doing nothing to
  aid him as he staggered through the door.
  <span class="editor-note">
    [Editor's note: At this point in the play, the lights should be down low].
  </span>
</p>
```

In this case, the editor's note is supposed to merely provide extra direction for the director of the play; it is not supposed to have extra semantic meaning. For sighted users, CSS would perhaps be used to distance the note slightly from the main text.

{{HTMLElement("div")}} is a block level non-semantic element, which you should only use if you can't think of a better semantic block element to use, or don't want to add any specific meaning. For example, imagine a shopping cart widget that you could choose to pull up at any point during your time on an e-commerce site:

```html-nolint
<div class="shopping-cart">
  <h2>Shopping cart</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <a href=""><strong>Silver earrings</strong></a>: $99.95.
      </p>
      <img src="../products/3333-0985/thumb.png" alt="Silver earrings" />
    </li>
    <li>…</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Total cost: $237.89</p>
</div>
```

This isn't really an `<aside>`, as it doesn't necessarily relate to the main content of the page (you want it viewable from anywhere). It doesn't even particularly warrant using a `<section>`, as it isn't part of the main content of the page. So a `<div>` is fine in this case. We've included a heading as a signpost to aid screen reader users in finding it.

> [!WARNING]
> Divs are so convenient to use that it's easy to use them too much. As they carry no semantic value, they just clutter your HTML code. Take care to use them only when there is no better semantic solution and try to reduce their usage to the minimum otherwise you'll have a hard time updating and maintaining your documents.

> [!NOTE]
> Scrimba's [Semantic HTML](https://scrimba.com/learn-accessible-web-design-c031/~0b?via=mdn) <sup>[_MDN learning partner_](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Learning_content#partner_links_and_embeds)</sup> interactive tutorial provides a useful recap of semantic markup and why you should use it, plus a challenge that tests your ability to improve an HTML codebase with semantic elements.

### Line breaks and horizontal rules

Two elements that you'll use occasionally and will want to know about are {{htmlelement("br")}} and {{htmlelement("hr")}}.

#### \<br>: the line break element

`<br>` creates a line break in a paragraph; it is the only way to force a rigid structure in a situation where you want a series of fixed short lines, such as in a postal address or a poem. For example:

```html
<p>
  There once was a man named O'Dell<br />
  Who loved to write HTML<br />
  But his structure was bad, his semantics were sad<br />
  and his markup didn't read very well.
</p>
```

Without the `<br>` elements, the paragraph would just be rendered in one long line (as we said earlier in the course, [HTML ignores most whitespace](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Basic_HTML_syntax#whitespace_in_html)); with `<br>` elements in the code, the markup renders like this:

{{EmbedLiveSample('br_the_line_break_element', '100%', 150)}}

#### \<hr>: the thematic break element

`<hr>` elements create a horizontal rule in the document that denotes a thematic change in the text (such as a change in topic or scene). Visually it just looks like a horizontal line. As an example:

```html
<p>
  Ron was backed into a corner by the marauding netherbeasts. Scared, but
  determined to protect his friends, he raised his wand and prepared to do
  battle, hoping that his distress call had made it through.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
  Meanwhile, Harry was sitting at home, staring at his royalty statement and
  pondering when the next spin off series would come out, when an enchanted
  distress letter flew through his window and landed in his lap. He read it
  hazily and sighed; "better get back to work then", he mused.
</p>
```

Would render like this:

{{EmbedLiveSample('hr_the_thematic_break_element', '100%', '185px')}}

## Structuring a basic website

The next stage after planning out the structure of a single webpage is to plan out the structure of a whole multi-page website, including how they should be arranged and link to one another for the best possible user experience. This is called {{glossary("Information architecture")}}.

In a large, complex website, a lot of planning can go into this process, but for a basic website with a few pages, it can be a quick and fun exercise.

The process might look like this:

1. You'll have a few elements common to most (if not all) pages — such as the navigation menu, and the footer content. If your site is for a business, for example, it's a good idea to have your contact information available in the footer on each page. Note down what you want to have common to every page. For example:
   - Header:
     - Title and logo
     - Site language chooser
   - Navigation menu
   - Footer:
     - Copyright notice
     - Link to terms and conditions, contact details, and accessibility policy

2. Next, draw a rough sketch of what you might want the structure of each page to look like (it might look like our simple website above). Note what each block is going to be.![A simple diagram of a sample site structure, with a header, main content area, two optional sidebars, and footer](/shared-assets/images/diagrams/learn/structuring-documents/site-structure.svg)
3. Now, brainstorm all the other (not common to every page) content you want to have on your website. For example:
   - Flights
   - Accommodation
   - Transport
   - Things to do
   - Special offers
   - Popular holiday packages, for example winter sun, skiing
   - Search results
   - Reviews
   - Visa/entry requirements
   - Currency
   - Languages and culture
   - Buy holidays

4. Next, try to sort all these content items into groups, to give you an idea of what parts might live together on different pages. This is very similar to a technique called {{glossary("Card sorting")}}.
   - Search
     - Flights
     - Accommodation
     - Transport
     - Things to do
   - Special offers
     - Popular holidays
     - Winter sun
     - Skiing
   - Search results
     - Reviews
     - Country-specific info
       - Visa/entry requirements
       - Currency
       - Languages and culture
   - Buy holidays

5. Now try to sketch a rough sitemap — have a box for each page on your site, and draw lines to show the typical workflow between pages. The homepage will probably be in the top or at the center, and link to most if not all of the others. Most of the pages in a small site should be available from the main navigation, although there are exceptions. You might also want to include notes about how things might be presented.![A map of the site showing the homepage, country page, search results, specials page, and checkout and purchase flow](/shared-assets/images/diagrams/learn/structuring-documents/site-map.svg)

Try carrying out the above exercise for a website of your own creation. What would you like to make a site about? As a stretch goal, use the HTML knowledge you've gained so far to create a few of the pages on the site. You could use our [basic HTML template](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/introduction-to-html/getting-started/index.html) as a starting point.

## Summary

At this point, you should have a better idea about how to structure a web page/site. In the next article of this module, we'll look at how to create hyperlinks, one of the fundamental features of the web.
