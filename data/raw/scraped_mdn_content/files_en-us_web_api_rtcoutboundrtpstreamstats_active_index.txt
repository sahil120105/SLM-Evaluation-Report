# RTCOutboundRtpStreamStats: active property

{{APIRef("WebRTC")}}{{SeeCompatTable}}

The **`active`** property of the {{domxref("RTCOutboundRtpStreamStats")}} dictionary is a boolean that indicates whether this RTP stream is configured to be sent, or is disabled.

For example, this would be `false` if the track corresponding to the stream had its {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack.enabled")}} property set to `false`.
Note that an active stream may still not be sending if, for example, the stream is limited by network conditions.

## Value

`true` if the stream is enabled for sending, `false` otherwise.
