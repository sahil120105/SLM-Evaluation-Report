# 424 Failed Dependency

The HTTP **`424 Failed Dependency`** [client error response](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#client_error_responses) status code indicates that the method could not be performed on the resource because the requested action depended on another action, and that action failed.

Regular web servers typically do not return this status code, but some protocols like {{Glossary("WebDAV")}} can return it.
For example, in {{Glossary("WebDAV")}}, if a `PROPPATCH` request was issued, and one command fails then automatically every other command will also fail with `424 Failed Dependency`.
