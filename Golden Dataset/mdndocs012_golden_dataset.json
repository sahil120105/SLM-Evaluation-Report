    "question": "How does abstraction improve software design in computer programming?",
    "answer": "Abstraction reduces complexity by hiding technical implementation details behind simpler APIs. It helps avoid writing low-level code, prevents code duplication, increases reusability, and enhances security by exposing only important details to the user."
  },
  {
    "question": "I want to change the color of the active portion of a checkbox. Which CSS property should I use?",
    "answer": "You can use the `accent-color` CSS property with a `<color>` value to set the accent color for elements like inputs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What tools can I use to measure the accessibility (A11y) of my website?",
    "answer": "You can use tools like Lighthouse and the Firefox Accessibility Inspector to measure accessibility. Ensuring compatibility with assistive technologies like screen readers and magnifiers is also essential."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the browser generate the information used by screen readers?",
    "answer": "The browser converts the DOM tree into an accessibility tree. This tree contains objects with properties like name, description, role, and state, which platform-specific Accessibility APIs use to represent the UI to assistive technologies."
  },
  {
    "question": "What properties are typically found in an accessibility tree object?",
    "answer": "An accessibility tree object typically contains four properties: name (how to refer to the object), description (additional context), role (what kind of thing it is, e.g., button), and state (current condition, e.g., checked or collapsed)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the precedence order for computing an element's accessible description?",
    "answer": "The accessible description is computed in this order: `aria-describedby`, `aria-description`, language-specific features (like `<summary>` inside `<details>`), and finally the `title` attribute if not used for the accessible name. If none are defined, the description is empty."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is an element's accessible name calculated if it has both visible content and an `aria-label`?",
    "answer": "The accessible name calculation depends on the element, but `aria-label` generally overrides visible content. For example, if an element has `aria-label`, that value is used. If not, it may derive the name from visible content (like button text) or associated elements (like a label)."
  },
  {

  },
  {
    "question": "Why does `btoa` throw an error with some Unicode characters?",
    "answer": "`btoa` treats strings as binary data where each character represents a byte. If a character's code point exceeds `0xff` (255), it cannot fit in a byte, causing `btoa` to throw an error."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does a 'widely available' Baseline badge indicate?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What layout behavior defines block-level content?",
    "answer": "Block-level content starts on a new line and occupies the entire available horizontal space of its parent, creating a 'block' equal to the height of its contents."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are block ciphers used with a mode of operation?",
    "answer": "Block ciphers encrypt fixed-size blocks (e.g., 16 bytes). A mode of operation (like GCM or CBC) specifies how to securely encrypt messages that are longer than that fixed block size."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const` regarding bindings?",
