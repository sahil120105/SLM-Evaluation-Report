# OverconstrainedError: OverconstrainedError() constructor

{{APIRef("Media Capture and Streams")}}

The **`OverconstrainedError()`** constructor
creates a new {{domxref("OverconstrainedError")}} object which indicates that the set of
desired capabilities for the current {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack")}} cannot currently be
met. When this event is thrown on a `MediaStreamTrack`, it is muted until
either the current constraints can be established or until satisfiable constraints are
applied.

## Syntax

```js-nolint
new OverconstrainedError()
```

### Parameters

- `constraint`
  - : The constraint that was not satisfied.
- `message` {{optional_inline}}
  - : Text for the error's `message` property. Defaults to an empty string.
