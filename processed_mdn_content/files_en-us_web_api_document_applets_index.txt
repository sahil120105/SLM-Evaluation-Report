# Document: applets property

{{APIRef("DOM")}} {{Deprecated_Header}}

The **`applets`** property of the {{domxref("Document")}} returns an empty {{domxref("HTMLCollection")}}. This property is kept only for compatibility reasons; in older versions of browsers, it returned a list of the applets within a document.

> [!NOTE]
> Support for the `<applet>` element has been removed by all browsers. Therefore, calling `document.applets` always
> returns an empty collection.
