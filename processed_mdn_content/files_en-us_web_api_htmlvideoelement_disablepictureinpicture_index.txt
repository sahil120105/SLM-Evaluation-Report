# HTMLVideoElement: disablePictureInPicture property

{{APIRef("Picture-in-Picture API")}}

The {{domxref("HTMLVideoElement")}} **`disablePictureInPicture`** property reflects the HTML attribute indicating whether the picture-in-picture feature is disabled for the current element.

This value only represents a request from the website to the user agent. User configuration may change the eventual behavior—for example, Firefox users can change the `media.videocontrols.picture-in-picture.respect-disablePictureInPicture` setting to ignore the request to disable PiP.

## Value

A boolean value that is `true` if the picture-in-picture feature is disabled for this element. This means that the user agent should not suggest that feature to users, or request it automatically.
