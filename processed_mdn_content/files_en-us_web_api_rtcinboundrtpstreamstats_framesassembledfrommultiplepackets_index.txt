# RTCInboundRtpStreamStats: framesAssembledFromMultiplePackets property

{{APIRef("WebRTC")}}{{SeeCompatTable}}

The **`framesAssembledFromMultiplePackets`** property of the {{domxref("RTCInboundRtpStreamStats")}} dictionary indicates the total number of correctly decoded frames for this RTP stream that were assembled from more than one RTP packet.

This property can be used with {{domxref("RTCInboundRtpStreamStats/totalAssemblyTime","totalAssemblyTime")}} to determine the average assembly time: `totalAssemblyTime / framesAssembledFromMultiplePacket`.
A higher average assembly time might indicate network issues or inefficiencies in the receiving pipeline.
